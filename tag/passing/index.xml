In the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em>, mostly everything is generalized and for the benefit of the reader but there was a section titled &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-02-17-0202160131-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obituary&lt;/a> and it was interesting because it was on one specific person. As I read I realized that even though she did just seem like another local, the point of the article was to show how &lt;a href="http://www.globalthinkersforum.org/our-impact/each-and-everyone-of-us-is-unique-and-important-and-no-one-is-insignificant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every citizen is important&lt;/a> and it made sure to explain how she was a quality person and her death was to be mourned as many of the locals in Luxor and Cairo cared for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Each and Everyone of Us Is Unique and Important, and No-one Is Insignificant”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I find this fascinating because there are two other instances I found while browsing through the blog posts in which the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em> has done this.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-23-baenen-deathofthepasha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the death of Haicalis Pasha&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-fitzpatrick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of Mr. Hanna&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In both instances the newsletter is reporting local deaths and it shows that the community do care about its people and that no passing is meaningless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the important things that was pointed out in the Obituary is how Miss Collins spent a majority of her time at church and actually passed while at a Sunday Service. It is safe to assume that she is now in &lt;a href="https://www.everystudent.com/journeys/then.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heaven&lt;/a> because not only did she realize God but also lived an honest life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
