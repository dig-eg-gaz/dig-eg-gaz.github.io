In this issue of the newspaper, on the third page, there was an article referring to a recent seize of Â£5,000 worth Hashish from Mr. H.C. Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s home. The article was published in the newspaper next to the Government Measures column.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article explained that Mr. Parkinson, the owner of the home, kept hearing strange noises in his house, and when he went to look around he was surprised to see a light on in his kitchen. He brushed it off and went back to sleep, but awoke to more noises. Arming himself with a loaded revolver, he went outside and stumbled over a large sack and soon realized that hashish was being landed. Mr. Parkinson rang the Coast Guard and when they arrived they found eighteen sacks of hashish around the enclosure. The selling price of this amount of hashish costs L.E. 5,000.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s suffragee was to blame for the amount of hashish and was taken into custody. It was found that the hashish brought over was from Greece, and ten smugglers were burying it up from Mr. Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s yard when it all belonged to the suffragee. Was it a random act or were the smugglers trying to get Mr. Parkinson in trouble? Was the suffragee trying to get Mr. Parkinson in trouble? No follow ups arised in the future columns, but to my understanding the sufragee is still in jail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bad Guys</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-jones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-jones/</guid><description>&lt;p>The article I decided to write my blog post on was about Russian Terrorism in Alexandria. I found this article on page 3 of the Tuesday edition of January 23, 1907. I chose this article because of how interesting the topic was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article talks about how the Russian Consulate in Alexandria had reason to believe that three individuals were contemplating undergoing the task of causing harm to public security. The article explains that these three terrorists had sympathy towards the Russian revolutionary parties causing them to want to strike terror into the autocracy. The terrorists were caught due to the police receiving a warning and keeping a close eye on the small group of menacing men. The men had begun to purchase metals and chemical products that were normally used by private manufacturing companies in order to make high explosives. These suspicions were confirmed when the Captain of a Russian Steamer received a letter from the leader of the terrorist group asking the captain for 5,000 roubles to the boatswain of his vessel to be paid to the Russian Revolutionary Society of Alexandria, and if he failed to do so he would be killed and his ship destroyed. This lead to the three men being arrested and a search by the police found incriminating documents and materials for explosives. Their plan was to put the explosives in the engines of the Russian steamer. These explosives had a two-hour timer set to explode once the steamer had left port. This article was interesting because it shows how Alexandria was affected from the outside world other than just interference from England.&lt;/p>
