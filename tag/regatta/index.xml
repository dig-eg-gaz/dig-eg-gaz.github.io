For the majority of this week, though, the section featured a regatta hosted by the Khedival Yacht Club. Unlike cricket, a regatta is a series of boat races, so I initially found its placement in the newspaper odd, until reading this sub article:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yachting has apparently found an audience in Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s sporting community, so much so that private owners with large money influences have begun to participate in races. (That is how I understand it at least.) I figured some additional research into these races was warranted:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1907 &amp;ndash; &lt;em>The Motor Boat: Devoted to All Types of Power Craft&lt;/em>, Volume 4, Issue 12, by Francis P. Prial pg. 43: Prial mentions the waters near Alexandria and in Egypt in general as &amp;ldquo;splendid facilities for motorboating&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and how these waters were not receiving enough attention from craft owners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the central theme in this source is motorboats, not yachts, I feel the source warrants mentioning because ideal waters might be a reason for the success that yachting in Alexandria had seen, and because the author also speaks highly of the Khedival Yacht Club.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1908 &amp;ndash; &lt;em>Encyclopaedia of Ships and Shipping&lt;/em>, by Herbert B. Mason, pg. 328: A general definition of the Khedival Yacht Club: &amp;ldquo;Established 1902. Patron, H. H. the Khedive of Egypt ; Commodore, H.H. Prince Aziz Pacha Hassan&amp;hellip;Entrance fee, £3 ; annual subscription, £2.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the mention of an entrance fee, I assume that anyone could have participated in the regattas, and that the aforementioned private owners had the money to invest in elite crafts that could win races.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1907 &amp;ndash; &lt;em>Fore&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;aft&lt;/em>, Volume 11, pg. 62: The Khedival Yacht Club is hailed as &amp;ldquo;the only important organization of its kind in Egypt&amp;hellip; and now has two hundred and thirty members and a fleet of fifty yachts. Weekly regattas are held in fort and numerous enjoyable social functions at the handsome club house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, here are the results of the week in question&amp;rsquo;s regatta:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Ananke, a privately owned craft favored by the newspaper to win the race in its class, could not withstand the wind and waters that day, and had to forfeit the race.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
