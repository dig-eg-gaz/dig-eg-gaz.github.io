&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I began the research process, I constantly ran into information about various plagues: specifically the Bubonic Plague. What appeared less frequently, however, was cattle plague. Upon seeing an excerpt on page 3 of the 1904-12-16 issue of The Egyptian Gazette, I delved deeper. What is &amp;ldquo;bovine typhus&amp;rdquo; and why was it important to the readers of The Egyptian Gazette?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rinderpest&#34;&gt;Rinderpest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cattle Plague, also known as Rinderpest, entered Africa in the 1880s most likely from the shipment of cattle from Arabia or Bombay. Many Egyptians urged the government to take action against this through trade restrictions; however, the Egyptian government needed to import cattle to have enough for the country. Instead, the government set up a quarantine site for any cattle and sheep entering the country. Despite their efforts, the plague entered Egypt in 1903 due to a lack of knowledge about the symptoms in bovine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epidemic&amp;rsquo;s effects were disastrous in Egypt. Symptoms included diarrhea, high fever, oral erosions, lymphoid necrosis, etc. Many cattle met their demise. According to The Egyptian Gazette, as of 1904-12-16, an estimated 146,649 cattle had died from the plague. This explains the significance of the coverage in the newspaper. It is important to the readers of the paper to understand the status of the cattle plague so they can keep their bovine healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-egyptian-gazette&#34;&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became curious about what section of The Egyptian Gazette the cattle plague appeared in most frequently, so I ran a simple Xpath Query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(., &#39;cattle plague&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This searched for the term &amp;ldquo;cattle plague&amp;rdquo; within any feature of The Egyptian Gazette. It returned 68 hits, and I found that the cattle plague appeared most in the Local and General sections of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pink Pills: Stronger Than Death</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-16-phuong/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-16-phuong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pills and medicines have relentlessly shown themselves throughout the Egyptian Gazette as miraculous solutions to peoples&amp;rsquo; problems. This piece called &amp;ldquo;STRONGER THAN DEATH&amp;rdquo; begins with stating its purpose: to add more evidence that Pink Pills work. The story of a woman&amp;rsquo;s tragedy plays out in which she develops accumulating sickness after having many children in a short span of time. The sickness only worsens as she finds out her husband had died falling, trying to get out of a tram car in America. The story goes on with how she healed to the point of full health after discovering the existence of the pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this article seems to be more about promoting an idea than a real cure. What offsets its validity as a medicine is the idea that it could cure numerous types of sicknesses. &amp;ldquo;They cure anaemia, chlorosis, general debility, stom-ach complaints, rheumatism and neurasthenia.&amp;rdquo; Targeting the population, it uses several tactics. The article appeals to the entire audience, saying &amp;ldquo;Everyone must agree&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;they will do for everybody&amp;rdquo; and more. The article uses a relatable and pained main character that the people would feel sorry for, appealing to human emotions when the descriptions of her life and tragedies such as her husband dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From this instance one learns what Pink Pills can achieve for the weak and enfeebled.&amp;rdquo; This statement paints the pill as a wondrous cure that saves people from weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was that these stories of the use of phenomenal Pink Pills may be continuous and confirm their worth. In this &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-wallace/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that the pill has before already been called &amp;ldquo;Pink Pills are said to cure Anaemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy.&amp;rdquo; This article &amp;ldquo;STRONGER THAN DEATH&amp;rdquo; links back to that with the mention of some of those same sicknesses. The author gives more depth to the pill&amp;rsquo;s contents and how the pills are a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Sultan&#39;s Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-13-jimmymendez/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the month of September issues of the Egyptian Gazette, the newspaper talks about the Sultan&#39;s illness. Specifically, in page three of the September 21st issue of 1906, the Sultan is mentioned and the author says he has Bright&#39;s disease. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright%27s_disease&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This disease was named after Richard Bright, a physician.&lt;/a&gt; It was a disease pertaining to the kidney, but was later discovered to be a classification of a variety of kidney diseases that were unknown at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      A kidney with Bright&amp;rsquo;s Disease
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patient with this disease could experience swelling, convulsions, blindness, and coma. A lot of patients with this disease may have also had high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. The newspaper mentions Dr. Nafiz, and Dr. Noureddin Pasha as the primary physicians of the Sultan, but it mentions that they had to consult Professor Bergmann for assistance. Bergmann was the one to diagnose the Sultan with Bright&#39;s disease, and ordered an immediate surgical operation. He also says that he is suffering from &amp;quot;other complications,&amp;quot; which may be anything from diabetes to heart disease to kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160915235645/https:/www.guideline.gov/summaries/summary/36900&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Today, a patient with the same symptoms would be likely diagnosed with chronic nephritis, which is an inflammation of the kidney.&lt;/a&gt; However, in the Thursday issue, it is mentioned that the Sultan was suffering from a stone. This means that he may have had a urinary tract infection. The most common cause of a UTI is  Escherichia coli, or similar fungi. Other causes may include genetic predisposition or being uncircumcised. What exactly caused the Sultan to be ill is unknown, however, the diagnosis at the time was based on similar cases. Richard Bright attributed the disease to high blood pressure and diabetes, which could have been true in the Sultan&#39;s case, as he mourned the recent death of two high functionaries, one of which &amp;quot;enjoyed his majesty&#39;s confidence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pink Pills for Pale People</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-wallace/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the age of clickbait, tabloid papers, and fake news, it&amp;rsquo;s still nice to see that we haven&amp;rsquo;t changed a bit. This is a classic example of a snake oil salesmen at work. Dr. Williams&amp;rsquo; Pink Pills are said to cure Anaemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, Sciatica, St. Vitus’ Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy. Since the pills did have ferrous sulphate or just Iron sulphate, it would have an effect on the anemic. This however, is still a scam because the amount that was in his pink pills was much less than actual medicine and because of this, the pills were much weaker and were more expensive than just the regular iron pills doctors would usually prescribe. This is probably one of the only pills that are in song, while the song is a critique of commercialism in society, it was sung by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu2V3TkHufA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Benny Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Also something that intrigued me was that you can still &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.springbokpharmacy.co.za/Product?product_id=354130&amp;amp;category_id=33098&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;buy these pills&lt;/a&gt; online to cure basically anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more &lt;a href=&#34;https://diseasesofmodernlife.org/2016/11/29/pills-for-our-ills-dr-williams-pink-pills-for-pale-people/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;elaborate backstory&lt;/a&gt; of the company and pills, as well as how they fared in Asian markets.
[Pink Pills](1907-05-20-p5 selection)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend of snake oil pills being sold in The Egyptian Gazette is not a new one. Looking through other blog posts I saw a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Esteve-Medicine/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; about &amp;ldquo;Doan&amp;rsquo;s Backache Kidney Pills&amp;rdquo;. The man who used it was told he only had 3 months to live but after some pills, he made a miraculous recovery! Another post follows the same vein of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/baxter-Peruna/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;miraculous medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
