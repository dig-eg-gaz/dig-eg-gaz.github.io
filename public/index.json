of the Digital Egyptian Gazette project.\nAbout The Egyptian Gazette, a daily newspaper catering to English and French speaking residents of Alexandria, began publication in 1880. This website is product of a digital microhistory course at Florida State University, which was offered for the first time in fall 2016. The aim of this course is to produce a digital version of the paper for the years 1905-8, including full structure and content markup. This website presents the contents of the paper, and host student analysis of our findings.\nFor more information, contact Will Hanley by email.\nCourse description Through close reading of the Egyptian Gazette, an English-language daily newspaper published in Alexandria, we will compile comprehensive data about local events during a single year, 1905. Each student will be responsible for one week (6 issues, totaling 40 pages) of the paper; together we will cover the year.\nThis class brings together\nmicrohistory, urban history, Middle Eastern history, media history, and digital history. It is suitable for those interested in\nhistory Middle East studies digital humanities computer science communications international studies history of journalism and advertising No background in these fields is necessary, however.\nWe will gather this data using digital methods. Students will learn to use:\nmicrofilm photo stitching (Microsoft Image Composite Editor) optical character recognition (AABBY FineReader) project management (Github) XML editor (Oxygen) Text Encoding Initiative tags name authority files (Prosop) mapping software (Google Maps Engine, GOAD fire insurance maps 1905) The class is composed of labs and workshops, not lectures.\nWe then work together to represent those events in a website that will employ a variety of digital communication tools. This website will present serial data and analysis concerning:\nlocal crime news\ninternational events\ncommodity prices\nshipping\npassenger arrivals and departures\nweather\nthe stock market\nadvertising\nsports scores\nscience news\nand much, much more!\n","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1566950400,"objectID":"b19066f515b030ede8b37d7a9ead8692","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/resources/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/","section":"resources","summary":"Resources for the use of the Digital Egyptian Gazette.","tags":null,"title":"Resources","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course-specific instructions How to produce blog posts How to write small tutorials How to submit serial question analysis How to revise templates How to contribute to Wikipedia Further instructions (to come in future semesters) [How to map places mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette] [How to identify people mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette] [How to identify organizations and institutions mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette] ","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1566950400,"objectID":"38fdea772e01bfc7e1ca66999885292a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/course-specific/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/course-specific/","section":"how-to","summary":"Tutorials for course requirements of IDS 2681.","tags":null,"title":"Course-specific instructions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"1. Fork the repository Fork a copy of the organization blog-posts repository on your personal github account. Do this by clicking on the “fork” icon on the top right. You will be offered the chance to fork the repository under your own username–do so. This will make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, in which you should save your draft blog posts.\n2. Set up your post Make a duplicate of the YYYY-MM-DD-name folder, leaving the original in place. Rename the duplicate folder with today’s date and your name. This is the folder where you will put your blog post. The folder contains a file named index.md. Open this file in a plain text editor such as Atom or Sublime Text.\n3. Fill in the header The header (the material in the opening lines of the document, between the two — lines) is very important. It tells the website how to treat your blog post. Replace the comments (\u0026lt;!--insert--\u0026gt;) in the header. Give your post a title and provide a one to two sentence summary. For author, give your full name with no spaces (for me, this is [willhanley]). List a few tags that reflect the subject matter that your post covers. Enter the date. Keep the category [curiosities].\n4. Choose a feature image Choose an image that you would like to appear to promote the post on the main page of the website. Name that image featured.jpg or featured.png (depending on the file format), and add it to your blog post folder (replacing the featured.png file that’s already there). You do not need to add any more information about the image to the header, other than giving it a caption in the appropriate section. (For more on images, see number 5 below.)\n4. Write a post in markdown and add images You will write your text using Markdown, a very simple markup language but a different one from xml, which you are using for the newspaper pages. Here’s a tutorial and here’s a cheatsheet. Aim for at least 200 words, but it’s fine if you write more. Integrate some links into your post (especially to previous blog posts on similar topics), and use an image or two.\n5. Working with images Include an image clipped from your issue of the paper, and any other images that might add to the impact of your post. If you are using an image that you find on the internet, make sure that you have the right to reuse it, and download the image (don’t just link to it).\nYour feature image will not appear in the body of your post unless you insert it, using this syntax:\n![label](featured.jpg)\nTo include other images in your post, add the image file to the folder. Then, add a line to the blog post in the following format: ![Image label](image-file-name.png \u0026#34;Caption\u0026#34;). The “Caption” information is optional, but encouraged.\n6. Complete your author page I want to give you credit on the website for the work you do. In order to tell everyone who you are, change the YourNameNoSpaces folder in your blog folder. Rename it using your first and last name without spaces. Then open the index file within the folder and add your own information, as you like. Remember to supply your github username. You can also replace the avatar image with one of your own choosing if you like (just make sure it’s square).\n7. Send a pull request to the group repository When your blog post and image are ready, you can fold them back into the organization content repository by sending me a pull request. You do this by clicking the “new pull request” button the top left above your list of files. I will then see the pull request and either merge your files into the organization’s content or request that you change something before doing so.\n","date":1570492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570492800,"objectID":"4864b1a8a23d305126cfc6950327c2c4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/course-specific/blogging-instructions/","publishdate":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/course-specific/blogging-instructions/","section":"how-to","summary":"1.

Explain this question (supplying, for instance, the xpath formula you will use), and explain how you extract the results. For guidance on queries, consult the tutorial.\nTo consult previous serial analysis projects, see this directory.\nHow do I format my serial analysis? Write your file in markdown, just as you did for the blog post.\nUse a header containing these lines. Supply the title, your name, and the date:\n--- title: \u0026#34;YourTitle\u0026#34; authors: [YourName] date: YYYY-MM-DDD categories: [analysis] --- Name this file index.md.\nWhat about images? Please produce data visualization(s) to accompany your analysis.\nYou may use a variety of tools:\nPalladio Google charts Tableau How do I show these visualizations in my markdown page? The easiest thing to do is to take a screenshot and include the static image using markdown’s code: ![image title](image-file-name.png).\nIf, however, you have produced an interactive visualization using Tableau or Google Charts, you need to do two things to embed data visualizations in your markdown github pages.\n1. Host the visualization: For Tableau:\nUpload your workbook to Tableau Public’s server. Use the “server” drop down menu and follow instructions. You will need to sign up for an online account, and you might have to save your dataset.\nFor Google Charts:\nPost your code as a gist, then render it using a link from githack.\n2. Embed the visualization: For Tableau:\nA complete version of embedding instructions is included in this excellent tutorial. Briefly, you need to click the share icon at the bottom right hand side of your web-hosted visualization. Take the link that it offers and paste it into this code:\n\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/YOURURLHERE?:showVizHome=no\u0026amp;:embed=true\u0026#34; align=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;90%\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; (For the YOURURLHERE part, include everything to the right of views/ and to the left of the question mark. Your line should look something like this: \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/MESAPresentation/Honorifics?:showVizHome=no\u0026amp;:embed=true\u0026#34; align=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;90%\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;.) Paste this code into your markdown file.\nFor Google Charts:\nPlace the following bit of code in a markdown file, and your visualization should appear: \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;your-githack-link\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;90%\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;400\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\nHow do I submit my individual project? Fork the analysis repository. Then, make a folder called named 19-analysis-yourSurname and add it to this fork. Add your analysis text file (named index.md) to this folder, as well as your images. Make sure that you have no spaces in your file names–use dashes instead. Once your folder is complete, send a pull request. Do this at least twice: first you’ve finished a draft, and a second time once you’ve completed your analysis. It is fine to do it more often too, sending partial material or drafts. I will make comments, and you can revise them.\nHow do we submit our group work? One member of the group should add a folder named 19-analysis-yourGroupTopic to their fork of the analysis repository. This folder should be structured the same as the individual project: an index.md file and image files. In the author: line of the markdown header, list all members of the group.\nDirectory of Previous Analysis Projects IDS 2681 Fall 2019 Surname Title An Accidental Analysis Crisafulli Emotions and Accidents Grant Polo in Egypt: An Attendance Analysis House The Geography of Accidents Kamata Comparing Location and Speed to Analyze the Effectiveness of Communication Nguyen Accidents Linguistics Walter Alexandria Fire Accidents Medicine Dorsey Diseases and the Medical Schools/Hospitals History Heflin Tuberculosis and Medicine Himmel Cholera Naranjo The Plague Theophilopoulos Medical Terminology Sports Faynberg Polo in Egypt: An Attendance Analysis Hesse Hayes Billiards Participants Reynolds Home Field Advantage in Football Roche Horse Racing in 1907 Heat of the Sun Hernandez Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Alexandria, Egypt(May 1906-April 1907) Monaco Maximum Heat of the Sun in Different Stations Across Alexandria [May 1906-April 1907] Seguin Minimum Temperatures of Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez [1906-1907] Smith Wind speeds in relation to the heat of the sun Economic History of Stocks and Shares Chen The Mystery of Daira Sanieh Kim Egypt Stocks \u0026amp; Shares Kolby Ku Egypt’s Cotton Exports in the Early 1900s Mendez Gold Mining and the Gold Market:To What Extent does the Nile Valley Gold Company Reflect the Gold Market?

One important step of this revision is to check one specific element/section/div across the full run of the Digital Egyptian Gazette.\n1. Preparation Before you start revising our project, you will need to have your fork of the content repository updated. (You can do this using pull requests). Download your folk of the content repository through Github Desktop and make a project or worksheet in your Oxygen XML Editor that covers all of the files you want to look at.\nThen, choose the element/section/div that you might want to revise, and find the template for it on our website. List that feature or element on this spreadsheet, to be sure that you are not duplicating someone else’s work.\n2. Finding an Element to Revise Look at the template and think about the possible values that might appear if someone just copied the template and left it unchanged. Use the characteristics (such as type/element/feature/xml:id/scope) that defined your targeted div to do XPath queries.\nFor example, you can search //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-shli01\u0026#34;] to find all the specific tables in all files that associated with the xml id of “deg-ta-shli01”.\nUse more specific queries to search for the possible values that might appear. For example, the first value in the Share List (template 1) on our website is “13 13/16”. And it is always in the 3rd cell of the 1st row of the first table of the Share List. Thus, we can use //div[table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-shli01\u0026#34;]/row[1]/cell[3]/measure to locate all the unchanged “13 13/16” in our files by using Find/Replace in Files.\nAfter you get all the possible result, compare more values in your targets and make sure that you only deal with those unchanged ones. Keep it mind that it is very possible that your result has the same value with the template by accident. Play with other values or queries to get the best result.\n3. Avoiding Conflicts Because you will be changing a large number of files, we need to proceed carefully in order to avoid creating conflicts with others’ changes. We will do this in two ways. First, you will write a markdown file documenting your revision logic, findings, and process. This process must be replicable and duplicable. Obviously you may be doing some work by hand as well, but describe the general process in this way. Second, we will make all of our changes on the same day, during a class period. We will do this together to ensure that we avoid conflicts.\n4. Tagging Problems Once you find a good query that allows you to locate all unchanged divs, you will need to add a comment in the very beginning of them to let others know the risk of using such bad sources. Here is an easy way to add comments to all of them instead of doing that manually.\nUsing the Share List part as an example, you can use //div[child::table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-shli01\u0026#34;]/row[1]/cell[3]/measure[contains(., \u0026#34;13 13/16\u0026#34;)]] in the Find/Replace in File tool to tell Oxygen to look at the div itself instead of the table inside the div.\nThen, you can use this query to find \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; in the div and replace it with \u0026lt;!-- incorrect value --\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;. Please remember to enable the regular expression. (See details in the image).\n5. Fixing proglems After you add a comment for individual divs, you can search you comment to find these divs and update them according to the page-images on our website, or using an alogrithm of your design.\n6.

The Egyptian Gazette contains a wealth of microhistorical data that can enrich the\n1. Identify a subject The first step is to find a Wikipedia page that needs your help. One way to get there is to use category pages, such as:\nEgyptian politician stubs (a stub is “an article deemed too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject”) People from Cairo Pashas If you are working on a person stub, you can search for that individuals in the Digital Egyptian Gazette content repository. Identify a news story that informs us of an important event in their lives, ideally something unaccounted for on the page. (Of course, you can also add the Gazette as a reference in support of information already given in Wikipedia.)\nYou might wish to work on an event or a place, or to create a new Wikipedia page for someone of significance. All of this is worthwhile work.\n2. Edit the page Sign up for Wikipedia and log in. Click “edit” near the top right of the page, and you will see the page’s text encoded in wikitext (Wikipedia’s syntax). It’s a simple language, not so different from Markdown, and there are lots of tips and tutorials available–here’s a good place to start. Proceed to add the necessary text to the page.\n3. Cite your source At the end of the information that you add, provide a reference to your source article in the Egyptian Gazette. Use this basic format (updated to reflect your source):\n\u0026lt;ref\u0026gt;{{cite news |author=\u0026lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--\u0026gt; |title=Personal and Social. |url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dig-eg-gaz/page-images/master/1906-page-images-4/1906-12-27-p3.jpg |work=The Egyptian Gazette |date=27 December 1906}}\u0026lt;/ref\u0026gt; (The url I’ve linked to is the page image of the article I’ve used.)\n4. Save your edit You will want to preview it first to check if the format is correct. You might also wish to watch the page, just in case someone removes your change–when this happens, it often happens in the first 24 hours.\n5. Let me know what you’ve edited The best way to do this is to send me the link to your “user contributions” page. My link looks like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Will_Hanley.\nAn example I found this mention of the funeral of the daughter of Joseph Cattaui in the “Personal and Social” section on page 3 of the December 27, 1906 issue.\nThis prominent businessman has his own Wikipedia page. It names some of his family members in the box on the right, but I’m not sure which daughter it is who died. I decided to add a new section mentioning this information about his private life. Here’s the code I used:\n==Personal life== Cattaui\u0026#39;s daughter died of typhoid fever at the age of 18 at the end of December, 1906.\u0026lt;ref\u0026gt;{{cite news |author=\u0026lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--\u0026gt; |title=Personal and Social. |url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dig-eg-gaz/page-images/master/1906-page-images-4/1906-12-27-p3.jpg |work=The Egyptian Gazette |date=27 December 1906}}\u0026lt;/ref\u0026gt; The edit is recorded in the page history here.\n","date":1587600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587600000,"objectID":"b6dfe032deaefb570b942689ad40b3ef","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/course-specific/wikipedia-instructions/","publishdate":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/course-specific/wikipedia-instructions/","section":"how-to","summary":"Much of the information that Wikipedia offers us about turn-of-the-century Egypt is derived from earlier, top-down sources (for example, the Encyclopedia Britannica of 1911).

Note: Library staff may offer you some help in using the microfilm readers, but they are not responsible to do the work for you. This tutorial explains everything you need to know to do this task.\n1. Setup Get film NP 486 for the appropriate month and year from the reserve desk in the basement in Strozier. You can sign it out for two hours. Each film contains three months’ worth of issues. You might have to scroll through a lot of film to find your date. Log on to one of the six microfilm-enabled computers, and open the “Microform PowerScan/PowerScan” program. Indicate that you are using microfilm or, if you are using PowerScan 2200, select the “Expert User + New Features” mode so you can change the resolution. Thread the film into the microfilm reader (a “ScanPro 1000/2200”), carefully following the threading route mapped on the table or the machine itself. Run a bit of film through the machine until you begin to see page images–the first foot of film is only black. Familiarize yourself with the controls at the bottom of the program. The “Motorized Roll Film Control” allows you to move through the film and find the issue you need. The toggle switch at the top moves the film slowly, and is useful to make exact adjustments. The larger “Adjust Image” menu has numerous controls. If your image is only displaying as half screen, click the “Film Orientation” button (or “Fill to Width” under the “Home” menu if you are using Powerscan 2200) and it will shift to full screen. You can play with the zoom until you see a whole page on the screen–you may have to move the carriage in the microfilm reader itself to center the image. You can focus, change the brightness, and so on, which will give you a more readable result. 2. Scan the page in quarters In order to produce a high-quality, OCR-ready image, it is necessary to scan the page in quarters, then stitch the image together. Zoom in on the image until the screen shows just the top left-hand quarter of the page, thus: Make sure that you leave a bit of overlap, so that the image stitching software can do its task. Change the shape of the green box, which shows the part of the image that you will save to a file, so that it contains the edges of the print. Make sure that the image is straight, balanced, and focused. Now you are ready to save it as an image file. Under the Scan/Print tab, change the scan resolution to 600dpi. Press “Scan to Drive #1.” Name your file following the standard dating format plus page number plus a suffix for the top left hand corner (YYYY-MM-DD-p1a). Choose file type jpg. Then proceed to scan the bottom left hand corner (p1b), the top right (p1c), and the bottom right (p1d). 3. Stitch the quarters Stitch the four quarters into a single high-resolution file using the Microsoft Image Composite Editor. The program is loaded on all of the scanning computers at Strozier. If you use a Windows computer, it is free to download for your own computer. When you open the program, click “New Panorama,” import the four quarter images you just produced, click “Stitch,” then click “Export.” Choose image quality “superb,” and save the file with the name “YYYY-MM-DD-p1.jpg”. This is the file that you will use for subsequent work–save it to your hard drive. Go ahead and do the same for all the pages of the issue. Note: You may find that certain pages (often page 1) are doubled on the microfilm. When this is the case, you only need scan one version of the doubled page. 4. Save your files Find the stitched image files you’ve created on the computer’s hard drive, and copy them to a USB key, save them to Dropbox, or save them some other way. Do not simply leave them on the microfilm computer. You do not need to save the quarter page images. Return the microfilm to the checkout desk–your classmates will need to find it. 5. Upload your images Each image file should be between 2MB and 10MB in size. If your files are larger than that, you will have to compress them. Once you are satisfied with your images, upload them directly to the appropriate subfolder within the page-images repository repository on GitHub. There are many subfolders (one for each quarter of each year). Make doubly sure before before you upload that your images are named exactly according to this format: YYYY-MM-DD-p1.jpg. Troubleshooting Sometimes the microfilm hardware fails to function. When this is the case, follow these instructions (courtesy Malcolm Shackelford of FSU libraries): Those MF machines are prone to fits, but the cure is nearly always to\nstop the microform viewing/scanning application. turn off the MF machine using the switch on the rear left detach and reattach the firewire cable from both the MF machine and the computer fire up the machine, then the scanning program Doing the above makes sure we don’t have a loose cable, and reminds Windows that the device is …","date":1475193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475193600,"objectID":"546b39f19e5c50091d6b2d94b655e30a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/digitization/microfilm-instructions/","publishdate":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/digitization/microfilm-instructions/","section":"how-to","summary":"Objective This tutorial explains how to produce high-quality, OCR-readable images from microfilm of a historical newspaper.

Create an xml file Copy and paste this template into a new document. Important: the new document will have \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; as its first line, and it’s also the first line of the template; delete one of them, otherwise your document will be ill-formed. Name this document using the date of the issue and an xml extension (YYYY-MM-DD.xml). (This document will eventually contain all of the pages of the issue, so it is not necessary to add the page number to the document name.) Save this document on your hard drive.\n3. Fill in the header Enter your name into the template (under \u0026lt;editor\u0026gt;), today’s date (under \u0026lt;edition\u0026gt;, in text and numeric formats), and the issue date (under \u0026lt;bibl\u0026gt;, in text and numeric formats).

First, you need to look in the advertisements directory to find templates that correspond to the ads that appear in your issue. Following the detailed indications here, copy the xml text of templates you need.\nYou must paste this text into the correct spot in the nameplate of your xml document. The two ads flanking the title take the form of \u0026lt;cell\u0026gt;s that go in the first \u0026lt;row\u0026gt; of the nameplate. The second \u0026lt;row\u0026gt; of the nameplate lists the number, date, and number of pages of the issue. Update this information.\nIf you switch to author mode (choose it from the text-grid-author buttons near the bottom of your screen), the whole nameplate should look something like this:\nNow switch back to text mode and proceed to work on the rest of the page. Find the text of the first ad in the first column after the nameplate, and paste it after the \u0026lt;cb n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; tag in the advertising section division. Proceed inserting ads all the way to the end of the third column.\n5. Make sure that your document is well-formed At the top right hand corner of your editing window in Oxygen, there is a square that will be either red or green. If it’s green, your document is well-formed, which means that it conforms to TEI XML standards and will be searchable and useable. If it’s red, the file contains errors that you must fix before you submit it. The errors appear as red lines on the right hand scrolling column.

As we produce our marked-up version of the newspaper, we can save effort by reusing templates in our own work. We must remain alert to minor variations, however.\n1. Identifying recurring features The first step is to determine if you are looking at something that is a template. Advertisements, tables, and other material that is not free text is probably templated. Check these indexes to see if you can find something identical or similar to what you want to find:\nThe complete catalog of advertisements is here. The complete catalog of financial tables and other boilerplates is here. These indexes contain images of the templated items, links to TEI-XML documents representing the templated item, and (sometimes) a comment or two about the template.\n2. Using templates Once you’ve identified the relevant template, you can paste its XML code into your own file. There are two ways to do this.\n2a. Using content completion boilerplates I’ve made a file that contains shortcuts to most of the boilerplates that you will need. (Note that it does not contain advertisements.) You can download it here. Once downloaded, you can install the file in Oxygen XML Editor by opening the Preferences dialog box (Options \u0026gt; Preferences), then going to Editor \u0026gt; Content Completion \u0026gt; Code Templates. Now click the Import button, and select the file you have downloaded.\nOnce you have installed the content completion boilerplates, you can press Control + Space, and a drop down menu of templates will appear. Choose the template you need and it will automatically appear where your cursor was.\nNext, customize the template content to match your issue’s content. Often there will be no changes. Sometimes dates, names, or numbers will have to be changed. Sometimes the changes will be more complex. As you become more familiar with TEI-XML, you will get better at customizing the template.\nNote that this content completion file will not be automatically updated. For the latest versions of boilerplates, consult the complete catalog, and follow the following procedure:\n2b. Copy and paste from xml file Once you’ve found the template you need, click the XML link. This will take you to a file in the dig-eg-gaz GitHub repository. Here you can copy the code you need to paste into your file.\nImportant: Only copy the material contained within the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; tags–the rest of the file should not appear in your issue file. To do so, select the text like this:\nPaste only this portion of the text into your issue document.\n3. What if there’s no template? If you can’t find a template that should be there, or if your version of an item is so different from the template that you think a new template is warranted, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, you can search the repository of already-encoded issues to see if someone has already produced a version of the material. If you find it, or if you feel up to encoding it yourself, you can turn this into a new template so that everyone can save time. Upload the xml and an image of the feature to the advertisements or boilerplates repository, and send a pull request. Finally, if you can’t find the material anywhere and it’s too involved to reproduce it yourself, file an issue at the advertisements or boilerplates repositories, insert a \u0026lt;!-- missing template --\u0026gt; comment with a few details into your document, and move on. 4. An overview of “features” from page to page and day to day For a general summary of recurring features, see the tables here. Every numbered page of the Gazette held similar material every day. The slides below offer an overview of the format over a typical week in July 1905. Page numbers are indicated on the bottom right. The main boilerplate is six pages long. On Wednesday and Saturday, when issues are eight pages, the extra pages are the fourth and fifth pages. Pages 6-8 of extended editions correspond to pages 4-6 of regular editions.\n","date":1568851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568851200,"objectID":"cc1be5c6d244ff035e620babde40252c","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/digitization/templating-instructions/","publishdate":"2019-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/digitization/templating-instructions/","section":"how-to","summary":"Objectives While features of the Egyptian Gazette were composed fresh each day, much of each issue consisted of templates reapplied with minor or no modifications from issue to issue.

This tutorial gives you instructions about how to submit your own work to our shared repositories.\n1. What is GitHub? GitHub is a tool to manage versioning and collaboration in coding projects large and small. It’s built on git software, and offers a bunch of useful social and communication tools in its user interface. Each of us will create an individual account where we’ll store and refine our work until it’s ready to upload to the dig-eg-gaz organization repositories.\n2. How to access GitHub You can approach GitHub three ways:\nusing a web browser to access github.com, using the GitHub Desktop client , or using the command line. We’ll be using the Desktop client mostly, but in a pinch you can use the web browser.\n3. How to use the organization repository and your own fork of it Navigate to the organization content repository, and fork the repository by clicking on the “fork” icon on the top right. You will be offered the chance to fork the repository under your own username–do so. This will make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. Clone this repository in your Desktop. In GitHub Desktop, right click the “content” repository, and choose “Show in Finder.” This will show where the content files you’ve just cloned are stored on your hard drive. Move your xml files here, and continue to edit and save them in this location. Desktop will help you to send these edits to Github. When you’re ready to sync your changes with the GitHub cloud, write a summary of your changes (e.g., “creating page 1”), hit “Commit to Master”, then hit “Fetch origin” (on the top right). This will backup your work onto your fork on GitHub’s servers. 4. How to submit your deliverables When your page files are complete, you can fold them from your own fork into the master organization content repository by sending me a pull request. You do this by navigating (on the github website) to your fork of the content repository. If it says “This branch is 1 commit ahead,” you can submit a pull request by clicking the “new pull request” button on the top left above your list of files. Follow the instructions and keep clicking until the pull request is submitted. I will then see the pull request and either merge your files into the organization’s content or request that you change something before doing so. If you want to check the status of your pull requests, scroll all the way to the top of the github web page. Click on “Pull requests” in white letters on a black background. You will then see a list of the pull requests you’ve submitted.\n5. How do I make sure that my content fork is up to date? In the screenshot above, you’ll notice the caption “This branch is 1 commit ahead, 98 commits behind dig-eg-gaz:master.” “Commits ahead” is work that you’ve done and will (or have already) submitted in a pull request. Once it’s merged into the master content repository, your fork will be “no commits ahead”.\n“Commits behind” represents work that your colleagues have done and that has been merged into the master content repository after you first made your fork. These updates don’t make their way into your fork automatically. Normally this is not big deal, as you aren’t working on those files anyway. But when it comes time to do your querying and analysis of the whole repository, it’s very important to make sure that you are working on an up-to-date version of the master content files.\nWhen you look at your fork of the dig-eg-gaz/content repository on the github website, you will see a line comparing your repository to the organization repository: If you are ahead, click the “new pull request” button above the status report and ask the organization to merge your changes.\nIf you are behind:\nclick “pull request” on the same line and to the right of the status of the report. You need to manipulate things so that your fork is the “base repository” and the dig-eg-gaz/content is the “head repository”. I’m not completely sure how to accomplish this… You will then be taken to a screen that allows you to create a pull request. Do so. This pull request will now appear on the “pull requests” tab of your fork of the content folder. Click on the tab, and on the pull request, and then merge the pull request. Your fork should now be up to date–the status line will confirm this. 6. Resources These Github tutorials might be useful:\nGithub flow: describes branch, commit, pull, etc. 5 minute read.

What is GitHub?","tags":null,"title":"GitHub instructions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objective This lesson explains how to turn images of text into editable files. We will use “optical character recognition” (OCR) to work with free text wherever we encounter it in the Egyptian Gazette. Once we’ve transformed OCRed text and performed basic corrections, it will be ready for TEI-XML markup.\nYou will not need to use OCR on text that has been templated. There are many OCR options. Each has strengths and weaknesses. I’ll outline a few choices below. I encourage you to experiment with a combination of approaches to see what works best with your particular week. Some issues are clearer than others, both in terms of the printing of the original newspaper itself and its transfer to microfilm. The quality of type varies, as does the white balance and background noise in the microfilm images. Always start with the clearest, straightest images you can produce.\nOption A: Google Drive Strengths:\nfree program that can be used without limit multi-language support continually updated and well-supported good OCR results handles line breaks and paragraph breaks well Weaknesses:\nrequires images to be cropped into single columns cumbersome upload process output can be over-formatted when pasted into author mode no configuration options Screen capture walk-through 1. Crop your page images into single columns It can be helpful to embed the column number into the image name. For example, you could call the image of column 1 of page 5 of the July 8, 1905 issue 1905-07-08-p5-c1.jpg.\n2. Upload the images to Google Drive 3. Convert the image file to Google Docs Right click on the image file within Google Drive, and open it with Google Docs.\nWait a moment, and a new file will appear containing your image and its text. You may want to correct any spelling mistakes that Google Docs identifies at this stage.\n4. Paste results into Oxygen’s author mode Whenever OCR produces formatted text (rather than plain text such as tesseract gives us), it is best to paste it using Oxygen XML Editor’s author mode (choose it from the text-grid-author buttons near the bottom of your screen). This means that paragraphs and other formatting will carry over into XML. When you switch back to text mode you will see them already marked up.\nPasting into author mode can create some odd div issues. Sometimes it is easiest to create an empty div in text mode, put your cursor inside it, then switch to author mode and paste the OCRed material. Normally it will appear in the right spot. Don’t neglect to go back to text mode and make sure everything looks okay.\nWhen you are pasting column by column from Google Drive conversion, it can be useful to use the \u0026lt;cb n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; tags to keep track of your place in the page.\nOption B: Tesseract Strengths:\nlots of configuration options free, open-source program that can be used without limit multi-language support continually updated and well-supported allows scanning of full page in one go plain text output can be cleaned easily Weaknesses:\nno graphic user interface (GUI) plain text output must be converted to XML can struggle with columns uneven quality no in-program correction interface 1. Set up Tesseract Tesseract is an open-source OCR program supported by Google. It is the engine behind text recognition in Google docs, Google image search, and many other Orwellian applications.\nWe will be running it on the hard drives of our own laptops. Unlike most programs you will have used, tesseract does not have a graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, you run it from the command line. The command line interface can take a bit of getting used to, but it is relatively straightforward. Also, once you know how to use the command line it’s easier to look under the hood of your computer when you need to.\n1a. Access the command line You need to open a program in order to access the command line.\nOSX: The command line program is Terminal. You can find it in Applications \u0026gt; Utilities. Windows: If you’re using Windows, click Start, then in the Search or Run line, type cmd (short for command), and press enter. The program you open will look something like this:\nWhen you open this program, you will face a plain black box which offers you no hints or help. But don’t worry! These instructions will walk you through the steps you need for this task, and any search engine will quickly tell you how to do anything else you need.\n1b. Install Tesseract Installation for OSX Install Homebrew (a “package manager”) by pasting /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026#34; in the command line, pressing enter, and following the prompts. Then, install tesseract by running brew install tesseract in the terminal. You’ll also want to add French language support: run brew install tesseract-lang. Installation for Windows Download this program (compiled by generous folks at the University of Mannheim). Run it, which will install Tesseract-OCR, which will be listed under the start menu.

Fix the basic structural tags Now correct and add basic structural tags of three types:\n\u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt;, which you can use for articles, items, or any division of the page that makes sense to you, \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;, which indicates a headline (the headline must be the first element in the item), \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;, which indicates a paragraph. Oxygen offers many shortcuts to make this work go faster. Highlight the text you wish to wrap, then hit command-E. You will be offered a menu of tags. Choose the one you want. If you want to add more tags of the same type, hit command-slash.\nOnce you add these tags to your page, you might have a valid document (and thus a green box in Oxygen). But these common errors will probably also have to be addressed:\n\u0026amp;: the ampersand is represented as \u0026amp;amp; in xml. \u0026amp; alone will create an error. \u0026gt; or \u0026lt;: the OCR process produces stray angle brackets. The editor thinks these are part of a xml tag, and it causes an error. anything else not in a \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, and not in a \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; or a \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;. 2. Add feature attributes There are many recurring sections that show up issue after issue: local news, international news, sports, and many more. These should be marked \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;\u0026gt; rather than \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt;. It is important to mark these using the feature attribute, so that we can find them in XPath searches. The complete list of features is here. To add an feature attribute, place it within the \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag, after the type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34; attribute, thus: \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34; feature=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;\u0026gt;. If you type feature inside the tag, Oxygen should offer you an autocomplete menu of features.\n3. Add more complex structural tags There are more tags that you can add:\nIf the article or item is in French, add the attribute xml:lang=\u0026#34;fr\u0026#34; to the \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag. \u0026lt;cb/\u0026gt; for column breaks. Be sure to put this tag at the beginning of the column. Add the number of the column, as well, thus: \u0026lt;cb n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; For mixed columns, see this guidance. \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;\u0026gt; to wrap multiple items that belong together, for instance in the international or local news sections. \u0026lt;dateline\u0026gt; for datelines. There can only be one dateline per division. In the international news section, this means that you must make a new \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; for each newswire report. \u0026lt;byline\u0026gt; for authors. There can only be one byline per division. \u0026lt;gap/\u0026gt; for holes in the text, \u0026lt;unclear\u0026gt; for illegible text (you can supply an attribute explaining why), and \u0026lt;supplied\u0026gt; for something that was illegible but which you figured out by finding the same thing in a different issue. pieces of articles that are continuous texts broken up by ads or between issues should be connected using xml:id and the next and prev elements, thus: if the articles are in the same issue, make their tags \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; xml:id=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34; next=\u0026#34;item2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; xml:id=\u0026#34;item2\u0026#34; prev=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;. If the articles are in different issues, make their tags \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; xml:id=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34; next=\u0026#34;YYYY-MM-DD.xml#item2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; xml:id=\u0026#34;item2\u0026#34; prev=\u0026#34;YYYY-MM-DD.xml#item1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;. the \u0026lt;figure\u0026gt; element will be useful for the Egyptian Gazette, but I have not yet worked out how to use it. 4.

Get the page hierarchy right The best way to get a quick idea of your file’s structure is to look at the Outline in Oxyge. At the highest level, your document should consist of six (or eight) parallel page \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;s:\nAll other \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;s should be inside the page \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; in which they appear. If you do not have everything inside pages, your outline will look messy:\nThe solution is to drag everything into its proper page.\nAnother problem that arises is failing to close divs or pages. You’ll know you have this problem if the end of your file looks like this:\n2. Get the breaks right There are three types of “breaks” in the digital Egyptian Gazette. All are indicated using single tags, rather than pairs: unlike paragraph tags, for example, which must open (\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;) and close (\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;), break tags come alone. They include a “slash” just before the closing bracket to show that they have no partner: \u0026lt;lb/\u0026gt;.\nTwo of the break tags are quite straightforward to work with:\na. Line breaks You will have little need for line breaks, which are coded \u0026lt;lb/\u0026gt;. For the most part, line breaks are indicated with paragraph tags. Sometimes, however (in adverts, for instance), you may find it useful or necessary to use a \u0026lt;lb/\u0026gt; instead of \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;.\nb. Page breaks Page breaks (\u0026lt;pb n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;) are currently used in the digital Egyptian Gazette, but they are redundant, because every page is contained in \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34; n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; tags. In both cases, the n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34; attribute records the page number.\nPlease use both divs and breaks to indicate pages. TEI’s rules for periodicals are still in development, and we want our resource to be flexible to more than one approach. Note that the page break tag comes before the page \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; itself; the arrangement outlined in the first page hierarchy image above is correct.\n3. Column breaks Column breaks can be hard to work out, not least because they are not well implemented in the TEI specification. In this project, we use three different tags to describe the columns:\na. \u0026lt;cb n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; This tag indicates the start of a new column. Use it at the beginning of every page, and again each time the text stops at the bottom of the page and jumps to the top of another column. Use the n= attribute to indicate which column is beginning.\nThis is straightforward on a typical page 3, which contains six even-sized columns running from the top to the bottom of the page.\nDo not make each column into its own \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;. Column breaks often coincide with the start of a new \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, but they have a distinct role. They indicate the layout of the paper, not its content. \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, on the other hand, is used to encode articles and sections of the paper with their own headline and content. A \u0026lt;cb/\u0026gt; can even be dropped in the middle of a paragraph, as we see with the column break at the start of column 5 in the image above.\nb. \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; This tag indicates how many evenly-sized columns the page is divided into. Use it only when the width of columns change. Below the nameplate on page 1, for example, we use a \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; tag to show that the page is divided into three equal columns. We insert this tag before we show the start of the first column using \u0026lt;cb n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;.\nPage 3 is usually divided into six equal columns. We can indicate this using \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;6\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;. Again, this tag comes before the first column break (as indicated in the image above).\nThings are more complicated on page 2, which often contains a mix of single- and double-width columns. Remember that single-width columns are indicated with \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;6\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;, because the page can contain six of them. Double-width colums are indicated with \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;, because the page can contain only three of them. The rare triple-width column would be marked with \u0026lt;cols n=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;.\nHere is an example of a page 2, with its layout blocked in colored columns:\nThe page starts with a double-width column (A), which splits into two single-width columns (A \u0026amp; B) partway down. The middle of the page contains another double-width column ( C ) that splits into single-width columns (C \u0026amp; D). The right-hand side of the page contains two full-length single-width columns (E \u0026amp; F).\nWe encode the columns on this page like this:\nc. \u0026lt;colSpan n=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; You will rarely need to use this tag.

Plain text can be searched with keywords, but TEI-XML encoded text can be searched in more precise ways. For example, if you search for “London” in plain text, you would find hundreds and hundreds of repeated references to London in ads and tables. TEI-XML allows you to search for “London” in specific parts of the newspaper: page 3, for example, or local news. Restricting your search to these locations can give you more useful results.\nThe two main query (search) languages for XML are XPath and XQuery. This tutorial focuses on XPath as used in the Oxygen XML editor. An XPath is a series of terms (words) separated by slashes (/) and other punctuation that describes a specific location or locations in an XML file. For example, the XPath //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;cotton\u0026#39;)] describes paragraphs containing the word “cotton” that are contained in any div that is itself contained in a div that is defined as a section. This tutorial explains how to use this powerful tool.\n1. Setting up queries in the Oxygen XML editor Oxygen XML Editor allows you to run queries in several different ways. For our purposes, the most useful are a) Find and Replace and b) the XPath query bar\nA) Find and Replace If you are searching for a specific word or phrase, or searching using regular expressions, it’s easiest to use Find and Replace. You can search for the word everywhere in a file, or in specific parts of that file, by restricting the search to a certain XPath.\nSearching a single file Open the file that you wish to search in the Oxygen XML editor. Then, click on Find/Replace (the magnifying glass). This will allow you to search for a keyword in the open file. The results will be displayed at the bottom of the editor. Click on any item in this list to be taken to that location in your file.\nAs an example, search for Egypt. Then, search for Egypt, but restrict your XPath to div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;], which will restrict your search to page 3 only. Copmpare the results of these two searches.\nSearching several files Open all of the files that you wish to search, then click on Find/Replace in Files: This will open a dialogue box. Under “Scope,” choose “All opened files,” then proceed with your search.\nSearching the full contents of the digital Egyptian Gazette To search everything in the Digital Egyptian Gazette content repository, under Find/Replace in Files \u0026gt; Scope, choose “Specified path,” then navigate to the location where you’ve cloned your fork of the content repository. For more information about how to find this location, consult the Github tutorial.\nB) XPath query bar If you are searching for particular nodes rather than words, or counting nodes, it’s easiest to use the XPath query bar, which is located near the top left of your screen.\nThe drop-down icon on the left of this box allows you to choose the scope of your search: current file, all opened files, and other options. To search the full contents of the digital Egyptian Gazette, you’ll need to use a “working set.”\nSet up a working set To create a working set of files for your search, click on “Configure XPath working sets…” in the drop down menu pictured above. Create a “New working set”, give it a name, then press enter. Now click “Add resources,” then “Folders,” then select the content folder you’ve cloned from GitHub. Click “Done” and “Ok”, and you should be ready to query the full contents.\nBasic XPath queries Set the scope to “Current File,” then try these basic queries:\n//div returns a list of all the “divs” in your file //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;] returns a list of all the item-type divs in your file //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;cotton\u0026#39;)] returns a list of all the item-type divs in your file containing the word “cotton” 2. The What and Where of XPath Once you have the basic parameters set up, it’s time to look a bit more carefully at the logic of XPath. XPath asks you to do two things: specify where you want to search, and specify what you want to search for.\n“Where” searches We use XML to structure our issues of the Egyptian Gazette by page, section, item, and so on. For example, we use nesting pairs of tags to put \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; inside \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; inside \u0026lt;div type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;.\nThis structure is commonly described as a “tree.” The root is the issue, which branches into six or eight pages, and each page branches into sections and items and paragraphs.\nAn XPath query shows the tree parts separated by slashes, starting from root and heading towards the branches, like so:\n//div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]/div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/p\nA double slash (//) tells the computer to look anywhere in the document for the item that comes next. A single slash (/) tells the computer to look only one level up the tree. What difference does this make?\n//div//head would return any headline in any div in the whole document.

Download Tableau and follow installation instructions.\nAfter downloading and installing the software, you can follow video tutorials to get up to speed with more advanced functions. But for now, let’s look at some simple examples using data from the digital Egyptian Gazette.\nWalkthrough First, let’s gather data to explore in Tableau. This data comes from the Coton table, which appears regularly in the financial news section of the Egyptian Gazette.\nUsing this query: //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-cotn01\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#39;balles\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1], returns the number of bales of cotton exported. Right click on the results and save to a temporary file.\nWe will want to do more than just explore total cotton exports so let’s also run this query://table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-cotn01\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#39;Angleterre\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1], along with France, Russie, Autriche, Italie, Allemagne, Espagne, and other countries to acquire the cotton export numbers to each respective destination.\nThe resulting data from each of these queries will be quite raw. We can use Regular Expressions to clean up our data before putting it into Tableau.\nThe spreadsheet we create from these results should contain the following variables: Month, Country, and Total Cotton Export (Bales). You can download a sample spreadsheet containing these data.\nNow that we have data representing monthly total cotton exports and where they are being shipped we want to visualize this data.\nOpen Tableau, and click “Connect to a File” in the upper left corner, and select the spreadsheet from your hard drive.\nMake sure that Tableau is recognizing the data types in your spreadsheet (dates, country names, numbers, etc). While in the Data Source interface, change the “Month” column from string to date value by Clicking on the “Abc” icon and selecting “Date” from the drop down menu. Set the “Country” column’s geographic role to “Country/Region”.\nAt the bottom, click Sheet 1. After dragging and dropping the “Total Cotton Export (Bales)” cell in the row slot, place the “Month” cell in the column slot, under Marks select “Bar”.\nThe resulting visual gives us an annual total of exports, but we can go deeper.\nIn the column slot, click the “Date” cell and select “Month”. This provides a clearer representation of fluctuations in the cotton export value during the year. In the “Marks” box select “Label”, and click the box next to “Show Mark Labels”. Now our data is effectively communicating the monthly totals of cotton exports. Now let’s incorporate each destination to further increase the accuracy of the data.\nDrag and drop the “Country” cell into the Color box. Now we can see that a majority of the cotton exported every month was shipped to England.\nFor a simpler comparative drag and drop the “Country” cell into the Filters box, click none, then select which countries you want to compare. For now let’s look at the difference between cotton exports to England and France. .\nTo create a different kind of visualization clear the Columns and Rows then drag and drop the “Country” cell into the Columns slot and “Total Cotton Export” into the Rows slot. (You may need to remove the filter to display all countries). On the right hand side of the interface click “Show Me”, and select the Symbol Map option. The resulting image depicts the amount of comparative cotton exported to each location. To save our visualizations, click “Story”, “New Story”. Drag the desired sheet to the designated location. Click “Story”, “Export Image”. Conclusion Tableau is great for creating visualisations from your data, but it also is useful for data exploration. When we create data visualisations it is important to remember to keep graphics simple and self-explanatory. For independent data exploration, however, we can try simple as well as complex approaches. Experiment with your data in the software to not only create graphics, but to see how different visualisations help you think about your research.\n","date":1490659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490659200,"objectID":"01d289586e0d4ed06cebb3898ef1dc2a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/digitization/visualization-instructions/","publishdate":"2017-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/how-to/digitization/visualization-instructions/","section":"how-to","summary":"Tableau is a powerful tool that can be used to view, manipulate, explore, and analyze data.

It was a central location for travelers, migrants, colonialists, and natives, and despite the many different backgrounds and origins of the people who populated Egypt, one trait remained constant: a desire to be entertained. Entertainment was found in Egypt in a variety of denominations, including theater, steamboat trips, and sporting events. Sporting events in particular had significant cultural influence in Egypt, serving as entertainment for the local populations as well as a shared interest among both local and colonialist inhabitants. The mention of sports throughout the Egyptian Gazette reflects the interests of the newspaper’s readers as well as providing insight into the ever-changing daily lives of the residents of Egypt. Perhaps more importantly, they present patterns through longevity that reflect how sports as a means of entertainment interact with other outlets of life in early 20th century Egypt.\nIn order to draw any conclusions about sports in the Egyptian Gazette, a comprehensive metric for identifying where sports are mentioned first had to be established. After many readings of Egyptian Gazette articles, as well as external research, it became apparent that the most common sports being played and documented in the newspaper at the time were aquatic sports, horseback riding, football (soccer), and cricket. In order to find instances of these in the existing Digital Egyptian Gazette database, a simple X-Path Query was constructed, starting by searching for football. More specifically, using the “matches” feature when searching for a div within a div. The query appears as follows: “//div//div[matches(., ‘football’, ‘i’)]”. This returned all of the instances of the word “football” within the Egyptian Gazette. A similar approach was taken for the remaining sports, with the queries for “aqua sports” and “horseback riding” simply using two “matches” statements to ensure the most comprehensive results were returned. Hence, the horseback riding query appeared as: //div//div[matches(., \u0026#39;horse\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][matches(., \u0026#39;riding\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] and the aqua sports query appeared as //div//div[matches(., \u0026#39;aqua\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][matches(., \u0026#39;sports’, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]. It is important to note that neither the words “aquatic” nor “horseback” were included in full. Rather, “horse” and “aqua” are used in the queries as a more inclusive search term that is likely to return more results. The final query utilized was for cricket, arguably the most popular sport of the time. In this query, however, the type “wire” was excluded to void all mentions of cricket games occurring in England that were telegraphed to Egypt and written about in the newspaper. Therefore, the query for mentions of cricket in the Egyptian Gazette appeared like this: //div//div[matches(., \u0026#39;cricket\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][not(@type=\u0026#34;wire\u0026#34;)]. The term “wire” does not need to be excluded from other queries, as cricket had disproportionately more mentions in telegraphs relative to other sports, which had practically none.\nAfter receiving the total number of instances in which these four different sports were mentioned throughout the Egyptian Gazette database, it was almost time to visualize the results. However, the goal of this study was to draw a more longitudinal analysis of sports over time. The best way to do this was to count the total monthly mentions of each sport, regardless of the quantity of times it is mentioned in one issue or the year that the issue was published. This metric would provide a dataset that shows the monthly popularity of each sport, as sports are known for being both seasonal occurrences that result in fluctuating popularity. So, using a simple C++ algorithm written in Visual Studio Code, the number of “repeat mentions” for any sport was subtracted from the total monthly sums of mentions of that same sport, void of year.

In order to tackle this issue, we devised a methodology to test the relevance of the queries used in our individual analysis. For future research projects, I have outlined the basic process below:\nGather relevant keywords to your research question. Try to get a list of at least 5 or so words that are concise enough to yield relevant results, but not too little. Run count queries for those words and keep track of how many results you get for each. If you can, look at some of the results, and see if there are any “stock words” that you can use to exclude in subsequent queries. Run more queries with narrower parameters and keep track of how many results are yielded. Make sure to exclude stock words. Divide the number of narrow queries by the more generalized result and calculate the percentage. With these percentages, you can now tell how relevant your specifications are, in regard to your larger research question. If some queries are only 2% of the larger data pool, that would likely be not as significant compared to a query of 38%. Interpreting this data and incorporating it into your individual analysis can be done however you choose. The overall purpose of this method is to provide a quick way to clarify and measure the relevancy of potential queries you may have for your project. Seeing how correlated your queries are to larger ideas and phrases that are present in the Egyptian gazette can help gather a more concise data pool to draw on for your analysis.\nWhat we were trying to accomplish (as a group and as an individual) The purpose of this was to determine how effective a certain query was at returning results relevant to what was being researched. A lot of our initial queries returned hundreds of results, but only a certain percentage of those results contained any relevant information. Furthermore, there was often a pattern in the initial query’s results that allowed for the exclusion or inclusion of certain words or terms to help narrow things down. Because of this, we used the method of refining our initial queries and calculated a percentage to determine the relevance of the results produced.\nOne example of this was a query used to find associations with the word “pain” in the paper. The initial query returned 585 results with only 244 of those results being relevant. The other 341 results contained information irrelevant to what was being sought after. This means that the initial query was about 41.7% successful at returning relevant results. Obviously, there is room for improvement. Interestingly, about 31.6% of the results from the initial query contained the word “painting”. Clearly, these results were not relevant to what was being sought after, so by running the query again but excluding the word “painting” this time, the results proved to be far more relevant. This time, 61% of the results contained relevant information. This is about a 20% difference between the two queries, meaning that, now, most of the results contain relevant information.\nAnother example was finding specific words associated with “ivory”. While Ivory itself gave 233 results, divs containing “packages ivory” came to 60 results, or roughly a quarter of all instances of Ivory. Searching for divs that contained both the words “ivory” and “tusk” gave only 12 results (5% of all results) , which meant that there was far less results to use in my analysis. By having these numbers available, I knew how I wanted to guide my research, and was able to use the 12 results for a more in-depth analysis, while packages of ivory could give raw data in discussing the context in which animals were viewed in the Egyptian gazette.\nThis example shows queries to find sections that included words associated with the Assouan Dam. This was a bit more complex as the keyword is two different words. This required the query to add sections that would include “Assouan Dam” or (“Assouan” and “Dam”) together. There were 96 initial results for “Assouan Dam” and 263 counts of “Assouan” and “Dam” not including “Assouan Dam”. This was a total of 359 results, with 114 being relevant. This shows that 32.6% of results were relevant. There were a lot of irrelevant results caused by the word “Dam”. For instance, this brought up information related to “Damascus” or “Rotterdam”. The query search was updated to look for “Assouan” and “ Dam “. This included a space before and after “dam” so that it would search for whole words only. This created a total of 117 results, meaning only 3 results were not relevant. This query resulted in a 97.4% relevant return.\nThis graph compiled all our relevancy trends into one chart, where ivory was in red, pain in teal, assouan dam in blue and Ryan’s in orange.

Our topics were theaters, murder, and sports. When analyzing the similarities or how related they might be, we found that both theaters and sports were a source of entertainment, but the relationship between entertainment and murder was quite unclear. That is when we decided we had to go beyond our topics, and find something else that could benefit us all. So, after digging a bit deeper, we found that we could work on a query that could work for all of us by making a part of it easily substitutable. We also realized that something that we could focus on could be places. Location was something that could add significantly to our projects, especially since we could explore the relationship between locations that were hotspots for events in the Egyptian Gazette and locations that could be significant to our individual projects.\nTo find the most mentioned locations in the Gazette, we had to develop a search that would actually find the greatest number of locations. Since the place name tag isn’t used very often, we had to take another approach to accurately find locations. To do this, we first developed a set of phrases that often came before a location name, so that we could search for those and ideally the place names would follow. We chose to use the following terms: in, near, to, at, and by. There were other terms, such as “from” that often preceded place names, but those had more to do with shipping and advertisements and less to do with events occurring in these places like we were looking for. Using those phrases, we created the following regular expression search: (in|near|to|at|by) [A-Z]\\w+\nThis would effectively search for any of our key phrases that were followed by a space, capital letter (since place names are capitalized) and the rest of that word. The space between the set of parentheses and brackets was crucial, because otherwise the search would return words that start with in or at, such as “into” or “attention.”\nWhile that regular expression search was mostly effective, there were too many results to reasonably work with, so we had to refine our search in some way. We chose to exclude advertisements, because while advertisements often mentioned place names, they weren’t actually recording events happening. Most advertisements containing locations were talking about shipping or traveling, which we felt would skew the results towards these port cities and away from other centers of local activity. So, in our search, we added “restrict to XPath” with the following query: //div[not(@n=”1”)]//div[not(@type=”advert”)]. This would eliminate the entire first page of the Gazette from our results, which was full of ads, as well as any additional advertisements that contained the div type “advert.”\nOnce we had our results from this search, we copied them into Sublime Text to simplify them down to only the place name. We then put that list into Voyant Tools, where it ranked the words based on how often they were mentioned. Most words were place names, but there were a few that weren’t quite relevant, such as “mr.” We then went through that list manually to find the top ten Egyptian cities mentioned, as well as the top ten cities overall.\nWhen looking at the most mentioned place names, we noticed that while Alexandria and Cairo were pretty common, the majority of our findings represented cities and countries outside of Egypt. This data suggests that international affairs are pretty popular or relevant to the Egyptian Gazette and its readers. While it is not something that we queried for, we do know that this is true, since when coding the issues, we encounter a lot of information on shipping, steamers, and movement of people. These recurrent topics are seen in recurrent features of the Gazette, such as Steamer Movements, Shipping Movements, and Movement Maritime. European countries specifically are also prevalent in the datelines of letters and telegrams, with a lot of communication coming from major cities like London and Paris.\nFor the visualization we decided to use Tableau, since it opens the possibility for a more interactive representation. We geolocated each of the cities in our table (seen above) and graphed them into a map.

As a dancer, the cultural and artistic elements of different parts of the world and times have always interested me, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn more. At first, I wanted to explore which theatres were more prevalent in the Gazette, but as I explored previous projects, I realized that it was already done and that I had to focus on fixing the issues that I saw with other projects and use the corrections to be able to say more with the data available.\nThe main issue that I saw with works preceding mine was that the x-paths followed, and queries performed were focused on the Calendar of coming events. While that is a good approach, considering that this is the place we would find the most information about events happening at the theatres, we also have to take into consideration flaws in our database. Looking exclusively on data tagged with the Calendar of Coming Events feature (@ComingEvents) would be a good search if we knew all instances of the Calendar of Coming Events were tagged with said feature and encoded in the same format.\nTo verify that my statement is correct, I searched for Calendar of Coming Events by name and by feature and compared them with the number of issues encoded. To calculate the number of features encoded I used the X-Path //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]. Since these tags are included in the template with which we create and encode our files, every file has page 1 encoded and tagged this way. Looking for page 1 will therefore give me the number of issues encoded and uploaded to the repository, which are 956 issues. Using the X-Path //div[@feature=\u0026#34;comingEvents\u0026#34;] I counted the number of issues that have the section tagged with the respective feature, and I found out that only 609 issues have the Calendar of Coming events tagged with the feature tag. When looking for Calendar of Coming Events using a regular expression, I found 635 mentions of it, proving my point of the flaws in the encoding of the database.\nBecause of that issue, I decided that my queries would not be focused on the feature for the Calendar of Coming Events. To start my project, I wanted a list of theatres to focus on. To find this list, I used the regex \\w+ [A-Z]\\w+ Theatre. Since not all of the results were useful, I cleaned up the results in Sublime text, and counted the instances in Microsoft Excel, to rank the theatres from most to least mentioned, and therefore find which theatres I should focus on.\nTheatre Count Zizinia Theatre 509 Alhambra Theatre 114 San Stefano Theatre 54 Abbas Helmy Theatre 49 Esbekieh Theatre 34 Verdi Theatre 26 Knowing the the feature @comingEvents was not reliable, I found an alternative way to format my searches. Since the performances are indeed listed in the Calendar of Coming Events but the feature is coded differently per issue, I used the X-path //div[contains(., \u0026#39;Calendar of Coming Events\u0026#39;)]/p[contains(., \u0026#39;Zizinia Theatre\u0026#39;)], To find paragraphs that included Zizinia Theatre in divs that contained Calendar of Coming Events. I would have made my x-path look for the Coming Events headline specifically instead of just anywhere in the div that contained the words, but I noticed that not all of the issues had the title formatted as a headline. After cleaning up the results to include only the date (issue) that included the mention, and the actual performance or show, I copied and pasted the results into an excel sheet and proceeded to follow the same steps for the other theatres, substituting the theatre name in the x-path.\nOnce I had all the results for the different theatres, I created two tables. For both I included date of mention, theatre name, and type of presentation or form of entertainment. The difference between the two is how detailed I was when categorizing the types of entertainments. For the first one, I tried to be as specific as I could be, so the results could be compared, for example, between two really similar categories, like French Opera vs Italian Opera. For the second table, I grouped like categories into one, to make the graph easier to understand and for it to need a bit less effort to read, since there are less categories.\nFigure 1:\nFor figure 1, I used the single count dates (day/month/year) as columns, the type of event features as rows, and represented the different theatres with different colors in the representation. Due to its shorter height, this representation does an excellent job highlighting which events were happening around the same time, and in which theatres too. For example, January 1907 shows an opera in Zizinia Theatre, a Performance in Alhambra, and a play in the Esbekieh Gardens Theatre happening in the same week. This is also the case of July 1906, where we see a Ball and a Concert at San Stefano, and a comedy at Alhambra theatre.

With these changing times, the relation between humans and animals changed too, as various exotic creatures were exploited for commercial, entertainment, or recreational purposes. I started by noticing frequent mentions of ivory sales throughout the gazette, which drew me first to reading about elephants. One common way in elephants were used was for harvesting Ivory. Despite there being laws put in place to limit the number of elephants being killed for their tusks, sale of both legal and contraband ivory was still frequent, as shown in select articles throughout the gazette. While reading through the gazette, there were also multiple instances of elephants, tigers, lions, and other animals being mentioned, as well as the context in which they were brought up. Through researching this, a better idea of how animals were viewed in the context of empire, namely in Egypt, can be better understood, and give us insight to how society viewed animals as a resource at the time. My main question in conducting this analysis was “how were animals viewed in the early 20th century?”. In order to find an answer to this question, I looked at the Egyptian Gazette, along with other supplementary materials to gain a better idea of To begin my research, a quick look at the frequency of animal mentions was made. Below is a chart listing the most frequent words that yielded results related to animals. While the words in the graph may not seem wholly connected, these were the most frequent ways in which animals were mentioned, that also included relevant information to my analysis project.\nKey word Number of Mentions Ivory 233 Elephant 64 Zoo 21 Giraffe 15 Hunting 5 Safari 4 From this table alone, we see that ivory sale was the primary way in which, of these three topics, animals were discussed within the gazette. It is important to note that I excluded the search for “Hunting” on its own, as there are many advertisements for hunting and fishing equipment, which is in of itself a different piece of the gazette to be analyzed. With this information, I then ran a series of queries that narrowed down my results from the broad “ivory” category. Two examples of my queries were //p[contains(., \u0026#39;packages ivory\u0026#39;)] and //div//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;ivory\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][matches(., \u0026#39;tusks\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]. When I gathered my results from these queries, I divided the number of results yielded by the total number of instances of “ivory”, in order to get a clearer idea of how much these specifications narrowed down my results. The phrase “packages ivory” made up a startling 25.75% of all results, while ivory and tusks only made up 5%.\nThis visualization was made in Tableau, as it allows Through these results, it becomes clear that elephants were seen as almost a separate entity from the ivory they yielded. The body part that yielded ivory (tusks) was rarely seen associated with ivory and its sale, while packages of ivory, whether in shipping or in the market, was mentioned more frequently. There was also a spike in mentions of the Ordinance for Preservation of Wild Animals and Birds (enacted 1903) during issues in 1906, which also saw a sharp decrease in mentions of “packages ivory”. There was little association between the animal itself and all mentions of ivory, largely due to the commercial nature of the articles featuring ivory (most being the Sale of Ivory and Rubber news feature). Ostrich feathers were another way in which animals were sought out for their material goods, and this trade worked its way through Egypt to be exported to London. While harvesting of these feathers eventually became non-lethal for the animal, it serves as another example of how animals were exploited for commercial and luxury reasons. When searching through the articles, I came across a few that discussed owning exotic animals as pets, which was quite interesting. One article had Sudan giraffes for sale, listed as a “fine pair, male and female”. Other articles discussed the Sultan’s own collection of animals, or news regarding new animals being shipped in for Cairo’s Zoological Gardens, one instance of which I’ve outlined below.\n“We hear that Capt. Flower Bey is on his way back from the Sudan with a collection of nearly 200 living animals for the Cairo Zoological Gardens, including two elephants, several lions, and a great number of antelopes of various species.”\nThe shipment of new animals to the Cairo Zoological Gardens was noteworthy enough to be mentioned in the gazette, and exotic African animals are the main ones listed in these types of articles. Other mentions of Captain Flower in the gazette list more types of animals gathered, all along the Nile river. Along with the acquisition of animals, there is frequent mention of hunting, largely in the form of the Thomas \u0026amp; Son’s tailoring company, which offers custom …","date":1702425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702425600,"objectID":"d6e6f73a39847fb04d12f2597b8f47b5","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-lubinski/","publishdate":"2023-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-analysis-lubinski/","section":"post","summary":"The importance of animals in 20th century Egypt","tags":[],"title":"Elephants and Empire","type":"post"},{"authors":["Harper West"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"For my analysis project, I wanted to observe how murder was reported in the Egyptian Gazette. To gauge whether or not this was a feasible topic within the Gazette, I began with the simple query: //p[contains(., ‘murder’)]/text().\nThis enabled me to find all of the paragraphs containing the word “murder,” as well as surrounding text to gather some more details from the search. This search yielded about 800 items, so it was clear that murder was present enough in the Gazette to do some research with. This query was appropriate for a rough estimate of murder in the Gazette, but not much else. Since it looks for a paragraph containing the word murder, it can actually count the same case of murder multiple times if it is mentioned throughout several paragraphs. I knew that I had to get more specific with my topic, but finding that murder was at least relatively relevant within the Gazette was a good start.\nFinalizing a Topic After the initial stage of my project, I considered more deeply what exactly about murder that I wanted to focus on. I decided on an approach that would use murder as a measure of how reputable the Egyptian Gazette was for news. To do so, I would first evaluate the Gazette’s colonial bias against Egyptians (referred to as “natives”) by seeing if there was any difference in the reporting of native murders compared to non-native murders. The second criteria which I would use to evaluate the Gazette would involve comparing the number of recorded murders per year to the number of actual murders per year, as provided by the Egyptian Consul General papers.\nMore Querying To begin these queries, I had to first determine what vocabulary would be most effective for searching. While the word “murder” had come to mind first, other words such as “homicide” and various forms of “kill” were used to describe these events. To evaluate which term was the most frequently used, I searched the following: count(//div[contains(.,’murder’)])\nWhere the word “murder” is would be interchanged for both kill and homicide to count the instances of these words. After a search of all three terms I found that murder returned 88 divs, kill returned 406 divs, and homicide returned zero divs. While it seemed that forms of the word kill were most prevalent, I read through about twenty of the results, and they were nowhere near as relevant as those that the term “murder” had returned. Most of the divs containing some form of kill either contained “murder” elsewhere in the paragraph (if it was describing a murder) or were more relevant to war. Since instances of war and other killings in non-murderous contexts (more common than it may seem) were far too common with the search including the word kill, I decided to stick with my original search of the term murder.\nTo find the instances of native murders, I wanted to ensure I was using the correct vocabulary for that search as well. I had seen native and Arab most commonly used within the paper to refer to the Egyptians, so I decided to see if “Arab,” “native,” or “Egyptian” would yield the most results. For this to be relevant within the context of my project, I searched the instances of these words occurring in the same paragraph with the word murder. The query is as follows: //div//p[matches(.,\u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][matches(.,\u0026#39;native\u0026#39;)]\nWhere the word “native” is was interchanged with the other two words. Within paragraphs that contained “murder,” “native” appeared to be the most frequently occurring of these terms.\nNow that I had a query that effectively found all of the instances of murder involving a native, I copied the results into Sublime Text and shaved them down to the date and the relevant text. I then went through all of the results and put them into an Excel sheet, noting the date of the report, who (as in what nationality) was murdered, who was responsible for the murder, and where the murder occurred. Some of the results were eliminated because they were regarding attempted murder, war, or lacked necessary information.\nAfter identifying all of the cases of murder in which Egyptians were either the victim, perpetrator, or both, I needed a way to identify all of the other murders in the Gazette. After some tries, I reached the following query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]/div[not(@feature=\u0026#34;wire\u0026#34;)]//p[matches(.,\u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;) and not(matches(.,\u0026#39;native\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;))]\nWhile not perfect, this query is able to find paragraphs containing murder that do not also contain the term native. In an attempt to hopefully eliminate news from other countries, I excluded divs with the feature “wire,” because I was noticing lots of telegrams reporting international murders within the results. This query does not account for multiple murders mentioned within separate paragraphs, nor does it eliminate uses of the word “murder” in a non-literal way (such as describing something as “murderous”).

The second criteria which I would use to evaluate the Gazette would involve comparing the number of recorded murders per year to the number of actual murders per year, as provided by the Egyptian Consul General papers.\nMore Querying To begin these queries, I had to first determine what vocabulary would be most effective for searching. While the word “murder” had come to mind first, other words such as “homicide” and various forms of “kill” were used to describe these events. To evaluate which term was the most frequently used, I searched the following: count(//div[contains(.,’murder’)])\nWhere the word “murder” is would be interchanged for both kill and homicide to count the instances of these words. After a search of all three terms I found that murder returned 88 divs, kill returned 406 divs, and homicide returned zero divs. While it seemed that forms of the word kill were most prevalent, I read through about twenty of the results, and they were nowhere near as relevant as those that the term “murder” had returned. Most of the divs containing some form of kill either contained “murder” elsewhere in the paragraph (if it was describing a murder) or were more relevant to war. Since instances of war and other killings in non-murderous contexts (more common than it may seem) were far too common with the search including the word kill, I decided to stick with my original search of the term murder.\nTo find the instances of native murders, I wanted to ensure I was using the correct vocabulary for that search as well. I had seen native and Arab most commonly used within the paper to refer to the Egyptians, so I decided to see if “Arab,” “native,” or “Egyptian” would yield the most results. For this to be relevant within the context of my project, I searched the instances of these words occurring in the same paragraph with the word murder. The query is as follows: //div//p[matches(.,\u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][matches(.,\u0026#39;native\u0026#39;)]\nWhere the word “native” is was interchanged with the other two words. Within paragraphs that contained “murder,” “native” appeared to be the most frequently occurring of these terms.\nNow that I had a query that effectively found all of the instances of murder involving a native, I copied the results into Sublime Text and shaved them down to the date and the relevant text. I then went through all of the results and put them into an Excel sheet, noting the date of the report, who (as in what nationality) was murdered, who was responsible for the murder, and where the murder occurred. Some of the results were eliminated because they were regarding attempted murder, war, or lacked necessary information.\nAfter identifying all of the cases of murder in which Egyptians were either the victim, perpetrator, or both, I needed a way to identify all of the other murders in the Gazette. After some tries, I reached the following query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]/div[not(@feature=\u0026#34;wire\u0026#34;)]//p[matches(.,\u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;) and not(matches(.,\u0026#39;native\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;))]\nWhile not perfect, this query is able to find paragraphs containing murder that do not also contain the term native. In an attempt to hopefully eliminate news from other countries, I excluded divs with the feature “wire,” because I was noticing lots of telegrams reporting international murders within the results. This query does not account for multiple murders mentioned within separate paragraphs, nor does it eliminate uses of the word “murder” in a non-literal way (such as describing something as “murderous”). It did reduce the results down to about 424 items, which was a fairly believable number for the almost 3 1⁄2 years that …","date":1702425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702425600,"objectID":"28a49a3fa6e1dbdc84822483f1805460","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-west/","publishdate":"2023-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-analysis-west/","section":"post","summary":"For my analysis project, I wanted to observe how murder was reported in the Egyptian Gazette.

The reason why I chose this was because of the crazy claims these advertisements made. Medication and remedies for certain illnesses and pains have existed for a very long time. However, regulations to produce these medications didn’t come along until way later. The earliest of these regulations started with voluntary drug approval in 1905, but it wasn’t until 1938 when regulations for drug safety were put in place (FDA, 2006). Because of this, a lot of these pharmaceutical companies could get away with making medications out of questionable ingredients and claiming that they cure a whole list of symptoms (Library of Congress). Most of these medications were manufactured in the U.S., as the country was one of the leaders in the pharmaceutical industry at the time (Hamilton, 1951). These medications were then exported to other parts of the world, including Alexandria, Egypt where advertisements for these medications appeared in the local newspaper. My goal with this project was to look at what health issues and medications were brought up the most in the newspaper, The Egyptian Gazette, with the purpose of finding correlations between the two and to paint a picture of what health and pharmacy were like in Alexandria in the early 1900s.\nTo accomplish this, I started by coming up with a list of medications advertised in the paper. This proved to be slightly difficult since all the advertisements are different and none of them are labeled the same. Instead, I tried to find a specific word that all the medication advertisements had in common. This word wound up being the word “druggist” since all the medication advertisements contained a line and distribution containing this word. I was then able to use the query //div//div[matches(., ‘druggist’, ‘i’)] to find all the divs containing this word and, therefore, all the medications advertised. From there, I was able to comprise a list of 11 medications. The shortcoming of using this query, however, is that I probably missed any medications that had advertisements that did not contain this word. From there, I took each medication and used the query count(//div//div[matches(., “medication name”, ‘i’)]) to find the number of times each of these 10 medications were advertised in the paper.\nAfter finding all the medications, I wanted to find out what ailments were mentioned the most in the paper. This was accomplished by looking at certain keywords associated with the word “pain”. The query used was \\w+ \\w+ pain\\w* \\w+ \\w+ with the word “paint” being excluded in order to limit the number of false positives in my results. After this, the results were counted to see what ailments were associated the most with the word “pain”. The results of this query and the previous one were then analyzed and made into visualizations using Tableau.\nThis first visualization shows the results of the medication advertisements in the paper. Peruna by far had the most advertisements with 372, followed closely by Dr. William’s pink pills with 302. All other medications had less than half as many advertisements in the paper with some only having a handful.\nThe next visualization shows the results of the ailments associated with “pain”. Back pain and rheumatism appeared the most frequently with 87 and 68 hits respectively. Chest pain and headaches have about half as many hits as rheumatism with 29 and 23. All other ailments produced less than 20 hits.\nAfter doing some further research on each of the medications, some correlations can be made from these two sets of results. Back pain and rheumatism were two of the biggest complaints for ailments mentioned in the paper. Interestingly, the second most advertised medication, Dr. William’s pink pills, claims to be a treatment for rheumatism while the fourth most advertised medication, Doan’s backache and kidney pills, claims to be a treatment for backaches. So, it is clear that joint and back problems were common back in the early 1900s and medications for them were in high demand, hence the large number of advertisements. However, this pattern does not hold true for every medication. On the other hand, Peruna was by far the most advertised medication and is said to treat catarrh, but catarrh was only associated with pain a total of 4 times in the paper. This is a limitation of the query used. Catarrh is an illness caused by the buildup of mucus in the nose and throat, and while there are a few instances of illnesses being associated with “pain”, illnesses and diseases tend to not be described as painful (NHS, 2022). Therefore, very little of the results are made up of illnesses. A similar problem occurs with the third most advertised medication, Sanitas. Sanitas is a disinfectant used against bacterial infections. Bacterial infections were not associated at all with “pain”. This may be because bacterial infections weren’t considered to be painful, but …","date":1702425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702425600,"objectID":"03044ee0e517d9310649732873ddd486","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-cavaliere/","publishdate":"2023-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-analysis-cavaliere/","section":"post","summary":"For my analysis project, I decided to investigate the various medications advertised in the paper.

There was very minimal medicine research in this time period of 1904-1908, so death from illness seemed to be very common. When I found out about this project, I decided to try to gather information on what diseases affected the population the most. When I started querying, I was just simply searching using the word “disease”. I found interesting results, but I felt that there had to be more. I then started searching with the keywords “illness” and “plague”. I found more results and different types of conditions. Once I gathered some data, I started doing a more detailed query of searching for two words located in the same paragraph. I first started off with searching for “illness” and “death” in the same paragraph. I got minimal results, only 16 with three deaths reported from three different illnesses. This confirmed my thought of how illness wasn’t a descriptor in this time, and it seemed that illness was a word to describe less serious conditions. To prove, the main query for the word illness had 1,376 results. Next, I searched for “disease” and “death” in the same paragraph and got significantly more results. I was able to get a close estimate for the number of deaths from eleven diseases. Also, this query had more relevant results. Lastly, I searched for plague and death in the same paragraph and 1450 results. This helped me conclude that plague was more commonly used to describe conditions. Also, many of the conditions’ formal names had “plague” in them, which also led to more results. Throughout my searching time, I wrote down the data. When it came time to display the data, I initially chose to use a pie chart. However, I was recommended that this method was ineffective, so I changed the display to bar graphs. This helps the reader to get a better visual of the differences in the data. What sets my project apart from others studying a similar topic is that I do a more efficient search process by using three different key words instead of just one broad search. Also, I look at other readings and get a broad viewpoint on the topic. Thus, the trial-and-error process of this project allowed me to get a better understanding of the data, and the outside source (described below) helped me link the data together.\nIllness and Death Query only had 3 deaths from three different illnesses: Long illness, meningitis, and small pox\n//div//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;illness\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] [matches(.,\u0026#39;death\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]: 16 Results 1.1% of illness query: //div[contains(., \u0026#34;illness\u0026#34;)]: 1376 Results //div//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;disease\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] [matches(.,\u0026#39;death\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]: 144 Results 7.1% of disease query: //div[contains(., \u0026#34;disease\u0026#34;)]: 2016 Results //div//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;plague\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] [matches(.,\u0026#39;death\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]: 478 Results 34.7% of plague query: //div[contains(., \u0026#34;plague\u0026#34;)]: 1400 Results To give a description of the causes of diseases, I re-read a reading from one of our assigned readings called “Cruel Summer”. It talks about the illnesses mentioned in the data above, but it also brings up new diseases. First, a huge factor in the impact of diseases is the seasons. In Egypt, the dryness of Spring served as a carrier for diseases, and the air was not good for the lungs. On the other hand, warm weather stimulated the parasites lurking in the crops. Bacterial eye infections were extremely common from the summer heat. Farmers realized that there needed to be a change with the maintenance of crops, causing irrigation to be a new technique brought to the table. The title “Cruel Summer” is fitting for this article because of how the people suffered with the heat-induced diseases. Linking to the data, the article mentions that a very prevalent disease in agriculture was bilharzia. The article explains the cause of the virus, which isn’t mentioned in the gazette. It is caused by open skin wounds contacting water that contains the parasite. Also, for the demographics of infections, men were most vulnerable to parasite infection. At around 1908, scientists like Bonte Elgood were studying anatomy and trying to see what parts of the body the diseases affected. Also, new research methods started developing. For example, Elgood did a study of finding a percentage of urine samples with a certain virus. Next, it was obvious that World War I caused disease to spread because of the transportation of goods and soldiers. As the world was improving in technology and transportation, Egypt was seeing more diseases. This was at the threshold of new medicine advances. In summary, the data from the gazette and “Cruel Summer” link together and explain the context of the time.\n","date":1702425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702425600,"objectID":"e6250340db15791eff5fe607c5d826ae","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-schefstad/","publishdate":"2023-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-analysis-schefstad/","section":"post","summary":"Throughout my studies of the Egyptian Gazette, I always wondered how diseases affected the lifestyles and events of history.

Ichose this topic because I thought it would be interesting to research something that is not insideCairo or Alexandria, which makes up a majority of the Gazette’s news. When looking for a topic,I found trouble trying to find something that was significant on a global scale or at least outsideof Egypt and the Gazette. I found the Assouan Dam when I saw almost an entire half-pagededicated to it, and after further research found a story that had continued throughout the fouryears of news that is available. Assouan was an area that was both rich in agriculture as well astourism and historical importance.\nLocated on the border of the Upper Nile and Lower Nile, a dam was built in 1902 to helpthe agricultural industry as well as to protect Philae, an island in the Nile with an ancient templecomplex. The temples were built around 6th-7th Century BC and is Assouan’s biggest touristattraction even to this day. Due to Philae being a small island that had little elevation, it wasprone to flooding if there was no control on the water level. Cotton, grains, and lentils weremajor crops that would be exported to Cairo and presumably around the world. It required theNile to be at a steady level so that the fields would not get flooded. In early 1905, articles in theGazette showed people complaining that the dam was not high enough and floods wouldeventually come and ruin Philae and the crops. However, the government did not care, and theydid not raise the dam. In 1906, architects or scientists would show how the flooding is on track tobreach the dam. In late 1906, letters to the editor included some stern messages to thegovernment demanding for money to be allocated to the raising of the dam, still with no success.In July 1907, the dam flooded and ruined a lot of fields and flooded Philae, causing extensivedamage.\nThis was included in the Gazette likely because Assouan was a major agricultural hubthat would supply Alexandria and Cairo with crops. When I researched other reasons Assouanwas included in the newspaper, the most common appearances were in the export and importsections, as well as stating when ferries or boats were departing from a port to go to Assouan.This was also included because the federal government was responsible for allocating funds tothe construction and re-raising of the dam, not a local government. The Letter to the Editorssection included several messages from people who were complaining or demanding thesechanges in Assouan, so that made it a big deal up in North Egypt where the Gazette waspublished.\nThis analysis project looks at The Egyptian Gazette to see what context the Assouan Damis in throughout the newspaper. Originally using the ‘Find/Replace’ tool inside Oxygen XML, Icame across a lot of improper results for a lot of key words or phrases. Another issue I cameacross was word capitalization. I added a tag in my queries to make the word searches not casesensitive. Lastly, another tweak I made when querying was for the word ‘dam’ adding spacesbefore and after (‘ dam ‘) so that it would pick up whole words rather than parts of words such as ‘Damascus’. Instead of finding how many times each word was said as well, I decided to countinstances based on the number of sections included each term. This created a constant for allwords as well, just showing how relevant they were instead of how common a word was stated.One section could repeat “Assouan Dam” ten times and be as relevant as a section whose headeris “Assouan Dam” and it not stated again in the paragraphs.\nThe XML query format I used throughout this entire project was //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]/div/p[matches(., ‘assouan’, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] or if there was multiple words I needed to search for, //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]/div/p[matches(., \u0026#39;assouan’, ‘i’) and matches(., ’ dam ‘, ‘i’)].\nPrior to querying, I read about 20 sections that talked about the dam in order to see whatwas relevant to the topic. I found that a majority of sections about the dam talked or referred toone of three topics: agriculture, architecture, or the government. After initial querying, I foundthat some sections would not show up, so I had to group some keywords together into a section.Government was independent, agriculture included ‘irrigation’, while architecture included ‘temple’ and ‘Philae’. I wanted to visualize the instances of these sections in a way that wasdifferent than a bar graph. Bar graphs are efficient in showing one dimension, which is countinginstances. However, I added another dimension to the data visualization by showing overlap ofinstances between two or three keywords as well. A lot of important keywords were related,which stems back to my research topic. In order to visualize my data, I used Adobe Photoshop tocreate a landscape of rectangles that would clearly show a size difference that was based on thenumber of instances.

In being this cross-section of trade and travel throughout the world, it is evident that this rich context would impact its future with both foreign involvement and foreign adventure. Within the late 18th and early 19th century, whether by economic strife, political oppression, religious persecution, or some other outlying factor, there was a new mass migratory movement from the Levantine Ottoman Empire. Between the years of 1880 and 1924 around a half million Levantine Arabs left their homelands to obtain a sense of freedom economically, socially, and politically within the Americas, North, Central, and South (Fahrenthold). Recent economic forces had started to link the Mediterranean and Atlantic newly capitalistic economies, and in doing so created a labor vacuum that easily brought in these new Arab migrants (Fahrenthold). Egypt served as an integral part to this process in multiple ways, most principally being one of the major channels through which Levantine migrants had to pass in order to begin their journey to the Americas (Hitti 62) or by the fact that first Arabic periodicals from the Americas appeared in Egypt which then spurred a strong network of global readership between the US, Latin America, and Egypt (Fahrenthold). It is evident that by more than proximity but rather direct involvement with this phenomenon lends it to be something that could be particularly interesting in Egyptian society, and through that perhaps of note within the Egyptian Gazette itself. This analysis pursues this question, with the idea of the mention and opinion of Levantine migration found within the Egyptian Gazette.\nTopic Discussion My overall question is the discussion and portrayal of Levantine migration within Egyptian Gazette, which was prompted by my coincidental finding of a small blurb about “Syrian Immigration to Jamaica” that I found in the local and general section of one of the editions I was encoding. This led to the curiosity of whether other forms of Levantine migration were mentioned, and if so, how often, where,why, and in what light. In essence this topic begets itself to be qualitative work and analysis, which contrasts to the more quantitative leaning of the class and project; however, I deem it reflective as to what Digital Humanities is as a whole, as DIH work is based in this cross-section of the qualitative and the quantitative as a form of computational history. This mindset imbued itself into my attitude towards the project directly affected my method in querying this topic.\nQuerying Process, Visualizations, and Overall Findings My querying process used a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches through my employment of multiple X-Paths. The more quantitative X-Path used was count(//p[matches(., \u0026#34;migration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;) or matches(., \u0026#34;migrant\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)]) . I utilized this to gain a numerical look at how often these two words were mentioned to 1) dissect if there was a consistent pattern of repeated use during certain months or years and 2) to compare with a graph sourced from Kemal Karpat and utilized by Stacy Fahrenthold that demonstrated the “Annual Rate of Immigration to the United States from Turkey in Asia” [the Levant] (Fahrenthold).. In comparing these two graphs I would be able to see if there is a correlation with higher immigration rates to higher mention rates within the Egyptian Gazette. The visualizations can be seen below:\nYearly count of mentions of Migration and Migrant in the Egyptian Gazette Monthly count of mentions of Migration and Migrant in the Egyptian Gazette annual rate of immigration from Turkey in Asia In analyzing the three visualizations it is evident the rise of immigration from 1905-1908 is mirrored by the increasing reference of migration within the Egyptian Gazette, along with the simultaneous decrease in 1908. A weakness of this X-path/question is made apparent by the Karpat graph, in the sense that the database simply does not have the dates available where we see the highest peaks in immigration. Within this Xpath and the ones to discuss next, there was an issue with only getting a smaller number of hits than would be deemed useful or substantial. Especially for quantitative analysis, the limited range of hits impacts the substantialness of the data itself. However, if the mirroring trends made apparent with the current data set are accurate, then it could set the groundwork for predicting the use of migration in the Egyptian Gazette in the future.\nIn my more qualitative exploits used and tested out a myriad of Xpaths which included:\n//p[matches(., \u0026#34;immigration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;) or matches(., \u0026#34;migrant\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)]/parent::div/@feature //div[@feature=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34; and matches(., \u0026#34;immigration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)] //div[@feature=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34; and matches(., \u0026#34;migration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)] …","date":1670803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670803200,"objectID":"71c301a9c6213d4196c58d6576caa706","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-alrahil/","publishdate":"2022-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-alrahil/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction and Historical Context The Middle East and North Africa are regions particularly known for its different eras and patterns of shifting or displacing the locations of its populaces over the past centuries.","tags":null,"title":"The Question of Levantine Immigration","type":"post"},{"authors":["Miriam Alrahil"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":" Within the issue of October 8, 1907 under the Local and General Section, an interesting deviation from the normalities of that column appeared. Within this small paragraph it is discussed that a heavier influx of Syrians, which could describe both people from what is known as modern day Syria or from the Levant as a while, along with Chinese migrants to Jamaica. This “oriental” influx seemingly pushed the Government of Jamaica to prevent their entrance into the country, as it would pose a threat to local traders in the region. From this the City Council of Kingston pushed to amend the pauper alien immigration law to hinder the landing of “undesirable foreigners” in what was portrayed as an act of economic self preservation for other natives. The mention of this phenomenon mirrors the overarching trends found within this period, as Levantine/Syrian migration abroad for work had started becoming a more integral facet of the Middle Eastern existence and economy. This also coincided with other Eastern communities, especially Japanese and Chinese, doing the same, hence the mention of the Chinese immigrant influx as well within this short text. This started creating a new world social schema, and the racially targeted legislation that is seen being discussed had and would start popping up in different countries within the Western Hemisphere. This curiosity offers a small window in the overarching migrational patterns that characterized that time.\nSources Fahrenthold, Stacy D. “Arab Labor Migration in the Americas, 1880–1930.” Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History (2019).

Throughout studying The Egyptian Gazette, there are recurring themes regarding the improvement and deterioration of crime in Alexandria. Throughout the early 1900s, the frequency of crime varied extremely, as the people of Alexandria experienced new things every year.\nAs with any society throughout history, crime was a very common theme among society. Through scouring the Judicial Adviser Reports Judicial Adviser Report, I found that there were about 2000 crimes a year. As said before though, the crimes that most interested me were those of violence and occasionally a resulting death.\nThroughout the Egyptian Gazette death is reported on regularly. I used an X-Path to search for all the headings of divs that contained the words “dead” and “death.” This query paid no regard to whether the words were lowercase or uppercase, by searching //body/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’))]/head. This search gave me 3456 returns from throughout the newspaper. Through doing this research, I found that although death was constantly reported on, not all the results were death involving murder or violent crime. There were a vast majority of other hits that came back regarding death from other means such as suicide and sickness. Throughout the Egyptian Gazette, violent crime was also customarily reported on. Through using the X-path, //div[matches(.,’violent crime’,’i’)]/@feature, I found that violent crime was reported on not nearly as much as death. Just as death encompasses a lot of facets outside of murder, such as suicide, sickness, and natural death, violent crime has a lot of things to report on as well. Among these crimes were vicious acts such as arson, robbery, and assault. This leads to a massive number of reports for death, murder, and violent crime. Through more searching within the entire content repository, using xpaths searching for key words such as “arson” and “robbery,” I was able to narrow down my results regarding violent crime even more. Arson was reported on about as much as robbery, and the sum of the two of them was more than the quantity in which violent crime was reported on. I think that this is because although “violent crime,” seems like a broad search term, that it just is not mentioned as much as the specific crimes themselves.\nAs you can see from the above data visualization, the actual types of violent crime are reported a lot more than violent crime itself. In the Egyptian gazette, the actual crime is reported a lot less frequently than it is accounted for in the judicial adviser reports written by the government. I think that this could be for various reasons. The main reason in which I think that crime and death is not reported as frequently as it is actually committed is because the newspaper tries to maintain a positive tone and mood. On the contrary though, I think that the newspaper should also be reporting events like these to keep the people of Egypt updated and informed on what is going on among them. As you can see in the data visualization, there is also a major discrepancy between the frequency in which violent crime in general is reported in the Egyptian Gazette than in the Judicial Adviser Reports. The coverage of crime in the Egyptian Gazette is not nearly as proportionately covered as it should be. According to The British in Egypt. Community, Crime and Crises, 1882–1922 by Saul Kelly, there was also just far more material on the ruling elite than the common folk. As a result, most crime was committed by the common folk so although it was accounted for in the Judicial Adviser reports it was not reported on as much. This is what I also think lead to less crime being actually reported in the newspapers than was being committed. No one wants to read about the “average joe” or “common folk” guy next door getting killed or robbed, they like to hear about the elites getting themselves into trouble which occured much less frequently.\nMany factors also contribute to the increase or decrease of crime that transcend people’s free will to do as they please. In the years that farmland was uncultivated, there was always an increase in theft and robbery due to a subsequent increase in poverty and desperation for sustenance. As the people of Egypt got more desperate and there was more unrest, the murder rates also increased. Whether it was an increase in land disputes because of fiscal hardship or a lack of prevention by public security, murder and crime, unrest ran rampant.\n","date":1670457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670457600,"objectID":"fbdf9b2f7e955d9fd73150a152221c7a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-deptula/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-deptula/","section":"post","summary":"Crime in Alexandria has always been a topic of discussion among the people that call it home and in the newspapers that those people read.

Can X-Path analysis tell us anything about the origins and impact of the crash?\nUsing a series of cell-measure commands in X-path, I scanned the repository of newspapers produced in Cairo in the 1900s to find the share price of three companies each in different markets of the microeconomy. Record the share price each time they show up in the issues and plot them to see the impact on each market specifically.\nAfter importing the data into google sheets, I was able to produce the above chart.

The two largest religious groups of Egypt are the Muslim community and the Christian community, with the Muslim community in particular making up the majority of the religious influence in the country. The smaller religious group I am talking about is Judaism, while Judaism is a very large religion internationally in the country of Egypt it is and has been dying out. To give accurate numbers, as stated in The Cultural Atlas “The vast majority of the Egyptian population (90%) identify as Muslim, mostly of the Sunni denomination. Of the remaining population, 9% identify as Coptic Orthodox Christian and the remaining 1% identify with some other denomination of Christianity.”\nGraph Paragraphs in each issue that mention “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan” The graph that appears above can be complicated to understand, so I figured that I should break it down and make it more understandable for most viewers. This graph is a visualization of how often the words “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan” are mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I chose these words as they are the most common ways to refer to the people of these religions in Egypt and so are best suited for finding this information in the Egyptian Gazette. The information is separated into months throughout the years 1904-1907, the red line is the word “Jew”, the blue line is “Christian”, and the green line is “mohammedan”.\nJudaism Jewish people as a whole are a very small part of the Egyptian population with there only being three Jews in the entirety of egypt as of right now. Why, then, does the graph above show that the word “Jew” is mentioned often in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the answer to this is that the Egyptian Gazette was not based around talking about the local groups but more the world and the news involved as whole, this would make far more sense as the news about Judaism in the world would coincide with the high number of mentions of the word “Jew”. As I researched some important events that occurred in Judaism over the years of 1904-1907 I came across a large event that must have caused the News to talk about it for many years. This was the Russian Revolution of 1905, which was a revolution that had an incredibly large amount of Jewish people in it, due to the horrible discrimination being put upon them by the Russian government. As stated in The role of the Jews in the Russian Revolutionary Movement “While the Jews formed only seven million out of a total population of 136 million, about fifty percent of the membership of the Revolutionary parties was Jewish”. This event had long and big impacts on Judaism as a whole and would have most definitely provided a big spike in Jewish news throughout the world. This is, in my opinion, a strong reason for the large amount of time that the word “Jew” is mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I must also mention that while the word “Jew” was mentioned many times in the Gazette there is also a possibility that the word “Jew” could be a part of something else such as the name of a place or part of the word Jewel, however I believe that the vast majority of these mentions were based in talking about Judaism instead.\nChristianity Christianity as whole is one of the largest religions in the entire world boasting around 2.2 billion followers around the world. This humongous religion is also a large part of Egypts religious groups making up around 9% of the people in Egypt. However, as we have learned with Judaism and the word “Jew” being a large part of Egypt does not seem to be a big factor in if a religion is mentioned more or not in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the large amounts of mentions of the word “Christian” in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette is due to simply how big and notable of a religion Christianity is as a whole. Due to Christianities size there is always news and things going on that involve the word “Christian” hence the large amount of hits. The Egyptian Gazette is able to report on the news inside the country involving Christians as well as the many other important things going on with the religion outside of it. One notable Christian event that could coincide with the high number of times the word “Christian” appears could be the Indian Pentecost occurring in India in 1905. As talked about in Indian Pentecost the Indian Pentecost was a large religious movement in India where Christianity had a sudden and strong revival in the country due to various missionaries spreading their message. This had little to no effect on India however it most definitely made the news and caused a large influx in the amount of time the word “Christian” appeared in the Egyptian Gazette. This and many more events involving Christianity are constantly occurring around the world so …","date":1670284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670284800,"objectID":"b9e0d87cac9ebb3fc56096ce253a80f4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-obos/","publishdate":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-obos/","section":"post","summary":"A look at how often three religions are talked about in the Egyptian Gazette and why.","tags":["Religion","Judaism","Christianity","Islam"],"title":"What's Going on with Religion in the Egyptian Gazette?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Combs"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Death and its causes are widely reported in the Egyptian Gazette, however it is not reported equally at all times of the year. Knowing the months when death is most common allows for further analysis on what causes the death rate to change throughout the year. This can also be done with the various causes of death such as murder. This knowledge gives some insight into what it was like to live in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 1900s.\nTo answer the question of what causes the death rate to change throughout the year I first ran the x-path query count(//div[matches(., \u0026#39;dea[d,th]\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]). I also ran the same x-path query for murder, suicide, plague, and cholera because those where all common causes of death at the time. The first thing I noticed in the death rate is that it consistently rises from July through September before it drops then peaks in January. This increase in death during the summer months can be explained by looking at the rates for murder and plague, which both have higher rates during the summer months.\nAccording to Nathan Wilson, even in modern times the summer months are when crimes are at its peak, including violent crimes such as murder. One cause of this is that the temperatures are simply higher than they are at other times of the year. The belief is that the discomforting higher temperature “acts as a stressor and alters the brain’s chemistry”. This makes people irritable and prone to anger, which would naturally cause more people to commit murder in the heat of the moment. Egypt has longer daylight hours in the summer months than any other time of year. The longer daylight hours coupled with the elevated temperature cause people to have lower quality sleep than they would otherwise. This lower quality sleep has been linked to impulsivity and aggression, which can also cause people to commit murder in the heat of the moment.\nAn increase in the murder rate is not the only reason that the death rate rises in the summer. The amount of reported cases of the plague is also much higher around the same time that the death rate was increased. According to Tamara Ben-Ari et al., there are many factors that affect rodent fleas. Some of these factors include ambient temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. When there is warm and moist weather then there will likely be more fleas. Flea development also increases with temperature, until it reaches a certain point. If the temperature is too high and the humidity is too low then the survival rate for immature fleas will drop. This would explain the rates of the plague seen in The Egyptian Gazette because while the plague frequency is consistently higher in the summer, sometimes it seems to randomly drop prematurely. This is likely due to either the temperature rising too high or the humidity dropping too low, if not both.\nThe more difficult trend in the death rate is the peak that occurs in the winter months, despite the fact that both the murder rate and the plague frequency are usually lower in the same periods. The suicide rate is much more random that any other cause of death so it serves to explain some isolated months such as December 1906, but it does not explain why the death rate regularly peaks at this time. Similarly, the cases of cholera are low throughout the year, except for January 1908, which appears to have had an outbreak of sorts, which can explain the high death rate in that month, but nothing else.\nIt is likely that this heightened death frequency is from a plethora of causes as opposed to the increase in the summer, which is much easier to pinpoint. According to W. R. Keatinge, it is known that respiratory diseases are more common in the winter. This is because people tend to gather together inside to avoid the cold, which increases the chances for cross infection. On top of that it is also believed that winter temperatures cool the mucus in the upper respiratory tract. This essentially suppresses the immune system and makes it more difficult to fight infections. These two factors make death much more likely in the winter because people would be more vulnerable to a plethora of respiratory diseases and other diseases such as the flu.\nThere is another explanation for why the death rates would increase in this time period, but it would only apply to the audience for The Egyptian Gazette because they are more likely to be English than other people in Egypt at the time. Accoridng to Mitsuru Shimizu and Brett Pelham, people can essentially postpone their deaths for one last holiday. In this case it would likely be Christmas or New Years, which is why this would only apply to the English-Egyptians because they are more likely to be Christians. The authors believe that this death deferral effect is that people make conscious decisions to survive for one last major holiday. While this explanation certainly contributes to the elevated death rate in the winter, the primary cause is likely to be increased disease due to a suppressed …","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670198400,"objectID":"5c2e100b5a4e3ab5307738cf5491acf0","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-combs/","publishdate":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-combs/","section":"post","summary":"Death and its causes are widely reported in the Egyptian Gazette, however it is not reported equally at all times of the year.

What was once a vast, threatening force that conquered the last remnants of the Roman Empire and spanned across Africa was now a kind of joke to the great European powers. After all, France and Britain had to aid the Ottomans in warding off Russia in the Crimean War (1853-1856), and Britain was de facto occupying Ottoman Egypt from 1882 until the Empire itself collapsed and beyond. These events were major blows to the image of this once feared empire, and they led to the idea that it was powerless. This is shown in the political cartoon: Tough on Turkey, which depicts Russia as a bear and England as a lion bullying the Ottoman Empire, which is portrayed as a turkey.\nPortrayal of the weakness of the Turkish Empire in comparison to early-modern Europe While this was the common interpretation of Turkey’s power in Britain, the British citizens that occupied Ottoman land would likely have a different relationship with the nation, being how they are in such close quarters with it. Thus, I look to find how the British living in Ottoman-controlled Egypt (practically in name only) viewed the Empire using the common phrases surrounding the word “Turks” within the Egyptian Gazette Digital Library.\nFirstly, I looked to find how many times the phrase “Turks” showed up in any feature. I did this primarily because it was the search query for the group project, but I figured that this could still be useful just to show the amount of times it was mentioned. Note, I did not choose the phrase “Ottoman” because the amount of advertisements for Ottoman banks or bonds was absolutely enormous. I will get back to that further in this essay. Going back to the query, I used the phrase //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;Turks\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature\nAs stated previously, this looked across all features of the newspaper that contained the word “Turks” within it. The “i” allows for the search to not be case sensitive. I plugged this query into the X-Path 2.0 feature in Oxygen to get fifty-eight (58) items throughout the contents. Here is a visualization of that spread, as done by Tableau:\nAs shown here, the phrase “Turks” is not present in advertisements (at least not much) since it appears in the later pages of the Gazette whenever it shows up. This allows for interpretation surrounding the phrases, as the paper is not being paid to print in the interest of Ottoman businesses. It also spans across the period of 1905-1907, thus it is generally a common occurrence (for the phrase only being used fifty-eight times anyways). It also falls under a wide range of topics as well under the Feature legend. Suffice to say, the Turks were on the minds of the British in Egypt relatively consistently, but what exactly are their thoughts?\nLooking at the Egyptian Gazette, the answer is not entirely clear when querying these results. Much of the reporting on this topic is neutral, or at the very most just describing what the Turks did, or what happened to them, etc. One good example of this came from one of the earlier editions in 1905, in which it writes: “The Turks killed 30 Albanians in a fight near the town.” It has this but offers no opinion on it as it was just a story. Along with this, much of the way the text is written does not have much overarching ideas about the Turks. I found one example against that, but it is far and few between. This one writes about the Ottomans celebrating the anniversary of their Empire’s formation, with a royal prince discussing the “the sad situation in Turkey proper, owing to its bad government.” Overall, looking through this query one can find that the Turks (at least in that phraseology) is not discussed geo-politically much. However, there is more to this analysis. That being looking further into the phrase: “Ottoman”.\nAs previously stated, most of the mentions of the word “Ottoman” was found in advertisements. While there is the ability to eliminate advertisements in the query, many of them were listed as “items”, which eliminating those would make poor results. This could be seen as a limitation to this analysis, however, there is still information that could be taken from this issue. The fact that there are thousands of these advertisements shows that this Empire was important to the Brits in Egypt, otherwise there would not be so many of them if at all. One could make the argument that Ottoman business was seen as important to the occupiers. Therefore, through this lens I feel that the Ottomans/Turks were important to the British in Egypt overall, as they are in such close quarters with them that Ottoman business was a part of daily life.\nUltimately, I do believe that the British in Alexandria did regard the Ottoman Empire as important, or at least more important than Londoners, because they were living on Turkish soil.

I took interest in this ad and proceeded to research this drug and its creator and came across many interesting facts about this apparent “wonder-drug”.\nApparently it was branded as being able to cure Catarrh, which NHS Inform tells us is a buildup of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body. A previous post (“Miraculous Medicine”) talks about another ad featuring a women suffereing from Catarrh for three years until Peruna cured it. We now know that this is a harmless condition that will eventually go away and is easily treated through things like saline nasal rinse, avoiding allergens, and staying well hydrated. However, these treatments were far less known back in the time of “Pe-Ru-Na” and so this “drug” was able to gain customers. As found in the Ann Arbor District Library, all you needed to do was take a tablespoon of “Pe-Ru-Na” before each meal and when you go to sleep and Catarrh will go away perfectly.\nAs I researched more into this “drug” I confirmed what I had begun to suspect, that “Pe-Ru-Na” was a scam and can be easily made by almost anyone. As stated in “Pe-Ru-Na for Catarrh- The Great American Fraud,” “Any one wishing to make Peruna for home consumption may do so by mixing half a pint of cologne spirits, 190 proof, with a pint and a half of water, adding thereto a little cubebs for flavor and a little burned sugar for color.” In summary, “Pe-Ru-Na” was a drug scam that was run back in the early 1900’s that ended up just being common alcohol with a little extra mixed in. This scam became incredibly popular because of all of the ads about people proclaiming that Peruna “saved their lives”, as can be seen in “Advertising, Has anything Really Changed”.\nDespite the drug being a scam, it was far more welcomed in the United States. The US was in the middle of Prohibition, and Peruna could still be sold over the counter. As mentioned in a fellow blog post about Pe-Ru-Na Peruna became so popular that people named their children after it, with the Southern Methodist University naming their school mascot Peruna. All together though I believe this to be a funny example of past scams that can be looked upon in retrospect while laughing.\n","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670198400,"objectID":"78ec936fb4e1a4a95a5b787eab2affb1","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-12-05-obos/","publishdate":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-12-05-obos/","section":"post","summary":"A blog post about the scam run in the early 1900's called Pe-Ru-Na","tags":["Drug","Scam"],"title":"Pe-Ru-Na the 1900 drug scam","type":"post"},{"authors":["Annie Kryvorutsky"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"For my project, I decided to stem off my group project concept of deaths in the Egyptian Gazette and focused solely on the comparison of Native Egyptian death reports versus European death reports throughout the newspaper. I chose to investigate this topic because I thought it would be interesting to see the attitudes of the British towards the natives through death reports and compare those attitudes with those towards Europeans and other British people. I had a very minimal previous knowledge of tensions between the natives and the British, because of British colonialism in Egypt, but I wanted to learn more about it and see if these tensions were reflected in the Egyptian Gazette. I also wanted to compare the number of deaths reported for natives and Europeans, in hopes of seeing if there was a drastic difference within the number of deaths of each, or to see if there was bias in reporting deaths of either group when compared with real statistics of deaths in Alexandria.\nAt first, I only focused on comparing the layout of native deaths and British/English deaths. I did this by completing 3 queries:\n//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’native’,’i’))]/head\n//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’british’,’i’))]/head\n//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’english’,’i’))]/head\nThe first query allowed me to find the headings of all divs that had both “death” and “native” in them, while the second and third allowed me to do the same while searching for “British” and “english” alongside “death”. I included both “english” and “British” in order to get as many relevant results as possible by using different ways of describing one group of people. I tried doing this with native deaths as well by searching “Egyptian”, but the majority of results were irrelevant since the word “Egyptian” comes up countless times throughout the Egyptian Gazette.\nFor my search of native deaths, I got around 180 results, while for the search of English/British deaths I got 150 results. I was able to visualize the data into 3 different charts. For the first chart, I made 2 separate bar graphs that showed the count of native and English deaths per month, quarter, and year. For the native death reports, a drastic majority occurred within the summer months, while for the English death reports, the death rate was highest in both the summer and winter months.\nThe second visualization I made was a tree map that highlighted the most commonly used headlines when reporting native and British deaths. Both charts showed “The Plague” headline to make up for most of the death reports, however native deaths had more than double the amount of plague death reports than British deaths. Furthermore, when looking at the general descriptions of headlines, it was obvious to me that the native death headlines were often much more gruesome and tragic than the British death headlines.\nChapter 5 of The Third Pandemic of Plague in Egypt highlights how Alexandria was a particularly easy city to get infected by the plague, because of its “crowded population, of middle class and poor people, living under bad housing conditions.” The plague had a case mortality rate of around 50% during the early 1900’s and every year had multiple cases of plague appearance between 1899-1930. This source also depicts which quarters in Alexandria had the most cases of plague, with Labban, one of the most infected areas, being inhabited by poor Egyptians and poor and middle-class Greeks, Maltese, and Italians. The least infected cities – Ramleh, Attarin, and Gomrok – contain modern European establishments and house the upper-class Alexandrians. This gives insight into why the plague was such a huge factor of deaths in Alexandria and why natives experienced a much greater number of deaths from the plague.\nThe final visualization that I made from this search was a chart to show the frequency of death reports per page. I found that the charts for both nationalities were very similar, in that they both dramatically peaked at Page 3. However, my search for English death reports generated a lot more results in pages 4-7 than my search for native deaths did. I found this curious, but it makes sense since in the 8-page issues of the Gazette, the Army and Navy section often appears on page 4, which I would assume mostly consists of British soldiers. Additionally, the Local and General section along with the Native Press section would report on most native Egyptian deaths, which are both on page 3, and not many Egyptian deaths are reported outside that section.\nDiving deeper into the language associated with deaths in the Egyptian Gazette, I decided to focus solely on the Local and General section, since I did not want any deaths outside of Egypt in my data set. Doing this, my estimate that there were more native deaths reported than European was once again reassured through seeing the results of my query.

Since this topic has already been thoroughly examined by other students in the past, we had to find something that would add new insight to how the Gazette reported upon deaths in the early 1900’s. As a result, we decided to study the various components of life in Egypt that affected death and its subsequent presence in the Egyptian Gazette as reports, articles, and expositions. We also researched how violent crime is reported in the Egyptian Gazette in comparison to murder. Throughout various research methods, we discovered that death was one of the most prevalent topics of conversation in the Egyptian Gazette.\nDeath is something that is very often reported throughout the Gazette, with multiple cases reported per day. Going through thousands of results for the words “death” and “dead” would be a hard task in order to find trends and useful insight to how the British in Alexandria spoke on death in the early 1900’s. However, we still started with a very broad query search to get a basic idea of the organization of death reports throughout the newspaper. We used X-Path to search for all the headings of divs that contained the words “dead” and “death”, without paying attention to whether the words were uppercase or lowercase, by searching //body/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’))]/head.\nThis gave us a search result of 3458 items, which we then used regular expression in Sublime Text to just keep the dates, headings, and page numbers of our results. After this, we organized the results into excel, proceeding to use Tableau to create visualizations of Death Headings throughout the Gazette. We were able to organize the data with a bar graph to show the frequency of death reports per month, quarter, and year. This gave us a basic idea of which seasons deaths occurred the most in, which could be significant in understanding life in Alexandria during the early 20th century.\nFrom this visualization, we clearly saw that deaths most often occurred in peak winter and summer months, with January 1906 having the greatest number of occurrences of death. According to the Judicial Adviser Report from 1904 written by the British Judicial Adviser, death was most frequently caused by vengeance and cupidity. These months often lead to an increase in social interaction, which therefore caused an increase in feelings of greed and retribution. As a result, death sharply increased.\nAnother way we were able to visualize the data of all dead headings throughout the repository was by finding which headings death was most often reported under. We completed this by using a tree-map to show the most often used headings. Through this visualization, it was revealed that the “Local and General” heading was most often used by far; there were almost 300 results under this heading. The next largest headings were “Northern Italy,” “Personal and Social,” “Telegrams,” “Death,” “The Plague,” “Obituary,” and “Death”. This type of visualization was helpful in allowing us to identify the basic structure of where deaths are reported in the Gazette.\nWe also investigated the features that most often featured the words “Death,” “Dead,” and “Died”. The X-Path query we used for this was //div[matches(.,’death’,’i’)]/@feature, once again adding the “i” to ignore the case of the word, then changed the word inside the apostrophes to “dead” then “died”, going through every div to find the features that included these words. I did this in a slightly more tedious way that I could’ve done, but I got separate results for each word, which showed the frequency of the words in each feature. My results showed that the features “local,” “wire,” “social,” “birthDeathMarriage,” “obituary,” and “army” had the largest amount of death reports in them.\nThe final visualization we made to help us understand the headings of death was a comparison between the count of death headings and the page number that they occurred on. This visualization showed us that death occurred on every single page, but was much more frequently reported on Page 3, which had 1,167 reports of death; around 10 times more than any other page. This makes sense since the 3rd page most often reports telegrams, local and general, and personal and social sections. These were some of the sections that had the most frequent reports of death.\nWith all this information about the layout of death reports in the Egyptian Gazette, I wanted to find some additional insight to death reports that would help me understand more about the reports themselves, rather than just the layout of the reports. I figured that looking into the language used when describing these deaths would be very beneficial in broadening our understanding the way that the British in Egypt talked about death. In order to do this, I decided to use a simpler to find more words in the divs surrounding the word “death”.

One of the main crops they pushed was the production of wheat. It was a crop that was easy to multiply and produce mass amounts. One of the programs was the Cairo Agricultural show; this was an opportunity for the grower to show off their wheat production to potential buyers. It was a great networking event for both farmers and produce buyers. The best crop of the season had the opportunity to win cash prizes, in recognition of their large work. Another thing the government did was the Suez canal, which was a significant government transportation portal for the exporting of wheat. Great Britain exported most wheat, leaving little for the people “as little as 1/5 of the wheat was kept for the people” (The Egyptian Gazette). Of the 1/5 portion is reproduced into other products such as bread, etc. This action was done with a little more of a selfish nature of increasing economic revenue rather than helping the individual farmer. However, to make up for this selfish nature, the government would deal with the crime of people stealing each other’s crops and has taken these cases very seriously. These weren’t too common, but sometimes these cases even escalated to murder.\nOver time, controversy began to grow about whether wheat or cotton was more profitable. The British saw wheat as mainly a single-dimensional product that was only for flour production. The thought instead, the big cash crop was cotton due to the greater demand during the civil war times and greater transferability. This is mentioned throughout the feature “British flour for Egypt” in the Egyptian Gazette. Although the British thought this, they still did a lot to help increase the production of wheat; in the Egyptian Gazette, the feature “abridged prospectus” explained the process of purchasing the land and how the process was meant to incentivize people to buy and start cultivating the wheat crop. The most popular land was lower Egypt which had the rich soil to grow good wheat. The process of securing land could get a little complicated, but there was a program to help poorer people get their foot in the door. Through this program, you could buy a share of land and make payments. However, if you miss only one payment, your entire land could be revoked. These payments could be expensive, especially with the hefty tax you pay to auditors. The auditors themselves were also noticeably know to be cruel and unfair, flaunting their power. This extreme policy and inconsiderate treatment really pressured farmers to produce most of the crops. This excessive production made local features such as “Khartoum’s wheat crop” describe wheat as a very profitable crop since it was written from the local perspective. Throughout the paper we find these contradictory articles of local’s vs British persuasion I can see thorough business features, world reposts, sometimes even personal articles people express show this tension is affecting the consciously or subconsciously.\nThese variety of government programs led to increase in the cultivation of the wheat crop but sacrificed the fair treatment of the farmers. The government created a hamster on the wheel type system. The focus was shifted from the people to instead focusing on forging perceptions and paying taxes overseas. However, due to the government distracted focus, the middlemen tax collectors were able to bend the rules and regulations as they saw fit. Therefore, creating the problem of bribery and illegal manipulation. These unfair systems and poor representation left the government in a negative light of the common people eyes. Throughout history we can see how distrust of the government often leads to riot and chaos. Thought the distrust in this government was common, it did run smooth enough to keep the people in check and the economy growing. This can be seen in the Egyptian gazette feature called “British Flour”. Throughout this text, they talk about the shift from wheat production to more cotton production due to its further profitability. The article details how as wheat increased, the demand and sales remained the same, and the primary consumers were the British Mill. The gazette Cereal tables exhibit that although foreign governments such as the British didn’t increase their wheat purchase during March of 1907, wheat remained at a sturdy price due to Egypt’s ability to distribute the extra grain elsewhere. This displays wheat’s ability to have stable and growing production and how it was an essential part of commerce, even though government support was shifting.\nXpath //p[matches(., \u0026#39;government\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;) and matches(., \u0026#39;wheat\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]\nLinks Land Owner Rule Post.\n","date":1669939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669939200,"objectID":"e8ff69b922ee3a9ca7b10ef181c559cd","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-rupkalvis/","publishdate":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-rupkalvis/","section":"post","summary":"The government had a variety of programs to increase agriculture.

The question we decided to base our research on is how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression. The way to answer this question took us a long time to figure out due to how large of a question this is, we ended up having to collaborate and brainstorm many different ideas before coming up with a simple and effective solution. The solution we came up with to achieve this task was to create a general Xpath query that we could use in each of our individual projects and compare and contrast the data and information we got with this query. We all created visualizations based off of this Xpath query to make this goal more achievable. The question itself and the methodology used to solve were very useful for each of our individual projects, especially as many of our personal questions are complicated and difficult to answer. With this group project question we can work on our own projects as a side effect of the group project question we are answering. In summary, we are a qualitative data group who are trying to answer how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression.\nFinding a Query As our group had many different topics, finding a common query seemed like a rather daunting task. Tying religion to military ranks to mummies, etc. looked to be somewhat impossible, especially considering how each individual project was specific in its own unique way. Thus, our query ended up being broad to fit the various objectives we had, which ended up being tied to our research methods (qualitative research). The query ended up being how many times a certain word that related to our project showed up across the entire Egyptian Gazette digital catalog, in any feature. We had mentions of the words: “Commander”, “Turks”, “Migration”, “Yours truly”, and so on and so forth.\nThe expression we ended up using was //div[matches(.,‘x’, ‘i’)]/@feature, with “x” being the word we searched for. We put this into the XPath 2.0 search bar in the Oxygen Editor and queried the contents of the whole newspaper with our individual terms. Once the whole contents were queried, we copied over the results into a plain text editor, where we would edit it to be usable in an Excel spreadsheet. From there, we would copy it into Tableau, the application that visualizes the results.\nThe way the query worked shows how similar our data collection methods are. While the query itself is incredibly broad, it is a good representation of what we will do in our individual analysis projects. Specific searches would not work; thus, this method is likely the lowest common denominator that we have as a group.\nCreating Visualizations With our XPath query, we were searching for a few simple results in common for otherwise uncommon topics of study. Our query yielded the feature, date, and page number of every division that contained a keyword of our respective independent research efforts. With this data we sought to generate a set of visualizations that used the same type of data in roughly the same style and theme, to be easily compared to one another for possible similarities and discrepancies in the patterns of each, which could indicate a connection between the different topics.\nWe chose to use the date, feature count, page number, and feature for our visualizations. We formatted them in roughly the same manner, with a basic scatterplot styling. We placed the date variable along the x-axis and plotted the page number variable along the y-axis. The feature count data points are placed at each of their respective dates and page numbers, and then color coded each data point with its corresponding feature name.\nThis method of visualization provides for a simplistic, understandable representation of our data. The matching formats and color coding allow for an easy way to compare our seemingly unrelated data just from glancing at each of the charts. Weaknesses of this visualization are that you cannot gather much just from these charts, only use them to infer about events that may have caused them to have patterns that coincide at the same time, leading to further investigation and research. While that is a glaring weakness, there is not much else to start out from researching, as the topics in question do not have much in common, so we must find similarities and differences before any reasoning can be found.\nComparing and Contrasting Our Visualizations Once we completed our visualizations, we could embark on the analysis of our results.

This led me to research the types of illness the medicine advertisements claimed to cure. The final question I decided to research is: whether illnesses mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette are comparable modern illnesses of the same name. I compiled a list of the most common diseases mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette, but in the end, catarrh was the sickness about which I was most curious. The three companies I considered were Peruna, Allenburys’, and Dr. William’s Pink Pills.\nPeruna is a very familiar sight in the Egyptian Gazette. Overwhelmingly, Peruna promised to cure catarrh and consumption. Peruna referenced catarrh as a sickness, “Peruna is the best remedy for all catarrhal diseases. When the catarrh has become systemic, – that is, when it has been allowed to spread through the entire system, it is a difficult disease to cure” (“PE-RU-NA was successful where doctors failed”, June 26, 1906). By reading the quote from the newspaper, it is apparent that the authors of the advertisement thought of catarrh as a disease. Today, the term catarrh is not as prolific. Its meaning is also more ambiguous. The definition of catarrh according to Merriam-Webster is an “inflammation of a mucous membrane” (Catarrh). Peruna claims catarrh can be of the head, throat, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and pelvic organs. According to the British Medical Journal from 1859, the symptoms of catarrh are: grit in the eye, headache, impairment of smell, thirst, appetite loss, nausea, and abdominal pain (Jones, p.773). The Sudafed® website lists these symptoms of catarrh: runny nose, headache, face pains, feeling of mucus in the throat, “a reduced sense of smell and taste, temporary hearing loss and a crackling in [the] ear, and a sore, scratchy throat” (\u0026#34;What is Catarrh\u0026#34;). It is very difficult to find any information about catarrh in a modern sense. These two lists of symptoms are very similar. The main difference is the catarrh mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette was much more extensive (affecting all mucous membranes in the body).\nThe term “catarrh” is mentioned 728 times in all the digitized copies of the Egyptian Gazette. Of the 728 mentions, only four of those mentions were not in advertisements (nearly all of these mentions came from Peruna advertisements but around three came from another patent medicine). One was a sad story about a man suffering from catarrh who committed suicide (not, according to the article, because of the catarrh). The other three mentions remarked about notable personages suffering from catarrh. It seems like the meaning of the disease catarrh changed through the century. Although the term catarrh is uncommon in this region of the world today, when used, it essentially means the same thing it did during the time of the Egyptian Gazette.\nSome additional material that I found is lists of diseases within advertisements. While Peruna concentrated on sickness, Allenburys’ appears to be a company that concentrated on supplements or fortifying food, almost like vitamins today. Allenburys’ advertised itself as a restorative medicine, but also as a preventative diet. The most common version of the advertisement was the one summarized as the “Strength and Stamina” advertisement.\nThe last patent medicine considered in this research is Dr. William’s Pink Pills. The most common ailment the Pills claimed to cure was rheumatism followed by anemia, indigestion, and sciatica. As seen in the image above, it seems almost random which disease the advertisement claims to cure each time.\nI used variations on the following XPath queries to find the data.\n//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;peruna\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][@type=\u0026#34;advert\u0026#34;]/div //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;catarrh\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)][not(@type=\u0026#34;advert\u0026#34;)]/p These queries have problems because the unit [not(@type=\u0026#34;advert\u0026#34;)] is not always reliable. Sometimes a type is not used to define an advertisement. The other difficulty with this research topic is the lack of reliable information on historical illnesses. The reson I chose Peruna, Dr. William’s Pink Pills, and Allenburys’ is they are the most common medicinal advertisements. This topic has many ways to expand upon the small amount of research I completed. Future research could expand upon each disease mentioned in the advertisements. Another idea for future research would be to compare treatment methods of the diseases to modern treatments. This research hardly covered any of the topic. There is much more to discover within the topic of 1900s illnesses and their treatments.\nWorks Cited Jones, C. Handfield. “Catarrh.” The British Medical Journal, vol. 2, no. 143, 1859, pp. 772–76.

Mummies are the remains of humans or animals that have been preserved through specific ceremonial practices, such as removing internal organs and wrapping their bodies with bandages. Growing up in modern Western culture, I was exposed to mummies in museums, history textbooks, and countless movies, TV shows, and books. I never learned about them in-depth, though. Furthermore, they seemed to be exploited for their “creepy” factor rather than their cultural significance. Time and time again, I witnessed mummies portrayed as monsters instead of valuable cultural artifacts.\nAlready faintly accustomed to this unfairness in the representation of Egyptian tradition, I was especially shocked when I realized that after encoding several issues of the Egyptian Gazette, I had not read a single mention of mummies. Based on the stereotypical portrayals of Egyptian culture in Western media, I expected plentiful discussions on mummies in the Gazette. This gap between stereotypical expectations and reality intrigued me; I instantly wanted to know more about mummies and their actual cultural significance beyond what American Hollywood films had led me to believe. With all this in mind, I decided to explore “What was the cultural significance of mummies in the early 20th century?” as my research question. I limited the scope of my findings to the early 20th century to better utilize our course’s repository of Gazette records.\nQueries \u0026amp; Visualizations I began my research with the following X-Path query: //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;mummy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature\nI started with this relatively broad query to find which features had the most frequent mentions of the word “mummy,” or at least to find some sort of other noticeable trend in the word use that could help me narrow my research scope in further queries. Based on the results from this query, I created the following data visualization.\nAs is evident in the graph, the query only yielded eleven issues with features that mentioned the word “mummy.” Based on this number, I inferred that many uses of the word probably occurred in segments of the Gazette that were not labeled as features. Whether this was due to human entry error in our course repository or not, I could tell that this query alone was not fruitful enough to serve as the sole basis for my research. A helpful conclusion I could draw from the results of this query, though, was that mentions of “mummy” occurred at a proportionally higher rate amongst the results on page three of the Gazette issues. This finding was not what I initially had in mind when I used a query focused on features, but I was grateful to have a starting point for the next query. I refined my second query to only search for word mentions on the third page of Gazette issues to see whether this would bring me more results, specifically because this query was not limited to segments labeled as features. My goal was for this next set of results to provide me with a richer variety of information that could help me ultimately answer my research question.\nMy second, more niche query ended up looking like this: //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;]//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;mummy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]\nMuch to my delight, this query yielded thirty-seven articles that mentioned my search term. I created the bar graph below to help me visualize this data and spot any trends.\nIt is worth noting that the visualized data above only portrays a proportion of total mentions of my search term because I confined the query to a specific page number rather than a raw word count. This proportional data, though, was immensely helpful in narrowing down the number of articles I could read that discussed mummies rather than just any Gazette item that happened to use the word “mummy.” Thirty-seven articles were substantial enough to provide me with further insight into the cultural significance of mummies in Egypt at the newspaper’s time while still being a manageable amount of data. Overall, I was pleased with the results of my second XPath query and felt that it provided sufficient material to move from the exploratory to the analytical phase of my project.\nI began my analysis by ascertaining trends in the visualized data above. I found that “mummy” was used the most in 1905 with sixteen mentions, followed by seven in 1906, then a spike to twelve in 1907, and ultimately only two in 1908.

With life almost being centered on the Nile, taking advantage of the annual flooding of the Nile was necessary. Around the 19th century, Muhammad ‘Ali focused on revitalizing farming infrastructure in order to build massive, high efficiency farming systems that could support entire cities with surplus being up for trade. (Johnson 2015) The plan was extremely successful and was then carried on by his successors, leading Egypt to gain an edge in the world of agriculture.\nInterest in control over the Nile’s floods grew from being purely motivated by farming based income and towards influence in Sudan. (Johnson 2015) After utilization of a cleverly placed dam, access to land in Sudan allowed for further expansion of irrigation systems and farmland which in turn boosted agricultural output. Increasing Egyptian yield was not all positive however, due to constant soil usage, soil quality rapidly diminished and pest problems started to grow. Despite agriculture providing a reasonable part of Egypt’s national income, there was a lack of well defined agricultural administration under the Cromer administration. (Johnson 2015) At this point more clear lines were drawn between the purpose of different crops with wheat being primarily for domestic consumption, and cotton being used as an export crop. Due to Egypt’s government being primarily British led, most agricultural policy was geared towards maximizing British income, meaning wheat farming took a backseat to cotton production meant for export. Due to wheat not being a “cash crop” in the same way cotton was, it didn’t continue to expand the same way cotton did as its purpose was mostly domestic. Despite all this however, Egyptians were extremely good at producing wheat, even being cited as being the best in the world at some point. (Gowayed 2009) Because of this, three wheat varieties were primarily grown: Tugari, Mawani, and Middling. Although information on these species of wheat is sparse beyond the context of Egyptian Gazette, what there is information on is prices.\nPictured above is the monthly average of the highs and lows of the three different wheat varieties. Although nothing specifically stands out at first, there are a few abnormalities in the seemingly normal chart. First and foremost, year after year, Mawani wheat consistently outperforms the other two wheat varieties. I did research into why this could be, and found that Mawani wheat was the variety that was often exported, while the other two varieties were more specifically seen as domestic crops meant to feed the population. On top of this, Mawani wheat was subject to price fixing at high costs in order to maximize export income. (Bureau of Statistics 1918) Because of these factors, domestic variants stayed more reasonably priced than the Mawani (Export) variant of wheat. The data is mostly consistent outside of this besides the Mawani variant from July to September. While the two other varieties often dip in that period, Mawani holds strong. I wasn’t able to find any sources directly speaking on it, (in the newspaper and online), but with the understanding the Mawani was an export variety, it would make sense that since wheat can be stored near indefinitely, wheat would be sold in a consistent manner month after month to maintain price by storing surplus in bountiful seasons. Further research into the issue reveals that in late 1907 a group of British soldiers went pigeon hunting, and a stray shot hit and set fire to a village’s wheat supply. From the chart, there is no way to determine whether it affected wheat prices, it does provide valuable insight into the flammability of wheat in Egypt either as a result of how it is stored and/or how climate affects said flammability, proving it to be a real risk worth considering when storing wheat.\nAlthough wheat was always significant throughout the history of Egypt, it did end up taking a backseat to cotton entirely by the start of 1902 due to wheat simply just being unable to keep up economically. Cotton was storable throughout all seasons and demand shot up during winters, giving cotton farmers a target to aim for that wheat farmers simply didn’t have due to lower, more consistent demand over the course of the year. Although wheat and cotton aren’t necessarily competitive goods, as they both serve different purposes, they did compete for the same production space, forcing wheat out of the agricultural spotlight. Wheat suffered at times due to policy often specifically targeting cotton export growth, which hurt wheat due to cotton taking priority. To some degree, because cotton was the more profitable endeavor, this benefitted the wheat industry as it meant the Egyptian locals maintained control of their industry rather than it being entirely dictated by European leaders. The most impactful takeaway from this research is that although wheat fell away …","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"f9275ebc40b04cb4ae0ce2c35d2e4187","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-pazos/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-pazos/","section":"post","summary":"Although agriculture is important in every society, it proved especially important in Egyptian culture.

However, the army was not there to completely take over the territory as with other colonial military operations of the time period. Instead, the occupying force was simply there to ensure that the European economic interests remained secure in a region of great diversity and political instability, with competing interests from the many European colonial empires, the Ottoman Empire from the west, and the native Egyptians. The nation of Egypt was left to be partially autonomous, but the Army of Occupation would remain to keep British interests safe and ensure that Britain’s hold over the government would stay strong.\nMy research seeks to analyze the promotions within this Army of Occupation, as the British military was a substantial part of the daily lives of the Egyptians under imperial subjugation, and the promotions within their ranks were the most commonly reoccuring feature in the Egyptian Gazette that pertains to this topic, and I took a research interest in it.\nIn my initial stages of research, I used simple XPath queries to get a grasp on the basic data I would be working with. I wished to try to see if a pattern could be found, or if any of the initial data stood out for a path for my research to hone in on. I began with queries related to keywords, such as specific ranks and promotions.\n//div[matches(.,\u0026#39;colonel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/head //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;colonel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;corporal\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/head //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;corporal\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;lieutenant\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/head //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;lieutenant\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;promoted\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;promoted\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] I chose to have the headings yielded so I could easily see the main topic of each division, and I would be able to tell easily if an article was unrelated to my research and exclude it before compiling data. I chose to do a secondary query of each yielding the features, so that I could see from a broad perspective how clean my data was. If most of my features had to do with the military or government, I knew that the data was an accurate representation of what my research was looking for.\nI noticed a pattern in the months that the rank “colonel” appeared, and saw that it most often was mentioned in certain months, peaking in October with 14 mentions, then sloping off until rising again in January to 13 mentions, then decreasing again before jumping up to 12 mentions in June, then sloping off and the cycle begins again. This would indicate that military presence in the news is concentrated within certain times of the year, and thus military promotions would be expected to peak in the same time frames.\nI wished to test this theory and narrowed my search to mentions of the words “promotion” and “promoted” within divisions containing the rank of “Lieutenant”. Sure enough, mentions peaked in the same periods of time. This confirmed that promotions tended to be awarded to military officers during specific months, and then become less and less frequent until the next peak.\nI believe that the concentration of military promotions in the army of occupation around these months is due to British army traditions centered around the same time periods. In my research I discovered that the honors, awards, and promotions to officers in the Royal Army were announced in The Gazette, the official public record of the United Kingdom, twice a year. The Gazette reports that after a Royal decree, “With these regular awards came the institution of the Birthday and New Year honours lists, published as supplements to The Gazette. Honours are published in The Gazette twice a year - between May and June on the Queen’s official birthday, and at the New Year”. This explains why the promotions would peak in January and June, as they do in the Egyptian Gazette, as the British heirarchy would be incentivized to give out their intended promotions before they are announced and archived back in London. Also, an extremely popular military parade falls annually in mid-June, known as “Trooping the Colour”, and it would make sense for promotions to be given around this event, as many senior officers and members of the royal family are present.\n“National and Personal Achievements: Military and CI…” The Gazette, https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/national-record-of-achievement.\n","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"e952b2ebd77594c965269d70b8381cb6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-bush/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-bush/","section":"post","summary":"In 1882, the British Empire landed troops in Egypt with backing from the Khedive, and defeated the Egyptian nationalist military.

Sahel is another term used to describe the north coast of Egypt, where the majority of their exports flow through into the Mediterranean. I tracked the exports from the beginning of 1905 to the beginning of 1908, and found some commonalities between the years. The peak of exports seems to be from January to mid-March. This is because the Nile flooded in mid-September, spreading sediment and other nutrients into the farmland that allowed the farmers to grow crops. Wheat tends to take 120-140 days to fully mature, so the wheat would be ready for harvest in the January-February time frame. However, the British started building dams and water resources in 1902 to try and make the farming season year round by providing a consistent source of water. However, the initial Aswan dam was not capable of storing or providing enough water to provide any sustainable amount of farming water so the yearly flood cycle was still the main source of gaining nutrients for farming and providing water for irrigation.\nIn the graph the exports in early 1906 are unrivaled, with a weekly peak at over 120k ardebs. However, the weeks prior to that week are underwhelming compared to other years, so I believe that something limited exports during those times and that caused the week after whatever event to have hyperinflated export numbers. Compared to 1906, 1907 has much lower export numbers. This can be tied to the Denshawai Incident, where a flare up of violence between Egyptian villagers and British soldiers led to more of the Egyptian population turning to nationalism and seeing cooperation with the British as not possible. This translates into farmers being less willing to export large sums of wheat, and instead keeping and selling it within the country or to export it in other ways that do not go to European countries, therefore not going by boat through the North of Egypt. The middle part of 1906, where a straight line is present, is a portion where either no newspapers have been uploaded or they do not have export charts with them. I cannot find any outside resources to help give any insight into what the export numbers may have looked like.\nCulturally and historically wheat has been extremely important to the Egyptian way of life. The Ancient Egyptians would farm and sustain themselves off wheat, and mastered farming it. They understood the Nile’s flooding cycle, irrigation, and storage amongst all the other things. This major emphasis however has made Egypt the eye of many large empires. Originally, the Romans took over Egypt and used it to feed their Empire. The Romans saw Egypt as so important that they allowed them to continue having a Pharaoh to try and maintain the peace in order to milk grain out to feed Rome. This is no different than Muhammad Ali Pasha, who modernized Egypt to become a massive cotton producer. However, Egypt could not produce cotton 24/7, so they also grew wheat in the cotton off-season, and lived and sold this wheat.\nOverall, through my research and the analysis of my quantitative data, I gained a stronger understanding of not only the export and farming patterns of Egypt in the early 20th century, but also the cultural effect of the production of wheat throughout Egyptian history into the modern times. The introduction of water reservoirs and dams, such as the creation of development of the Suez Canal and Aswan Dam amongst other water conservation and distribution sources, has had a massive effect on the growing capabilities of Egypt, as well as the amount of work farmers have to do. The average farmer in the 1900’s had to work year round, compared to pre-colonization workers that only worked one cycle as they had work for sustainment opposed to profit. The introduction of cotton farming as a profit driven business also led to workers having to work more, and work harder. This led to Egypt decreasing their wheat production in favor of growing and selling raw cotton to processing mills throughout Europe and using the profit to prop up their economy.\nOutside Source Foaden. “Text-Book of Egyptian Agriculture, Ed. by G.

We analyzed the frequency at which 14 different diseases were mentioned in the Gazette from January 1905 to December 1907 and compared the results to how recently the disease had been discovered for the people in this time. In order to collect the data on how often specific illnesses were referenced, our group employed the use of both target word searches in the content repository as well as tailored XPath queries. The queries focused on finding mentions of the different diseases. We accounted for spelling differences such as with smallpox by performing multiple queries per disease when necessary (ex. “smallpox” and “small pox”). These word searches produced an information set that revealed mentions by month of Pneumonia, Epilepsy, Smallpox, Yellow fever, Aneurysm, Heart disease, Stroke, Cholera, Bilharzia, Enteritis, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, and Influenza.\nFor the plague, we used the XPath //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;plague\u0026#39; ,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/*[not(matches(.,\u0026#39;cattle\u0026#39;))]/*[not(matches(.,\u0026#39;locust\u0026#39;))]/head. This specific XPath is designed to find how often Headlines containing the word “plague” are found in the Egyptian Gazette. Not only that, but because we are looking for Sapien incidents, the XPath excluded instances where cattle or locusts were addressed in conjunction with “plague”.\nOne reason we chose the diseases mentioned in this analysis project is because of their application to our projects. However, we also primarily focused our attention on more commonly known diseases of the time, such as plague, cholera, and tuberculosis. We also included data on illnesses like stroke and heart disease in conjunction with contagious diseases. Furthermore, we considered epilepsy as a potential data point but discovered that the newspaper only mentioned it twice. Therefore, our work is not comprehensive of all diseases mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette, but it attempts to cover a variety of common and uncommon diseases occurring during that era.\nOnce the data on each disease was collected, it was organized into a list of dates detailing when they were mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette. The data was then separated by month and placed into two bar charts to visualize our findings. One reveals how many mentions there are of the individual diseases each month and separates the findings by color for comparative clarity. The second chart shows the total count of “new diseases” compared to “old diseases” from 1905 to 1907.\nFor the sake of this analysis, “new diseases” are considered anything discovered within the last century of the Egyptian Gazette articles being written. “Old diseases” on the other hand are the remaining illnesses, chronic or acute, claimed to have been discovered before the 19th century. This classification system was created to be based on how the readers and authors of the Gazette would have thought of the diseases. While we today may think of diseases like tuberculosis and typhoid as old since they are no longer common, it is important to remember that they were relatively new for the time period in which the Gazette was written.\nThat said, several of the diseases we are analyzing have documentation dating back to a thousand years or more before the Egyptian Gazette was written. For clarity purposes, the first “documentation” of a disease is defined as the first time it was mentioned in recorded history.\nHippocrates recorded the symptoms of a stroke and pneumonia during his lifetime, which was from 460-370 BC (Nilsen and Imogen). Aneurysm, smallpox, and plague were discovered between 100 AD and 600 AD in the order listed (Livesay, “History of Smallpox”, and “plague”). The first record of influenza was an epidemic in 1173 AD and yellow fever began in the Americas during the 1500s (Shimizu and “yellow fever”). The origin of the concept of heart disease is a bit vague, but in 1768, a speech was given about coronary artery disease (“History of Heart Attack”). Cholera also has an obscure history because reports of a disease with similar symptoms existed in India thousands of years before the first documentation of it in 1817 (“cholera”). In 1851, Bilharz found the cause of bilharzia (parasitic worms). A few years later in 1880, the source of typhoid was discovered (specific bacteria) (Barakat and Marinelli). Tuberculosis was discovered by Dr. Robert Koch in 1854 when he first isolated the bacteria which causes it. Enteritis was the most recently classified disease (1850-1900) discussed in the Egyptian Gazette (Kirsner). Despite all these reports, unfortunately, sometimes this date is vague and uncertain, and often information about the disease was verbally imparted to the next generation.\nThe data reveals that the most commonly mentioned disease was the Plague, with the second most common being cholera.

Not only that, but because I am looking for sapient incidents, the XPath excluded instances where cattle or locusts were mentioned in conjunction with “plague”.\nThe XPath, along with the word search, produced results that revealed an annual spike in the Egyptian Gazette’s mentions of the term plague along with repeated occurrences of the influx from 1905-1906. As illustrated in the chart below, the Egyptian Gazette contains headlines with the word “plague” almost twice as many times between early summer to early fall months compared to in the winter and spring. Curious to see if there were any correlations to explain this phenomenon, I conducted a simple word search through the content repository to find how many times “disease” was mentioned in the newspaper. Because of the extensive use of this term, my query yielded significantly more results than when looking for plague headlines. However, the mentions of disease seemed to follow a similar pattern to those of the plague. While it is not as dramatic of a fluctuation, the subtle increase and decrease in the references to disease seem to correspond with the plague’s annual influx. This phenomenon led me to wonder: Why are there significantly more occurrences of the word “plague” being mentioned in one part of the year than in the other?\nUnfortunately, there are challenges with answering this question. For one, not a lot of information is given on the Plague in Egypt between 1905-1907, and most data on disease cases refer to European and American studies. Furthermore, a wide range of factors potentially explains why the Plague was talked about more during one half of the year than the other. Public perceptions, case numbers, weather, or even shipping movements could all contribute to the Egyptian Gazette’s decision to increase or decrease their mentions of the Plague.\nTo fully understand the importance of these mentions in an Alexandrian newspaper, one must first understand the context of the term “plague.” In the Egyptian Gazette, the term “plague” is often synonymous with “Bubonic Plague”. The bubonic plague is caused by a highly infectious bacterium called Yersinia Pestis. This disease, normally transmitted by fleas on rats, causes fever-like symptoms in victims that can escalate to swollen and painful lymph nodes and even death. Throughout history, there have been several instances when plague epidemics have erupted, most infamously being the Black Death in 1346–1353.\nThat said, 92.9% of the mentions of the Plague were on page three of the Egyptian Gazette. I found this information by applying the XPath //div[matches(.,\u0026#39;disease\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] to find the date, page, and section identifier for every occurrence of the word plague in the Egyptian Gazette. This abundance of mentions on page three is because 329 of the 380 mentions of the Plague (not just headlines), between January 1905 and January 1908, were found in the “Local and General” section of the newspaper.\nThis is relevant because page three is typically the first page in the Egyptian Gazette that does not primarily contain advertisements. Therefore, if a reader wanted non-advertised information, they would likely turn to page three first. Furthermore, the “Local and General” section of the Gazette is normally the first column on page three. Therefore, these contents are placed optimally to be most noticed and read by the newspaper’s subscribers. Even more, plague information would have been highly relevant to the people of Alexandria due to the risk associated with diseases in major cities.\nA research article published by The Royal Society illustrates European case numbers of the plague during the early 20th century. Their findings support the idea of plague epidemics being pervasive in highly populated regions such as coastal or inland port cities. The data revealed Europe was recovering from a major outbreak of the Plague in 1899, in which 250 cases were recorded. However, this number dropped to less than 20 by 1903. Most of the cases were recorded in coastal and inland port cities such as London, Liverpool, and Marseille. Since Alexandria is also a major port city with heavy traffic between these sites, Egypt would likely have been concerned with outbreaks in its own cities, especially in the wake of a major European Pandemic. Furthermore, cities such as London and Liverpool are listed in the Egyptian Gazette as frequent areas of “special outside dispatches” under the Exterieur section of the Newspaper.\nimage from Bramanti, Dean, Walløe and Stenseth (2019) image from Bramanti, Dean, Walløe and Stenseth (2019) However, despite concerns over plague outbreaks, European case numbers were significantly low between 1902 and 1909. …","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"75b95ee57f867b91f9894cf3bf9e30fb","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-damato/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-damato/","section":"post","summary":"In preparing for my analysis project, I ran the XPath Query: //div[matches(.,'plague', 'i')]/*[not(matches(.,'cattle'))]/*[not(matches(.,'locust'))]/head\nThis specific XPath is designed to find how often headlines containing the word “plague\" are found in the Egyptian Gazette.","tags":null,"title":"Plague Mentions in the Egyptian Gazette","type":"post"},{"authors":["Rainey Sharrow"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Introduction and Research Question When I began the research process, I was fascinated by the passion behind the Letters to the Editor Section. There were vile arguments about political views, people contradicting articles previously published, people offering a unique perspective, and people professing their undying support. This variety left me with many questions. After a difficult research process, I am setting out to answer a complicated question: What is the purpose of the letters to the editor section in the Egyptian Gazette? The answer combines qualitative and quantitative research to tackle this question from the perspective of the newspaper and the writers.\nQueries and Visualizations My question changed a lot over the course of the process. I initially pursued the newspaper’s opinion of the letter to the editor section, but that led to vague, unquantifiable results. So I endeavored to gather why the newspaper published the letters and why people wrote the letters. My original jumping off point was to find out what was discussed in the Letters to the Editor section. I started with the following Xpath query:\n//div[@feature=\u0026#34;letters\u0026#34;]//head\nThis pulled the headling of every Letter to the Editor feature that was in the Egyptian Gazette. I then copied and pasted the contents of every section in 1904 into a word cloud generator.\nOnce I understood a little bit about what was generally talked about in this feature, I looked at the relationship between the date a letter was submitted to the paper and the turnover until it was published. I sought to identify the opposition or support of the newspaper, then compare the delay time between the two. Would it take shorter or longer for a positive letter to get published than a negative letter? What does that mean about the intentions of the newspaper? I set out to find my answer. I searched for the Xpath query:\n//div[@feature=\u0026#34;letters\u0026#34;]//dateline This query scans the Egyptian Gazette repository and looks for the dateline within every section of the Letters to the Editor feature. The query drew 122 results, and I could begin the tedious reading process. I had to identify opposition and support. As I read, I created an identification system and labeled each position behind the letter as a complaint, support, or expert. I labeled these based on the tone, style, and material the letter covered. The more I read, the more I realized it might have been more effective to identify the topic that the letter covered (ex. politics, sports, socioeconomics, asking questions, complaining about public facilities, reporting concerning incidents). If I had categorized data by content, I could have found more results regarding the purpose of the letters section. Instead, I used position labels, dates of release, and the date of the letter. This allowed me to produce an initial visualization.\nI was ecstatic to see the upward trends, but I wanted more than what this visualization presented. I saw each position but wanted to complete a deeper comparison to see if there were any trends I was missing. I went back to the data and added a column for the delay (in days) between the date the letters were written and published. This numerical measure added complexity to the graph and allowed me to compare each position’s submission date more closely.\nThis visualization shows trends in release dates of the Letters to the Editor section of the Egyptian Gazette. The graph on top shows the date the letter was written and the date it was released for each position. The graphs overlaps, so the positions that skew low or high are observable. The lower graph depicts each letter, whether it supports, complains, or is an expert, and the time in days between writing and publishing that letter. This allows me to delve deeper into my quantitative research and make conclusions.\nInterpreting Data and Supplementary Information With this complete visualization, I began using this quantitative data to explain the purpose of the letters to the editor section for the newspaper. The bottom graph of my finalized visualization is very sprawling. The data seems inconclusive; however, the letters that offer an expert opinion have less universalized delay times. The results vary from 0 to 33 days. This is more sprawling than any support or complaint of the paper. Since many expert opinions were less time sensitive and referenced their unique perspective, it was slower to publish for the newspaper. I expected a big difference between the delay times of support and complaints. I thought the newspaper would want more positive feedback rather than negative feedback included in the paper. The results showed more complaints than supportive letters, and the two positions overlapped in delay times. There were no conclusive results about the turnover from being written to published. This surprised me, and I did some qualitative research to understand how this makes sense.\nAs I read the letters to the editor section, I …","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"51ce0fd2738892ad84d2130b3c08ba45","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-sharrow/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-sharrow/","section":"post","summary":"A closer look at the letters to the editor section and a deeper analysis of the delay between submission and release dates.","tags":["letters","dates","editor","qualitative","quantitative"],"title":"Analysis of The Letter to the Editor Section of The Egyptian Gazette","type":"post"},{"authors":["Rainey Sharrow"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":" Caption Introduction As I began the research process, I constantly ran into information about various plagues: specifically the Bubonic Plague. What appeared less frequently, however, was cattle plague. Upon seeing an excerpt on page 3 of the 1904-12-16 issue of The Egyptian Gazette, I delved deeper. What is “bovine typhus” and why was it important to the readers of The Egyptian Gazette?\nRinderpest The Cattle Plague, also known as Rinderpest, entered Africa in the 1880s most likely from the shipment of cattle from Arabia or Bombay. Many Egyptians urged the government to take action against this through trade restrictions; however, the Egyptian government needed to import cattle to have enough for the country. Instead, the government set up a quarantine site for any cattle and sheep entering the country. Despite their efforts, the plague entered Egypt in 1903 due to a lack of knowledge about the symptoms in bovine.\nThe epidemic’s effects were disastrous in Egypt. Symptoms included diarrhea, high fever, oral erosions, lymphoid necrosis, etc. Many cattle met their demise. According to The Egyptian Gazette, as of 1904-12-16, an estimated 146,649 cattle had died from the plague. This explains the significance of the coverage in the newspaper. It is important to the readers of the paper to understand the status of the cattle plague so they can keep their bovine healthy.\nThe Egyptian Gazette I became curious about what section of The Egyptian Gazette the cattle plague appeared in most frequently, so I ran a simple Xpath Query.\n//div[matches(., \u0026#39;cattle plague\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/@feature\nThis searched for the term “cattle plague” within any feature of The Egyptian Gazette. It returned 68 hits, and I found that the cattle plague appeared most in the Local and General sections of the paper.\nadditional links https://ia800708.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/22/items/crossref-pre-1909-scholarly-works/10.1016%252Fs0368-1742%252804%252980032-8.zip\u0026amp;file=10.1016%252Fs0368-1742%252805%252980072-4.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670074.1960.11665255?journalCode=teaf19 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8901-7_1 https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-vazquez/ https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-medina/ ","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"42b007e4dff98ae105a44fd135778415","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-11-29-sharrow/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-11-29-sharrow/","section":"post","summary":"There has been an uptick in the cases of Cattle Plaque.

Both wheat and barley were used for beer and bread. The period we are studying specifically in the Egyptian Gazette is after this switch of crop occurred. Grains such as wheat and barley were still significant to the economic growth of Egypt. However, they were not as significant when the agricultural trends of Egypt shifted. In my individual research, I want to examine what the difference in cost and production of barley and wheat were. With this comparison, I think I will be able to answer the question of which grain was more useful and valuable to the people during this time period. I also plan to learn what the economic state was during this time and how it related to grain usage.\nThe economic growth of Egypt increased significantly under Cromer’s rule. Foreign trade was a specific aspect that increased. The grain exports slowly decreased during this time. According to the author Jeffery G. Collins, “Egypt’s other traditional exports, wheat, barley, maize, rice and beans, shrank or shifted entirely into import items while cigarettes remained the only manufactured product of any importance among exports”(Page 37, “The Egyptian Elite under Cromer 1882-1907: 1882-1907). These trends proved to be a worthy change in agriculture since foreign trade was increasing economic growth.\nEven though there was a huge increase in foreign trade, Egypt was still in a lot of debt. Their public debt rates went down after 1897, but the private debt increased beginning in 1903. These debts fluctuated several times during 1903-1907. Egypt’s government also had a lot of debt to pay to the Ottomans. According to Collins, “Egypt’s massive cotton exports served largely to pay tribute to the Ottomans, service the staggering interest on the debt sand even reduce the debt, though much of the reduction was also due to the sale of former royal lands” (Page 39). The shifts in agriculture production were intended to increase economic prosperity and to repair the economy’s weak spots, meaning the large debts that had interest rates adding even more to them yearly. This shows that the change in production of grain was essential since it was not as desired as crops like cotton. In the Egyptian Gazette during the time period we are studying, the switch of agricultural trends already occurred. What the newspaper reports are the effects of these changes. Both the newspaper and this book prove that the shift was needed for Egypt’s economic growth. Looking at barley and wheat specifically, it is obvious that wheat is the more desired grain of the two. In fact, overall wheat was the most desired grain.\nResearch I began my individual research with the XPath search of:\n//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema01”]//cell[contains(.,‘Barley’)]/following-sibling::cell[2]/measure This gave me the change in price of barley over time. While I was doing the data for this specific topic, I noticed a trend in the cost. It usually stayed in the 70s. But the Maximum price listed was 110, and the minimum was 65. The raw data turned out to be over 200 items, so I will not be including that in my research paper. I then did a similar search to find the prices of wheat, but I did change how I phrased it so it would make more sense to me. I used the XPath below for wheat prices:\n//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema01”]//row[1]/cell[3]/measure\nWith the two tables of prices, I was able to compare the differences and similarities. I will discuss these later on in the data visualization section. Another aspect that I wanted to research was the differences and similarities in production rates. I used the following XPaths to get this information:\n//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema02”]//row[4]/cell[3]/measure //table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema02”]//row[1]/cell[3]/measure\nThe raw data that I got from each of these queries are two long to list in the paper, otherwise I would have added this to the research section. Data Visualization As seen in the visual above, wheat cost a significant amount more than barley. On average, wheat cost around 110-120 pts, while barley costed around 70 pts.\nAs seen above, wheat on average was produced in quantities of thousands of ards. Barley is barely produced at 1,000 ards.\nConclusion Wheat was a more desirable grain than barley, which made it more expensive and produced in larger quantities. These two crops were not produced nearly as much as the crops that were exported to other countries. The economical growth for Egypt depended on foreign trade so other crops such as cotton were produced more in order to meet the financial needs. While the trade of cotton managed to put a dent into the debt owed by Egypt to the Ottomans, grain remained a subtle but useful good.\nWorks cited “The Egyptian Elite under Cromer 1882-1907.” Google Books, Google, …","date":1669680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669680000,"objectID":"caeca49366547c6246065e8eeffb85ad","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-casimiro/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-casimiro/","section":"post","summary":"Background Grain was an important crop in Egypt for a long period of time before cotton took over.

Egyptian wheat production was a massively important part of the day to day life of Egypt for millennia, from the days of the Pharaoh to the 19th century. Wheat was the main subsistence crop throughout the Nile Delta, and allowed the Egyptians to be wildly successful and allowed them autonomy even when they were conquered. Wheat’s staple status primarily came through its use in the production of both bread and beer. This was shown in the Roman conquest of Egypt, where they were granted autonomy from Rome until Cleopatra took Mark Antony’s side in the last war of the Roman Republic. The major importance of Egypt being the wheat basket of the Mediterranean allowed it and its ruling parties power and independence. This all came to an end under Muhammad Ali Pasha, who through large irrigation projects and the change to cotton based farming led Egypt to become a more economic power instead of sustainance based farming. This led to Egypt becoming less dependent on wheat and more dependent on the economic benefits of selling cotton and using the profit to buy food and develop the country overall.\nGovernment influence The government had a variety of programs to increase agriculture. One of the main crops they pushed was the production of wheat. One of the programs was the Cairo Agricultural show; this was an opportunity for the grower to show off their wheat production to potential buyers. It was a great networking event for many people. The Suez canal was a significant government transportation portal for the exporting of wheat. Great Britain exported most of Egypt’s wheat, leaving little for the people: “as little as 1/5 of the wheat was kept for the people” (Egyptian Gazette). The 1/5 portion was processed into other products such as bread. This policy of increasing economic revenue was done with a little more of a selfish nature rather than helping the individual farmer. However, to make up for this selfish nature, the government had to deal with the crime of people stealing each other’s crops and took these cases very seriously.\nOver time, controversy began to grow about whether wheat or cotton was more profitable. The British saw wheat as mainly a single-dimensional product that was only for flour production. The big cash crop was cotton due to the greater demand during the US civil war and greater transferability. This is mentioned throughout the article “British flour for Egypt” in the Egyptian Gazette. Although the British thought this, they still did a lot to help increase the production of wheat; in the Egyptian Gazette, the feature “abridged prospectus” explained the process of purchasing the land and how the process was meant to incentivize people to buy and start cultivating the wheat crop. The most popular land was lower Egypt which had the rich soil to grow good wheat. The process of securing land could get a little complicated, but there was a program to help poorer people get their foot in the door. Through this program, you could buy a share of land and make payments. However, if you miss only one payment, your entire land could be revoked. These payments could be expensive, especially with the hefty tax you pay to auditors. This extreme policy really pressured farmers to produce most of the crops. This excessive production made local articles such as “Khartoum’s wheat crop” describe wheat as a very profitable crop since it was written from the local perspective.\nIn addition, the Egyptian Gazette has an article called “British Flour,” which was written in March 4, 1907. Throughout this text, the author talks about the shift from wheat production to more cotton production due to its further profitability. So, the government shifted focus and realized money was better than extra production. The article details how as wheat increased, the demand and sales remained the same, and the primary consumers were the British Mill, which had its own competition with the French miller for being a top supplier. Our second visual below about wheat prices displays how although foreign governments such as the British didn’t increase their wheat purchase during March of 1907, wheat remained at a steady price due to Egypt’s ability to distribute the extra grain elsewhere. This displays wheat’s ability to have stable and growing production and how it was an essential part of commerce, even though government support was shifting.\nResearch We initially decided to find out how often wheat was mentioned in each feature within the Egyptian gazette. This piece of information would show how relevant this specific crop is and what times during the year that it is being discussed.

The first fire occurred on Saturday at 2 p.m. at a tobacconist on Attarin-street. The second fire occurred at a second tobacconist. This time it was at 2 a.m. Monday morning on Munet el-Bassal. The third fire occurred only an hour later at a grocer’s shop in Attarin-street. Fortunately, the fires only caused slight damages and no one died.\nThe frequency of these fires is quite strange, mainly because it is winter when these fires occurred. This wouldn’t stand out as much in the summer because in the summer it would be easy to “cause a fire by heat from the sun”. Another strange part about this article is that it doesn’t mention the cause of the fires. The paper also dedicated a relatively small part of the paper for what is a significant story. Even if those fires in particular didn’t cause much damage, it is likely that if the causes are not identified then more fires will continue to occur. If the causes are identified, however, then precautions can be made in order to prevent the fires from occuring. It is also clear that these fires are not an isolated incident because the advertisements about fire insurance are rampant in the Egyptian Gazette.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/07/25/shedding-light-on-alexandrias-firefighting-past/a458884e-fcd2-45e9-a09f-0d4cb5c66d9a/ Fires_of_Alexandria A_History_of_the_Relief_Truck_and_Engine 18-blog-clark ","date":1668816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668816000,"objectID":"86b471211d012368a4a0cc4098924952","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-11-19-combs/","publishdate":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-11-19-combs/","section":"post","summary":"In only two days three fires occured.","tags":["Fire","burning"],"title":"Fires In Alexandria","type":"post"},{"authors":["Fiona Dininger"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"As in all newspapers, the Egyptian Gazette is no stranger to reporting on disease cases. From 1905-1907, the Gazette mentions various diseases 1,688 times. Despite this large figure, the specific breakdown of which diseases are mentioned more often than others reveals a vast inequality in the amount of mentions per disease. To gather this data, I performed several Xpath queries to determine the number of mentions of different diseases in the Gazette, both in total and over time.\n//div[matches(.,’plague’, ‘i’)] //div[matches(.,’bilharzia’, ‘i’)] //div[matches(.,’pneumonia’, ‘i’)] //div[matches(.,’small pox’, ‘i’)] //div[matches(.,’tuberculosis’, ‘i’)] //div[matches(.,’cholera’, ‘i’)] This contrast in mentions is immediately obvious upon viewing the data, and raises several questions of why the Gazette chose its content in this way. This analysis will attempt to explain these disparities in context of when the Gazette was written, and who it was written for.\nTotal mentions of many of the diseases in the Gazette. Total mentions of many of the diseases in the Gazette by month over time. Founded in 1880, the Egyptian Gazette was a newspaper written by British citizens who had moved to Egypt. Early on, it “became the mouthpiece for British policy in Egypt” and was heavily monitored by Lord Cromer, the British Controller-General (Carcanague). Cromer had a large role in the control of the Gazette, and it is suspected that he personally subsidized the Gazette. As Controller-General, Cromer was responsible for the administration of Egypt while under British control from 1883-1907 (Lockman).\nAll this to say that the Egyptian Gazette was a distinctly British entity, written by the British, for the British, and containing British opinions. The reason why this is important is that the motivations of the authors of the Gazette are directly related to their audience: British subjects. As emphasized in journalism, one of the key hallmarks of success in the news industry is to know your audience, and write about issues that they have an interest in (Santiago). In the case of the Gazette, this means that they were tasked with writing about issues that their fellow British subjects in Egypt were interested in, all while keeping in line with Cromer’s interests.\nThe importance of the audience of the Gazette is crucial to understanding the disparities between which diseases they featured in their issues. Since it was written for British citizens, one can assume that they tended to focus on diseases that tended to impact that population the most. This assumption is not made blindly; it is supported by a comparison of the disease mentions to actual cases during this time period.\nOne of the largest cases of the gap between cases and coverage pertains to the disease bilharzia. In her chapter analysis “Cruel Summer,” historian Jennifer Derr provides an account focusing on the prevalence of parasitic diseases, and how new methods of agriculture caused them to become quite common in society (Derr). One of the principal diseases caused by these parasites was schistosomiasis, or as it was referred to in the 1900s, bilharzia. One of the key takeaways from Derr is just how widespread these parasites were in Egypt in this time period, with her stating that the “majority of the populations with regions with access to perennial irrigation” were afflicted. This issue was not something unknown to wider Egypt either; as early as 1838, Italian physician Angelo Dubini identified parasitic worms in the autopsies of Egyptians. These discoveries eventually morphed into scientific investigations of this issue as the 1800s progressed, even getting attention from the Sanitary Department. Derr’s analysis establishes two facts critical to the disparities in attention of diseases: bilharzia was very widespread during this time period and it had been identified as a disease decades prior.\nBecause of these facts, one might wonder why bilharzia is only mentioned in the Gazette a measly four times over the course of 1905-1907 as revealed by an Xpath query. A potential answer to this issue relates back to the audience of the Gazette. While bilharzia was extremely widespread, it was primarily found among Egyptian agricultural workers spending their time in wet, irrigated fields where the parasites easily spread. Since we have already established that the audience of the Gazette would not have been these workers, it stands to reason that it was neglected due to being seen as an Egyptian problem. Compare the 4 mentions of bilharzia to the 1,270 mentions of the plague. Being that the disease killed ⅓ of Europe in the 1300s, all Europeans were quite familiar with the risk of the plague and the knowledge that it was highly contagious. While it certainly did see a high case number during this period, bilharzia did as well, and yet received 318% fewer mentions. This suggests that the audience of the Gazette had a much higher interest in reading about plague than …","date":1668643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668643200,"objectID":"aa1a93ee3ed24cf50d543c2222f9833b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-dininger/","publishdate":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-analysis-dininger/","section":"post","summary":"While the _Gazette_ does frequently mention diseases, there are huge differences in how often different diseases are mentioned.

The captain and the head member of the ship were arrested shortly after. Why is the Egyptian government now prohibiting the transporting and usage of coal? Is this just Egypt preventing the use of coal? Coal is not useful anymore?\nEgyptian government officials watched their country become dirty, barren, and inhabitable as companies and industries became comfortable abusing coal to make energy. Coal was the primary source of energy for North African countries and cities across Europe for most of the century. Coal lit the homes of millions. However, after Thomas Edison proved that energy can be created via other more sustainable power sources, other countries wanted to implement similar mechanisms to help preserve their environment and prevent coal industries from gaining too much power.\nThe public had enough as well with the rise of better work environments and laws. Coal miners with the worst of the environments to work in became enthralled and wanted revenge against the corporate suits running their lives. Strikes across Europe and North Africa became a weekly occurrence. According to an article titled “Outsourcing: Energy and Empire in the Age of Coal” from the Cambridge University Press, “As in 1908 and earlier, the possibility of systematic transnational influence was always on the table. Even when investigations proved that strikes were not precipitated by “foreign agitators,” more subtle transregional mechanisms were at work. Consider a November 1910 strike of about one thousand coal heavers in the Port of Istanbul, who explicitly took advantage of the leverage afforded them by the situation in Ereģli and in England”. Coal had become the forbidden fruit for energy production, and Egypt decided to avoid the possibility of strikes and carnage in the city of Cairo despite neighboring countries such as Germany sticking with it.\nCameron Greco explores the prices changes and international feelings in her website entry posted back in April of 2017. “In January of 1905, coal prices were at 27.3 Shgs. per ton, and by the end of the recorded coal data, in September of 1906, the prices were at a steady level of 34 Shgs” states Cameron referring to the drastic increase in price of coal in Egypt. Coal was all the rage and all anyone could think about was producing more with little disregard for the environment.

This interested me because nowadays, scurvy does not happen in prison even though some prisons don’t serve the most nutritious of foods. This made me wonder how bad the food must have been in the prisons in terms of nutrition, Which led me to question how prisoners were being fed but got so little nutrition that they developed scurvy. From the sources I looked into, namely Rudolph Peters’ Triumphant Prison(2002), Egypt had a very developed prison system for its time, however as Rudolph Peters finds in his 2004 dive into Egyptian prison conditions, he argues it was mainly focused on punishment rather than rehabilitation. I also found that despite having a pretty thoroughly developed legal system, there was a large emphasis on finding revenge rather than reaching a fair conclusion, often being used as justification for the horrible treatment of prisoners. When taking all this into consideration especially seeing the state of law enforcement as discussed in Kenneth Hills’ analysis of Egyptian law enforcement, prisoners were most likely treated as second-class citizens. This makes me think that the prisoners that developed scurvy had most likely lost some sort of food privileges, such as fresh vegetables or other sources of Vitamin C. By the 1900’s, the causes and prevention of scurvy were well known, so no one actually died from getting it, and the worst of the cases were mild. Overall, from my research with supporting information from Shaneze Douglas’ analysis of execution of Egyptian law against foreigners, finds that prisons in Egypt were far from the worst that the world had, and the prisoners had medical care and some rights and were not left to die.\n","date":1666828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666828800,"objectID":"6d2d223810030dd58490f69042bb9e65","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-27-pazos/","publishdate":"2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-27-pazos/","section":"post","summary":"A Scurvy outbreak across prisons in Egypt calls into question treatment of prisoners in Egypt.","tags":["Scurvy","Prison"],"title":"Prison Scurvy","type":"post"},{"authors":["Annie Kryvorutsky"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"On Saturday, December 31, 1904, the Egyptian Gazette dedicated a section in the newspaper to announce the future arrival of the third division of the Baltic Fleet at Port Said. It was implied that high precautionary measures were taken along the Canal when the second division passed through it, and it was noted that measures will still be taken, but they won’t be as extensive with the third division passing.\nI found it curious that the Egyptian Gazette found this information so much more important than the other information it notes about the Baltic Fleet, as this was one of the rare inclusions of the Baltic Fleet that was put into its own section rather than in the telegrams section. However, looking deeper into it, I found that it makes sense that the newspaper prioritized this information, since there was clear wariness and hesitancy about Russia on Britain’s end. Russia was seen as a great world power, and “aroused suspicion and fear in England.” Russia was even cautioned to not make any attacks on the Canal earlier in 1877, which it slightly violated in 1904, during the time when the Baltic Fleets were passing through the Suez on the way to battle Japan. Great Britain was even more wary during this time since Japan was their ally, and the nation was on risky terms with Russia already. While getting coal to fuel the ships journey back to Russia, one vessel used the coal in “overhauling neutral ships near the entrance to the canal.” This was a direct violation of the Convention of 1888, which forbade acts of hostility in the Suez Canal.\nFurthermore, the Suez Canal played a large role for the Russians during the Russo-Japanese War time. For one, it served as a passage for the Russians to get to Japanese territory quicker and more efficiently, allowing them to rest and fuel up during their journey. Moreover, it served as an easier means of providing reinforcement to vessels, such as when Admiral Rozhestvensky’s ship sunk near Madagascar.\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/War_in_the_Far_East/C8sNAAAAIAAJ?hl=en\u0026amp;gbpv=0\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Japan_Weekly_Mail/SyZCAQAAMAAJ?hl=en\u0026amp;gbpv=1\u0026amp;dq=baltic+fleet+suez+canal\u0026amp;pg=RA1-PA655\u0026amp;printsec=frontcover\nhttps://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-arenas/\n","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"aecb2e74be8bbdff7f487ff4f7b70061","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-24-kryvorutsky/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-24-kryvorutsky/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette emphasizes that precautions will be taken during the passing of the third squadron of the Baltic Fleet in 1904.

August 2, 1798 marked the day that the battle was won by the British Navy. This victory was so important to the British, as it secured their position in controlling the Mediterranean seas. Since this win was seen as such a prominent event, the celebrations continued even years after it took place. This battle was just one among many, but was the specific event that ensured that the British overpowered the French. This fleet was led by Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who was recognized as a hero after this took place. This was his first admirable victory of three. Nelson is the one who made the decision to head directly to Alexandria, ultimately, causing them to be able to cut off the French fleet that was heading more towards the coast of Crete. Despite all the troubles he went through, he was able to observe their route and make a move to overtake them. Since this victory arose out of a time that seemed to have no hope, it was even more exciting to the British. This is why it was extremely celebrated after it occurred, especially as this was seen as Napoleon’s first real defeat.\nHoliday Celebrations\n","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"83ff0dfbf0bdeea414c8d183e0c0959a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-24-seaner/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-24-seaner/","section":"post","summary":"An annual celebration","tags":["Nile","battle","Egypt","British"],"title":"Battle of the Nile Victory","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elena Beggs"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":" In the “Local and General” section of The Egyptian Gazette, different articles on death occur often. While others have researched the plague or cholera, I was intrigued by the term sudden death. The “Local and General” and “Personal and Social” sections of the Egyptian Gazette mentions sudden death many times. Typically, the news reports about sudden deaths give information about a random person. This is an example from a 1905 issue of the Egyptian Gazette, “Mustafa Mohamed el Deep, a native butcher of 50 years of, suddenly fell dead in a tramcar yesterday. His death is reported to been caused by heart failure” (1905-10-12, “Sudden Death”). Historically, how much information did the medical community have in the early 1900s concerning sudden death?\nIn 1908, Theodore Fisher, M.D., F.R.C.P. published a book titled The Heart and Sudden Death. This publication presents an abundance of information about the heart and heart diseases. The book describes aneurisms, alcoholism and the heart, and many more topics.\nMost of the stories in the Egyptian Gazette that have a diagnosis fall into the category of heart failure, heart disease, or natural causes. Some other causes included ruptured aneurisms and apoplexy. The definition of apoplexy according to A Dictionary of Medical Science published in 1903 is: “interstitial hemorrhage; effusion of blood occurring suddenly into the substance of an organ or tissue, as the brain, lung, etc.” This definition also makes clear that apoplexy is not cerebral hemorrhage which accounted for the cause of one of the deaths recorded in the Egyptian Gazette.\nAlthough the reports of sudden death in the Egyptian Gazette seem slightly out of place to modern readers, it must have been important to the colonists then. Medical knowledge was expanding rapidly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, for example, in 1901 Karl Landsteiner discovered different blood types. At this point in time, physicians knew a great deal about the causes of heart disease although they knew little about how to prevent it.\n","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b9f54261907dd285fe04d9b07745e776","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-24-beggs/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-24-beggs/","section":"post","summary":"Knowledge arround sudden death in early 20th century Egypt","tags":["death","heart disease","sudden death","disease"],"title":"Sudden Death","type":"post"},{"authors":["Grace Damato"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"In the 1906-10-30 issue of the Egyptian Gazette, I came across a telegram cable about “The Koepenick Robbery”. This telegram discussed how a man named Voigt appeared in court and the entire courtroom burst into laughter. This struck me as odd, so I looked for further instances where the Koepenick robbery or Mr. Voigt were mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette. Employing a simple word search through my content repository I found 7 examples where either Mr. Voigt or the robbery were mentioned. Using these newspaper entries and outside sources, I learned that, in 1906, a man named Wilhelm Voigt pretended to be a Prussian military officer and used his “position” to arrest the mayor of Koepenick and steal 4,000 marcs from their municipal treasury. The story caught the world by storm and despite his apparent violation of the law, media outlets portrayed him as the protagonist of the story. While many law enforcement officers contended Voigt was a terrible criminal who deserved to be imprisoned for his actions, the public admired his ability to outwit the government and military figures. This increasing admiration led to the German Emporer of the time, Wilhelm II, pardoning Voigt of his transgressions. While this is an entertaining and humorous story of civilian cunningness, it also reveals a greater truth about the influence of public perception and the power of the media in international affairs. Before his daring escapade, Voigt was a low-class shoemaker. Therefore, much of the European population related to Voigt’s humble beginnings, likely contributing to their later praise of his ability to deceive privileged, upper-class political powers. Specifically, Voigt undermined German authority. For this reason, I have included a link to Daniel Arenas’s Blog Post, Attitudes towards Germany: Random, Situational, or Seasonal?, in which Arenas seeks to uncover the impact of media propaganda through articles supportive and critical of Germany during World War II (the time in which the Koepenick robbery also took place).\nIt is also important to note that even though Voigt’s actions did not directly impact the people in Alexandria, he was still a notable and recurring entry in their local paper. The story’s presence in the Egyptian Gazette reveals its reader’s interests and attitudes toward international incidents. For this reason, I have attached a link to Jacob Stefonek’s post on Fleet Tracking, which also discusses how the Egyptian Gazzete covers multinational incidents, specifically concerning the location of Russian and Japanese fleets in 1905. Like Voigt’s case, this information was not relevant to Alexandrian residents but still appeared in their papers\nSources: This Day In History - October 17 1906 Journalistische Vermittlung und ihre Aneignung - Abstract Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus’s Criticism of Psycho-analysis and Psychiatry By Thomas Szasz, Karl Kraus · 1990 (Page 122) ","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"b97997dae384b52837f0e079e5a44ceb","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-22-damato/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-22-damato/","section":"post","summary":"Disguised as a military Officer, one man tricks the German military and government, steals 4,000 marcs, and the public loves it.","tags":["Robberies","International"],"title":"Koepernick Robbery","type":"post"},{"authors":["Fiona Dininger"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"While reading the Egyptian Gazette, I came across many mentions of seemingly trivial details about members of the upper class, including a mention of Crookshank Pasha’s travel dates. Intrigued by the interest the public had in the movements of their leaders, I began looking into how many times specific leaders were mentioned when I noticed a pattern: the importance of their wives. Despite having no significant job themselves, the wives of powerful men were mentioned continuously in the Gazette.\nAs in the case of the Crookshanks, Mrs. Crookshank was mentioned almost half as many times as her husband, despite not being the one influencing public policy. However, while she may not have held office, Mrs. Crookshank and many other wives like her held their own unique influence over the public in an emerging role: the celebrity. In the diary of diplomat Thomas Skelton Harrison, Mrs. Crookshank is repeatedly mentioned and described in personal detail, whereas her husband is only listed for his duties. This suggests that It is well known that women had great influence in the home during this period, but they also were able to influence society as a whole in the social sphere. As suggested by women becoming aware of their autonomy and worth, which can be seen in Sonali Pustam’s blog post, gender roles began to change in the 1900s. This pattern is reflected in the mentioning of wives of politicians as public figures in their own right. Mrs. Crookshank’s outfit at a wedding is even reported in the Gazette with no mention of her husband, a true sign of her individual status. As seen in another blog post by Sonali Pustam, women’s fashion was being reported more in the 1900s, a sign of the continuing influence that upper class wives had on the general public.\n","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"718ae529f094ab9129d6b90b466c9936","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-20-dininger/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-20-dininger/","section":"post","summary":"Wives of the important men of Egypt began to influence society in their own right.","tags":["Women's rights","news"],"title":"The Importance of  Wives: Women of Influence in the 1900s","type":"post"},{"authors":["McKenna Oakley"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"While encoding my 1906-10-17 issue of the Egyptian Gazette, I was enthralled by mention of the bubonic plague in the “Local and General” section. The bubonic plague is a bacterial infection commonly carried by fleas and rats that causes fever, swollen lymph nodes, and even gangrene in the extremities, hence its nickname the “Black death”. I was familiar with this plague’s epidemic in Western Europe during the 14th century, but I had not realized that the plague continued to infect humans. Upon further research, I learned that there was a second epidemic of the bubonic plague in India throughout the 19th and 20th centuries for about five decades. Cases of bubonic plague persist around the world still even to this day, which I found particularly intriguing; it completely dumbfounded my previous notions that the plague no longer existed. Specifically in the context of Egypt in the early 20th century, I learned from past student blog posts that the plague was most prevalent in 1904, followed by an immediate, drastic decrease in 1905. In fact, there was a bulletin posted in October of 1905 that read “NO MORE PLAGUE.” Within just two years, the total cases dropped to zero, which I found compelling considering the plague’s reputation of spreading viscously.\nMy issue’s report of the plague’s reappearance further complicates the issue of the bubonic plague in early 20th century Egypt; what allowed the plague to dwindle down and reappear? What specific conditions fostered an epidemic in India but not in Egypt when they were dealing with the same disease? These are questions that microhistorical data in the Egyptian Gazette can help answer. I also think it’s important to note that the afflicted person in this bulletin was a waiter, meaning he had ample opportunity to transmit the disease to countless other people. A later issue in the same month of that year revealed that there had been 500 cases from January to October in 1906, which is a stark increase from the supposedly zero cases in 1905; this all leads me to conclude that this case of plague was not rare for the time, and that the plague reappeared with a vigor. I wonder, too, if there was any significance to the newspaper mentioning that he was Greek; was this their way of racializing the disease? Upon looking futher into the Egyptian Gazette, I discovered a trend in reporting individual cases of the bubonic plague with little to no detail in the “Local and General” section. In issues like this one, the bulletins were only concerned with sharing the numbers of cases and the deaths. (In this issue, the “Bubonic Plague” bulletin is in the third column.) Rarely did they report the occupation or ethnicity of someone afflicted, which makes this particular bulletin all the more interesting and worthy of research.\n","date":1666224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666224000,"objectID":"fb66df92dfee7fca9b563c1291a51174","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-10-20-oakley/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-10-20-oakley/","section":"post","summary":"The *Egyptian Gazette* contains useful data for the spread of bubonic plague in Egypt in the early 20th century, which prompts further quesitons about the spread of the disease in recent times.","tags":["plague","bubonic plague"],"title":"Bubonic Plague's Continuation Into the 20th Century","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sara Casimiro"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"I wanted to explore the Personal and Social section of the newspaper since this section tends to have more interesting stories. While I did not find anything too riveting in my three editions, I did stumble upon the name Lord Londesborough. I am not sure why this name caught my eye, but I wanted to find out what was so interesting about him since he was mentioned in the newspaper so casually. In the photo you can see that it was just stated that he had just left the Savoy hotel. So, I figured he must be some kind of artist or author since that was enough to make the news.\nIn the first book listed on Google books, he is described as a wealthy man with a love for horses. He inherited his wealth from his family and used his house as a place to teach people how to drive horse carriages. He is described as a man of style and status in this reading.\nIn the next source, it discusses the legal aspects of an estate that Lord Londesborough was purchasing. In the sources I have found about him it rarely ever mentions his career, which is originally what I thought he was popular for. Turns out, he is just a wealthy man from a wealthy family. That is why he is so prominent in the Egyptian Gazette personal and social section.\nTo try to get more specific results, I searched his name and then “author”. I was really hoping to get more of an interesting story about this person and I thought that maybe he had written and published something. However, it seems that he was just popular for being from a wealthy family and inheriting that wealth. I am quite disappointed with this outcome; I was hoping to learn more about a famous author or artist, but he was just some boring rich man. In this last source he is mentioned in it simply because he owned the renaissance art that was discussed in the article.\nEven though I did not research a famous author or artist, it was still interesting to read about Lord Londesborough.

Lord Cromer, a prominent figure in Egypt’s economy, was originally pitched this idea by William Wedderburn while “serving in India as Finance Member of Lord Ripon’s government”. Lord Cromer was fond of the idea and pitched it to the Government of India, however, they rejected the idea. Lord Cromer then carried this idea to the Egyptian Government, where they finally established the “Agricultural Bank of Egypt in May of 1902”. The idea proved to be promising as it initially attracted a lot of investors as well as clients (Jakes).\nMy project aims to analyze the movement of the Agricultural Bank stocks on the different exchanges listed in the Egyptian Gazette. I mainly focus on the London Stock Exchange: “Agricultural Banks” and the Cairo Stock Exchange: “Agricultural Bank of Egypt”. To gather this data, I originally used the following Queries to locate my desired data:\n//div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-bduc01\u0026#34;]/table[1]/row[3]/cell[3]/measure //div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-lsex01\u0026#34;]/table[1]/row[3]/cell[3]/measure While these queries located some of my data, it was evident that along the line there was a template change in both stock exchanges which led to inaccurate data. In order to combat, this I updated the following queries:\n//div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-lsex01\u0026#34;]/table[1]/row/cell[contains(., \u0026#34;Agricultural Banks\u0026#34;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/measure //div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-bduc01\u0026#34;]/table[1]/row/cell[contains(., \u0026#34;Agricultural Bank of Egypt\u0026#34;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/measure This updated query gave me more accurate data, however, it was clear from the repeated values that a lot of the issues included the templated value and not the issue’s actual value. In order to combat this, I had to double check the microscanned pages and manually fill in some values.\nThe upward trends in the graph could be facilitated through a multitude of reasons. The first being the initial upward trend could be a result of the reaction of the public to the newly created agricultural banks. As explained by Aaron Jakes, “Its mortgages at 9% interest seemed to offer the bank’s clients an appealing alternative to existing forms of local moneylending” (Jakes). Additionally, the influx of foreign money coming into Egypt propelled a lot of land owners into participating in one of Egypt’s main agricultural exports at the time, cotton. Agricultural Banks established by Lord Cromer seemed to be an easy way into the agricultural industry.\nThe downward trends can be explained by the apparent problems with the Agricultural Bank’s structure as well as environmental problems during the early 1900s. While the foreign capital influenced landowners to enter the industry, the majority of the foreign money flowed directly into the pockets of wealthy landowners in the industry. Additionally, the foreign money also “drove down the profitability of loans against agricultural land and produce” (Jakes). The main driving force in the downward trends would be a result of the “cotton worm”. The cotton worm not only destroyed cotton seeds but also weakened the soil quality on which cotton was grown, decreasing yields. This caused people to stay out of the industry driving the Agricultural Bank’s stocks downwards.\nSource Jakes, Aaron. Egypt’s Occupation: Colonial Economism And The Crises Of Capitalism.

In a hypothetically rational society, this would be a great failure, and likely shut down very quickly as government officials would see this as a scam. However, in a time when the public is generally less skeptical of the media and more gullible towards misinformation, as a result of a lower standard of living and information not spreading around as easily as it does today, it would make sense that almost anyone could create a fake cure to multiple diseases and sell it as this sort of ‘miracle cure’ that you see with products advertised in the Egyptian Gazette, such as Peruna and Pink Pills for Pale People. Due to the lack of good medicine and understanding of how to treat severe diseases such as Cholera or kidney disease, snake oil cures became popular as what would be an alternative for people who were desperate at the time to cure deadly ailments and were especially even more appealing towards a society with a much lower standard of living and a very low standard of public health.\nDr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People contained miracle stories of patients making amazing recoveries from illnesses that would have them on the verge of death, but once they started taking these mysterious pills, the illness would go away. One problem with these stories is that they could have been made up, and there was no way for anyone to verify whether they were true or not. Another is that they all followed the same exact format of progression, starting with talking about how they were so ill that they were on death’s door, and none of the doctors had any idea what to do. Then, it would go to saying that they tried the pink pills, with a quote such as, “Then someone recommended me Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People, and all my troubles were cured.” The format for the stories that were apparently submitted by customers were essentially all the same and were all written in incredibly formal tones with similar styles, hinting at the fact that they were likely made up. Peruna’s advertising strategy was very similar to this as well. All of the advertisements were written in ways in the newspapers that would make them look more like a news story rather than an advertisement too, a clever marketing scheme that would make it less likely for the reader to quickly skim over the advertisement.\nThis graph basically shows the total amount of mentions of each medicine per year throughout the Egyptian Gazette. It gives the viewer a general idea of how the popularity of the medicines increased over these three years, but it doesn’t take into account whether some advertisements may have mentioned ‘Pink Pills’ for example maybe only twice, or maybe 10 times.\nThis graph here shows the total amount of articles each year that mention either Peruna or Pink Pills. You can see that there is a significant increase in the popularity in both over the course of 1905 through 1907. This graph gives a pretty accurate idea of how many more advertisements there were for both ‘Peruna’ and ‘Pink Pills’ over the years, but one other factor to consider is the ratio of advertisements for both companies to the total number of issues of the Gazette per year.\nThis last graph does that, in that it shows the percentage of how many mentions of both ‘Peruna’ and ‘Pink Pills’ there were to the total number of issues of the Egyptian Gazette each year. Even when this percentage is considered, it can still be seen that there is still a significant increase in the frequency of these kinds of advertisements each year. It can be concluded that the popularity of the advertisements for ‘Pink Pills’ and ‘Peruna’ likely increased in Egypt between 1905 to 1907.\nAnother major question that is faced with this data is why are people gullible to these alternative medicines? It is obvious that one of the reasons is due to the lack of medical knowledge and transparency a century ago, but there is a bigger part of the explanation that many leave out. “Studies show that satisfaction with mainstream media is not an important factor in deciding to use CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine), that CAM users are generally satisfied with their mainstream care, and they use CAM because it aligns with their philosophy, and they simply want to expand their options.” (Steven Novella 2012, Why Do People turn to Alternative Medicine) It can be concluded from this that people today and in the past have also fallen for these scams due to wanting to have many different options and that they simply have the idea in mind of trying anything to cure the illness that they have. It seems that it is desperation that clouds people’s judgement to go towards snake oil cures, such as Peruna or Pink Pills, which would have been especially prevalent in early 20th century Egypt, due to the prevalence of diseases such as …","date":1639440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639440000,"objectID":"92b32bcf32f9ba9c8a2ece412bd2f6be","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-yanevich/","publishdate":"2021-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-analysis-yanevich/","section":"post","summary":"What happens when individuals, without any credentials, can make bold claims about a product and convince the public that they have the ‘miracle cure’ that can cure any disease?

The tobacco industry thrived in Egypt alongside the “development of industrialized agriculture cash crops,” and Egypt was known for exporting luxury cigarettes around the world. Beginning in 1860, the Ottoman Empire’s state monopoly on tobacco only awarded Greek and Ottoman tobaccomen the right to cultivate tobacco (Shechter). This led to the expansion of the cigarette industry with the arrival of more tobaccomen from Greece and the Ottoman Empire, with the emergence of large-scale cigarette factories from previously smaller made-to-order tobacco stores. Eventually, in 1903, the Egyptian government adds a separate cigarette section to the annual foreign commerce reports (Shechter).\nResearch The initial research question I set out to analyze examined the cigarette and tobacco exports from Alexandria to Constantinople listed under the “Export Manifests.” From using the following queries:\n//div[@feature=\u0026#39;exportManifests\u0026#39;]//p[contains(., \u0026#39;CONST\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p[1] //div[@feature=\u0026#39;exportManifests\u0026#39;]//p[contains(., \u0026#39;CONST\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p[2] //div[@feature=\u0026#39;exportManifests\u0026#39;]//p[contains(., \u0026#39;CONST\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p[3] I was able to find several data points under the Export Manifests feature containing the letters “Const” (for Constantinople), and that were in the paragraphs immediately, two, and three after the word “Const.” From the table below, it is evident that there were not enough available data points to draw conclusions or analyze the data available for larger patterns or trends.\nDate Amt of Tobacco Destination Co. 01-29-1906 20 Syria \u0026amp; Const 3-28-1906 56 Piraeus \u0026amp; Const 3-28-1906 100 Const 12-31-1906 120 Syria \u0026amp; Const Cie Nav Helienique 06-20-1907 30 Port Said \u0026amp; Const 09-25-1907 26 Const 11-20-1907 20 Const Date Amt of Cigarettes Destination Co.

While the Austro-Hungarian Empire wasn’t significantly involved in the Scramble for Africa or other colonial endeavors, the aging empire did still actively exert influence outside of Europe. Egypt was one of those nations where their presence was felt at the turn of the twentieth century, and this can be attributed to multiple factors. The first major reason for this influence was that in important Egyptian cities like Alexandria, Austro-Hungarians made up the fifth largest European community by 1905.1 As well, Austro-Hungarian currency was heavily present and widely used in Egypt and the Middle East as they produced the Maria Theresa Dollar which was a global currency as it traveled from Austria through the Ottoman Empire where it became engrained in African and Middle Eastern societies.2 The final reason for Austria-Hungary’s influence in Egypt was its exports and imports with the nation. In this analysis I will only be analyzing the significance of these trade relations, and through Austria-Hungary’s trade of furniture goods to Egypt and its trade of fresh fish from Egypt it’s evident that Austria-Hungary did have a significant presence in Egyptian society.\nTo inaugurate, the major import that Austria-Hungary and Austro-Hungarian businesses contributed to Egypt was furniture such as bentwood which was fashioned into chairs and other furnishings. Bentwood was important during the 1900s because cities like Alexandria were growing every year due to Europeans moving there or touring for extended periods of time.3 To support the creation of new houses for these newcomers, furniture was essential, and bentwood chairs were one of those items constantly in demand as Egypt grew. Austria-Hungary was the nation best suited to take advantage of this market for furniture because of its low freight rates and the labor to make furniture in Austria-Hungary cost less to produce bentwood products than any other European nation like Britain could.4 The exact comparison in how much lower Austro-Hungarian prices were was that “packing, freight, insurance, and duty from Austria 25 per cent of an invoice, whilst from London these charges amount to… 35 per cent”.5 The result was that Austria-Hungary imported nearly 43% of all furniture to Egypt from 1900-1904. This threatened nations like Britain who wanted to expand their control of the furniture trade to Egypt so they began advertising English furniture more heavily which is evident in “The Egyptian Gazette” through articles advertising “High Class English Furniture” catalogues for the public to view and browse.6 This was done because English merchants knew they couldn’t compete with Austria-Hungary’s lower prices so they tried making theirs seem of a higher quality and class.\n7\nMoreover, Austria-Hungary also exerted influence in Egypt through its exports from the nation because it contributed to Egyptian businesses, and one of the most significant and interesting export was that of fresh fish. I discovered there was a significant trade of barrels of fresh fish from Egypt to Austria-Hungary because I had noticed Klink and Lauer was a company that consistently exported barrels of fresh fish to Brindisi and Trieste, and through a report on the Fishing and Aquaculture Exhibition at the Milan Exposition of 1906, I discovered the company made products like sardine oil and operated out of Trieste which was a major Austro-Hungarian port.8 Knowing that I hoped to compare its export of fresh fish to that of the rest of the world to ascertain its influence over this trade of fresh fish, but I was very surprised to learn there were only two companies from October 1905 to January 1908 which regularly exported fresh fish from Egypt.9 This other company was under the name A. Frick, and interestingly he exported fresh fish to Brindisi and Trieste from 1905- February 1907 while Klink and Lauer started in February 1907 and went until 1908 exporting primarily on the exact same route. While I couldn’t find scholarly articles expressing why there was a demand for fresh fish in Brindisi or Trieste outside of the nature of Klink and Lauer creating sardine oil, I do hypothesize that A. Frick is associated with Klink and Lauer due to the same routes and how smooth the transition for exports was with only one overlap in February 1907. This monopoly of fresh fish regularly going to one place over the course of nearly two and a half years displays that there was a demand and market for the product, but due to limited mentions of fresh fish in “The Egyptian Gazette” in articles and limited outside resources mentioning that trade I’m unable to dig further.\nTo reiterate, Austria-Hungary is clearly shown to have had significance and a role in Egyptian society because of how active it was in the importing of furniture and exporting of …","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"12503c2df887b13d76cae45519668fd0","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-roy/","publishdate":"2021-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-analysis-roy/","section":"post","summary":"The nineteenth century was clearly defined as an age of empires as great European powers colonized the globe and extended their vast influence through trade or other means.

Hard times were faced as Egypt was coming up on multiple crises. The hard times would seemingly create a change in how many people are visiting Egypt. In the early 20th century Egypt was struggling against cotton worms, disease, financial collapse, over-farming, and political instability. Given the high number of issues arising in Egypt a shift in the number of tourists and visitors on business would be expected. In addition a change in the ratio between the two groups of visitors would also be expected. After looking deeper, the data points to no obvious trend, up or down.\nIn “Boom, Bugs, Bust: Egypt’s Ecology of Interest, 1882–1914,” Aron Jakes explores the intersection of the numerous crises in Egypt. Along with this Jakes also elaborates on how all the crises came together, amplifying each other. The dire situation faced in Egypt had many effects on everyday life in Egypt. For example Jakes discusses the employment of forced child labor. The server condition in Egypt would seemingly lower the number of visitors.\nIn order to gather data for a visualization of the number of visitors in Alexandria I used both the Visitors List and the Nile Tourists features. The two XPath queries I used are //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains( . , \u0026#39;VISITORS LIST\u0026#39;)] and //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains( . , \u0026#39;VISITORS LIST\u0026#39;)]. I copied the years with the start location and end location. I used the formula =C1-B1 to give me the number of lines taken up by the section. The difference of the start and end location gives me an estimate of how many people were visiting Alexandria in comparison to other days. The numerical value of the difference has no other significance outside of the comparison.\nTo visualize my findings I used multiple graphs. The first and second show the relation of Visitors List length to the date.\nThe third shows the relation between the date and length of the Nile Tourists feature.\nAll three of the graphs show no correlation between the progression towards the financial crisis and the number of visitors in Alexandria. The data range is wide in all four years examined. The graphs oscillate continuously. In addition to the lack of trend, the data also has major time gaps, making it impossible to estimate which years had the longest visitors list or Nile Tourists feature. After reviewing my results, it has become evident the rise of crises in Egypt did not affect tourism. From 1905 to 1908 there was neither an up or down trend in the number of visitors in Alexandria. It is possible in the years closer to 1914 there is a more visible change in tourism.\n","date":1639008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008000,"objectID":"3a51ec0684322dbb3090a2baf492c2ee","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-walton/","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-analysis-walton/","section":"post","summary":"In the years leading up to financial collapse in early 20th century Egypt, a change in the number of visitors would be expected.

The Cairo police has brutally treated poorly the dogs. Dogs back in 1905 were not commonly thought of as dearly as people do now in days. However, since 1905, Alexandria experienced a volume of dogs having rabies. The Cairo police, have without previous motive or permission, sent down there to kill the dogs and poisoned any dog that is on the station or the streets irrespective of ownership or whether the dogs were “pariah.” The action has caused some dissatisfaction prevention to animal in Cairo when it was happening. In addition, due to the large numbers of dogs are being poised and shot by the Cairo police in the city. The Regulations on Dogs, and have issued an order to the office that all dogs in the streets must either be muzzled or led. The muzzle must be of one of the descriptions which are to be seen at the Municipality’s central sanitary office. Owners of dogs are given one moths like, until the 27th November, to conform to this regulation. Infringements after that date will be severely punished. However, the police in Cairo was killing the dogs because the rabies were infecting humans. A total of 16 deaths claims of rabies, 7 at Cairo and 4 at Alexandria. Influenza terminated fatally in 85 cases, of which 18 were at Cairo and 6 at Alexandria. There were 19 deaths from leprosy. Medinet el-Fayoum had no less than 4 fatal cases out of the total, the balance being spread in even proportions all over Egypt. Puerperal fever terminated fatally in 215 cases, of which 75 were at Cairo and 44 at Alexandria. There were 136 deaths from whooping cough, 31 at Suez, 16 at Cairo, and 3 at Alexandria. Small- pox was responsible for 1,093 and measles for 5, 260 deaths.

While there are other blog posts about different animals and dogs, I saw few records of dogs getting killed for having rabies. I ran multiple XPath’s to be able to have a little chart explaining how many dogs the Cairo police killed from 1905 all the way to 1907. In each issue the Egyptian Gazette that was analyzed from my week there was one about “The Cairo Police” which for me was very interesting it was a subsection that fell below the general as well as the local portion of the paper. I started to work with the Cairo police article but honestly nothing seem interesting for me until I started reading about how the police was killing ownerless dog. This lead to the question Why are dogs getting killed by the Cairo police? To search through the digital Egyptian gazette at first was really hard to really look what was the actual idea of why the dogs were getting killed . In particular, I started using //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;dog\u0026#39;)] which brought me to the general and local section but for me that was not enough there is where I started reading that back In the early 19th century Egypt was filled with cases of dogs having rabies leading to the police killing them. Later on I started to look at rabies, Cairo dogs, police, registration of dogs, and rabid. Doing a search of //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;dog rabies\u0026#39;)]. This gave me an estimate of how many dogs the police of Cairo were killing since 1905 all the way to 1907. While doing this analysis project and doing research in the digital Egyptian Gazette I end up to the conclusion that stray dogs were never really under control as much as many dogs were killed and poison more continue to come. After that a regulation came that all dogs needed to be register with a collar that had a “metallic plaque” with a registration number. If the dogs were found without a registration number they were keep the dog for 5 days and then the police will poison them or killed them. For me this analysis project was challenging at first but realizing all the information that I learned from this was great.

In this issue of the newspaper, on the third page, there was an article referring to a recent seize of £5,000 worth Hashish from Mr. H.C. Parkinson’s home. The article was published in the newspaper next to the Government Measures column.\nThe article explained that Mr. Parkinson, the owner of the home, kept hearing strange noises in his house, and when he went to look around he was surprised to see a light on in his kitchen. He brushed it off and went back to sleep, but awoke to more noises. Arming himself with a loaded revolver, he went outside and stumbled over a large sack and soon realized that hashish was being landed. Mr. Parkinson rang the Coast Guard and when they arrived they found eighteen sacks of hashish around the enclosure. The selling price of this amount of hashish costs L.E. 5,000.\nMr. Parkinson’s suffragee was to blame for the amount of hashish and was taken into custody. It was found that the hashish brought over was from Greece, and ten smugglers were burying it up from Mr. Parkinson’s yard when it all belonged to the suffragee. Was it a random act or were the smugglers trying to get Mr. Parkinson in trouble? Was the suffragee trying to get Mr. Parkinson in trouble?

Particularly, this was an advertisement for Khedivial Mail Lines for their steamship Ismalia, which was taking Egyptians to the Athens Olympic Games from Alexandria. The rates seem far cheaper than I expected, as today going to the Olympics is very expensive, due to the extensive travel worldwide. This level of travel is what has the potential to impact the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo by delay or even possible cancelation, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Compared to this advertisement, what I found most interesting was the passengers sleeping in the ship, as we have recently heard of several outbreaks on cruise ships, which would be the modern equivalent. Effectively, I wonder if concerns with such an epidemic would have been greater or lesser, as there was less travel and news took longer to travel than a quick Google search, or if it would have been greater due to a lack of modern medical practices.

England was the first country to make this system of classifying and using fingerprints official in its police forces. With Alexandria being occupied by England in the early 1900’s, this new technology quickly spread to Egypt.\nHowever, fingerprinting was not the foolproof method of crime fighting we know it to be today. In 1905, people in Alexandria were excited about this new technology, but could not trust it fully. The underdeveloped technique often provided incorrect results which caused people to be fearful of wrongful convictions.\nEven today, there are problems with faulty fingerprint evidence resulting in wrongful convictions and the technology has been improved upon for over one hundred years. There is also a theory that part of the reason fingerprinting became so popular in England and British occupied countries was that it helped the British keep track of those under their control without any cultural barriers.\nFingerprinting is a universal way to identify people that does not require those people to speak the same language and therefore is less likely to be deceptive. This article from the Egyptian Gazette warns the public of the mistakes that can be made when the police are not trained well enough to interpret fingerprint evidence; however, it still supports the use of the technology when done correctly. The view of this article seems to support the British view on the emerging technology of fingerprint evidence.\n","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"5b3107501a192007575f4892569c4b55","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2020-03-10-carolinebanks/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-10-carolinebanks/","section":"post","summary":"In 1905, matching fingerprints to identify criminals was a new technology.

The opening line:\n“So much has been said and written about the incompetency of our Cairo police in the local papers, that it is quite a pleasure to be able to report a really smart capture recently effected by the greatly maligned arm of the law”\nThe story telling in this piece is fantastic and by the end of the story, the person who reported the stolen bank notes refused to compensate the police 10%, so the police decided to hold the money indefinitely. This story appeared in the Local and General section in the July 25th, 1907 edition of the newspaper.\nFrom this story, major conclusions can be drawn about the state of law enforcement in Egypt at the time. The efficiency of the Egyptian Police was greatly hindered by the Capitulations imposed on the Ottoman Empire by European powers. These Capitulations exempted foreigners from local laws and thus, the local authorities had to tread carefully around making arrest and upholding the law. This could be the “maligned arm of the law” referenced earlier.\nThere are many instances of the Egyptian police displaying inability to act from anarchist or obnoxious beggars. With the Capitulations being a tool of European imperialism in Egypt, many European foreigners would commit crimes and get away with it due to the layers and layers of paperwork needed to make an arrest. Under the Capitulation System, European life and well being was the primary concerns of the state. This led to drastic inequalities in the justice system. This story is one of many that can be traced back to the societal inequalities posed by European imperialism.\n","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"333f5b6c56833553058f38ba08314c9f","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2020-03-10-kennethhills/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-10-kennethhills/","section":"post","summary":"The Cairo Police pulled of a near impossible feat by finding the lost money of an innkeeper with very little details.","tags":["Police","Cairo"],"title":"The Cairo Police","type":"post"},{"authors":["Robert Klein"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"On Wednesday, September 4th, 1907, located on the third page under the column the Financial Advisor, the article explains how pedestrians are frustrated after the death of a native notable.

People also hoped that drivers would be held responsible if future accidents, such as the one this section mentions, occurred.

After the war with Britain, Egypt was turned into a colony of Britain. Its economy had significant growth from the business introduced by the British. Businessman and the Egyptian colonial government promoted the transfer of western industry to the locals. They strived to make the region like a European state. 1 To achieve that, many local resources such as arable lands and mineral pits were used for growing crops and mining. As more local industries started trading with other parts of the world, the stock and exchange market formed.\nThe History of Daira Senieh The newspaper Egyptian Gazette was the primary source for this analysis project. A company named Daira Senieh caught my attention. The classification of Daira Senieh was ambiguous. During the group project, some of my research partners found that the company was associated with land. However, Daira Senieh was also a sugar company that owned several agricultural plants and sugar cane fields. The company was known for its sugar plantation in Upper Egypt and its massive freight transportation. Samir Raafat, a former banker, a columnist, wrote in his article that Daira Senieh owned 470 km of railroad lines, 65 locomotives, and 2,092 wagons. 2 Even in the present day, the company’s scale is sizable. Additionally, the company originated from lands of the Egyptian royal family. There was a time when the company had a financial crisis. Egypt had a loss of its political sovereignty around the 1870s as the foreign rivalry entered. However, one study suspected that Egypt had sufficient resources and potential economic growth. Still, the reformed British government had mismanaged Egypt’s financial revenue, so the depression of the Egyptian companies started forming. 3 Companies like Daira Senieh had to either borrow loans or sell the company’s assets, such as lands. In addition, the bad harvest and Russo-Turkish War aggravated Egypt’s financial situation.\nThe Occurrence of Daira Senieh To understand the significance of the company in this analysis, I queried the data set of the newest DEG .xml archives (right before first-time publishing this article.) I thought the occurrence of Daira Senieh might leave hints on its economic activities in different periods. I, therefore, sorted out the data via the XPath 2.0 search with the code, count(//div/head[matches(.,\u0026#39;Daira\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p), and got the result which revealed in the following treemap (cubics) and bar graph.\nGoing further in-depth with the date featured with Daira Senieh, I found more content that is relevant to the companies’ shares and properties. Other than the company name found in Stock and Exchange, Page 3 articles often wrote about company meetings involved with legal, liabilities, assets of the company. Along these lines, the occurrence helped to link the history and changes of Daira Senieh. It additionally enriched the explanations of the events of the company.\nPrivatization of Land As I mentioned earlier, the company had relationships with the Egyptian royal family. At surface level, its land could be the company’s private property, but, in reality, it also could be seen as the state’s territory/land. It attempted to bail out the company through auctions. As we know, the company had Royal family ties, so the auction set by Daira Senieh was controversial because the properties of the company could also be deemed as the nation’s properties. Indeed, auctions on lands ended with a failure. In one report published by The Brisbane Courier 4, an Australia newspaper, the sale of Daira Senieh had disapproval from the English and the French syndicate groups. The Egyptian government demanded to have one-third of a share from the final sale price which hindered the auction process. Subsequent to the auction held in the last ten years, the company “was unable to let a single acre of the sugar lands for 1888 in eight out of nine districts, and only 95 acres in the ninth district (the number offered to be let being about 25,000).” 5 In the 1900 Annual Report by Consul-General Cromer on the Finances, Administration, and Condition of Egypt, an excerpt stated, “the Government and the Company share equally in the net profit derived from the sale of land… meanwhile … the company now offers to sell lands on payment of one-tenth of the price, before 1905, after which time the buyers will have the option of paying the balance in cash or in fifteen annuities.” It seemed that the government and Daria Seineh were encouraging peasants to be the owner of the debts, but it also sold out the land to foreign proprietors. 6\nDaira Senieh Loan As the Daira Senieh continued to privatize its agricultural properties, the value of the lands, which was diluted on the open market, increased tremendously 1. Therefore, the company’s consortium gained revenue, which exceeded their outstanding debts, so it paid off its …","date":1576540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576540800,"objectID":"51f52096da7d6e4d3ad709071490d90d","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-chen/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-chen/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction This individual research extends the group project on the topic of economics and trade in Egypt.

The sickness only worsens as she finds out her husband had died falling, trying to get out of a tram car in America. The story goes on with how she healed to the point of full health after discovering the existence of the pills.\nTo me, this article seems to be more about promoting an idea than a real cure. What offsets its validity as a medicine is the idea that it could cure numerous types of sicknesses. “They cure anaemia, chlorosis, general debility, stom-ach complaints, rheumatism and neurasthenia.” Targeting the population, it uses several tactics. The article appeals to the entire audience, saying “Everyone must agree” and “they will do for everybody” and more. The article uses a relatable and pained main character that the people would feel sorry for, appealing to human emotions when the descriptions of her life and tragedies such as her husband dying.\n“From this instance one learns what Pink Pills can achieve for the weak and enfeebled.” This statement paints the pill as a wondrous cure that saves people from weakness.\nWhat I found was that these stories of the use of phenomenal Pink Pills may be continuous and confirm their worth.

The Ottoman governor Mehmed ‘Ali Pasha instituted corvée, in which peasant workers were conscripted into the cotton fields and other government projects such as building the Suez Canal. Throughout his reign, ‘Ali held tight control over Egypt’s economy and trade. The profits of exports were used to fund ‘Ali’s many military campaigns. However, Ali’s successors wanted to open Egypt up to European investors. By the time of Khedive Isma’il, Egypt was borrowing heavily from French and British banks on the supposition that cotton harvests would pay them back. In the 1860s, the vacuum left by the American Civil War did cause cotton prices to rise and Egypt’s cotton market to prosper. However, the influx of cotton after the Civil War caused a series of events that culminated in Egypt going bankrupt in 1876. As the economy spiraled, Egyptian citizens grew restless. General Ahmad ‘Urabi Pasha spearheaded a revolt with the support of Egypt’s citizens. In 1882, Britain took control of Egypt and ended the revolt in order to protect her investment, all under the guise of promoting “honesty, humanity and justice.”\nUnder consul-general Lord Evelyn Baring Cromer, cotton yields in Egypt increased rapidly through the end of the 19th century, aided by restructuring of irrigation, taxes, and land-ownership. This productivity encouraged investors from various countries to participate in a web of over-speculation that eventually burst in March of 1907. The following economic crisis was fueled by declining cotton yields, caused by the cotton worm, weakened seeds, and worsening soil quality. Irrigation policies developed by British engineers had actually flooded and brined the soil. The failures of certain British policies revitalized nationalist movements against outside interference and may have led to Cromer’s resignation in 1907. However, Egypt did not gain independence until after the events of World War I.\nChoosing a Data Source During the informal British occupation of Egypt, cotton exports were used to determine the state of the economy and whether new policies should be kept. Therefore, I decided to examine the table cotn01 from The Egyptian Gazette. This table details cotton exports to various countries and total monthly exports in balles (French for bales). As determined in the post Cotton Trade written by Nino Fricano, a bale of cotton at this time was approximately 20% smaller than the standard modern bale.\nI ran the following XPath query to obtain the total monthly cotton export value from every cotn01 table currently within The Digital Egyptian Gazette’s content repository:\n//div[@xml:id=“deg-el-cotn01”]/table//cell[contains(.,‘balles’)]/following-sibling::cell\nIsolating only the dates and values in Atom and importing them into Tableau, I was able to create the following line graph of cotton export trends from 1905 to 1907.\nLine graph showing original, unedited cotton export values by month Looking at the uncorrected data, the value 53,232 is quite prevalent. This identical value given for months in succession creates the horizontal portions of the graph above. Such an aberration within the raw data makes sense, as 53,232 is the number inputted within the original template. Any edition of The Egyptian Gazette in which the cotn01 table was simply copied and not corrected would retain that value. It is clear that the raw data does not provide an accurate enough perspective.\nCorrecting the Tables Fortunately, since the cotn01 table is a monthly recitation of exports, it should logically only change every four weeks. In order to narrow my search results, I decided to select the first date and cotn01 table from every month. Therefore, the pool of data to be proofed ended up only being 27 separate tables. Of these 27 tables, 10 of them contained the stock value while 2 others contained the same value as the previous month. Thankfully, this much more manageable number would still result in a complete data set.\nComplications The first complication that I encountered while correcting my sample of tables was unexpected. As it turns out, various encoders have made the same mistake of dropping in the cotn01 table when the actual microfilm used another table, ctns01. The ctns01 table shows stock prices for cotton shares rather than export values. In certain months, I was unable to find any cotn01 tables. I am unsure why this is, since this table should appear at least once per month.\nWhile checking the 2 repeated tables, I found that the table printed on January 2, 1906 is exactly the same as the one printed in December of 1905. This shows that the table does not change at the beginning of a new month, but rather somewhere in the middle. In January 1906, this change happened on the 11th. However, as the cotn01 table does not appear every single day, it is difficult to ascertain if there is a set day …","date":1576281600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576281600,"objectID":"bc39eae65dd4dadc1c8197aa28ad00f5","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-ku/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-ku/","section":"post","summary":"My objective was to devise a way to correct the monthly cotton export table within the Egyptian Gazette editions that have been converted to xml thus far, as well as attempting to link that data to existing primary and secondary sources.","tags":["trade","exports","cotton","tables"],"title":"Egypt’s Cotton Exports in the Early 1900s","type":"post"},{"authors":["Macray Simmers"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Temperature and Cotton production are tied together at a fundamental level. This is because temperature is a key component of agriculture, due to plants growing better in different climates. However, when looking at Egypt, their climatic tendencies have to be taken care of. These include temperatures ranging from “115 degrees F.” to “40 degrees F.” example. Cotton needs specific temperatures to grow well, those being around 70 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Seedlings can be stunted by heat, thus causing smaller cotton bulbs. Smaller bulbs mean less total cotton being produced. Because of this, temperature has a huge effect on cotton exports and, therefore, temperature has a huge effect on global economy. Because the Egyptian Gazette was produced during the shift from industrial times to a more information-based era, textile production was a huge factor in the global economy. It was also one of Egypt’s more important exports, again showing the importance of temperature in terms of the Egyptian cotton market and the global cotton market. Changes in the global cotton market directly affected the people of Egypt since it was their primary export, meaning most of their money comes from it. Thereby, lots of crop means lots of money for the country. Lots of money for the country eventually gets to the people, meaning more money for the people and a better standard of living, resulting in higher GDP and better livelihoods. Because of this, temperature should be vastly important to the wellbeing of Egypt due to its relation to cotton production.\nMax. Temp This graph demonstrates the highest average temperatures for the months January through December, 1905-1097 in Alexandria. Egypt has a “mild winter from November to April and hot summer from May to October example. This is clearly seen in the graph with lower temperatures being reported in the winter months while higher temperatures are recorded in the summer months. As seen, the average maximum temperatures reach, at their lowest, just below 20 degrees Celsius while, at their highest, they are just above 30 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature was recorded in July while the lowest temperature was found in February.\nMin. Temp This graph demonstrates the highest average temperatures for the months January through December, 1905-1097 in Alexandria. Egypt has a “mild winter from November to April and hot summer from May to October exampleh. This is clearly seen in the graph with lower temperatures being reported in the winter months while higher temperatures are recorded in the summer months. The lowest temperature was recorded in January, just like with the highest average temperatures, while the highest minimum temperatures were recorded in July and September. The lowest minimum temperature was between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius while the highest minimum temperatures were somewhere between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius.\nCotton This chart shows the average number of bales of cotton produced from January to December in Alexandria from 1905 to 1907. The peaks of bales produced were in January, May, and August, while the lowest dips are in March and September. January has an inordinately huge peak at around one million bales produced while the next highest month only has around six-hundred-thousand bales produced. Either this is correct or data from the Egyptian Gazette has been incorrectly computed or entered, resulting in this large peak.\nThe correlation between cotton production and temperature is somewhat hard to understand in individual graphs. It takes around six months for a cotton crop to reach maturity and be reaped. Because of this, one has to look six months back to see what months affected that particular crop of cotton. Because of this, I will be looking at the peaks in the cotton crop and see how they correspond to the average max and min temperature. For January, that means the temperatures from the month of July had the most impact on cotton growth. These temperatures ranged from just above 30 degrees Celsius to around 20 degrees Celsius, meaning the cotton grows best in higher temperatures. The lowest recorded number of bales produced happened to be in March, so the corresponding month is September, which has similar temperatures to July. Therefore, it could be deduced that temperature has little affect on the production of cotton. Instead, some other environmental factor(s) has a great affect on cotton production. However, when compared to current average temperatures, changes in climate can be found, thereby supporting or denying climate change and its inherent effects on the Earth.\n","date":1576195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576195200,"objectID":"811f2841262903037dea019ab107143e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-simmers/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-simmers/","section":"post","summary":"Temperature and Cotton production are tied together at a fundamental level.

This search gave back 349 items, which were just the share prices, which ranged from 2 5/8 to 3/8. According to David McMahon, who analyzed an Egyptian geological map, the gold was extracted mainly from the Wadi Hammamat region. This is a dry river bed around the Nile river, and was a major trading and mining route. The Nile Valley Gold mine was part of this trading route, and it was on the most direct path to the Red sea. This means that a lot of traffic went by these mines and trading posts.\nThe data was extracted using regular expressions in the Atom text editor, and then put into an excel spreadsheet. In Tableau, I added a filter to exclude outlier values that were not accurate. I the proceeded to exclude the values that were in the templates (1.125, 1.25, 1). This made the visualization seem like a more accurate picture of what the actual data reflects. In almost all issues, The Nile Valley Gold company has (New) next to it. This is because gold mining on a big scale was just beginning in Egypt. \u0026#34;Gold mining in the recent past has been on and off until 2009 when the Egyptian government gave out licenses to international partners to do the exploration in the eastern districts. For example, mining was done between 1902 and 1927 when it stopped until 1935 when it started again and then stopped in 1958.\u0026#34; This can explain the data I gathered.\nI wanted to see what the Egyptian Gazette said about the gold market, so I ran a basic search of the repository for mentions of gold in a paragraph. I found an interesting article talking about the demand of gold domestically and abroad. In the third of January of 1905, it says: \u0026#34;all countries which have debts held in large amounts abroad, the natives begin to buy back those debts as soon as they advance in prosperity. Egypt, apparently, is doing this now. In the second place, it relieves the London market from one drain for gold. True, gold shipments after the turn of the year will not cause as much inconvenience as they would have caused during the past two or three months. Still it is well that the demand for the metal from abroad should decline.\u0026#34;\nFrom this, we can deduce that a lot of gold is being shipped abroad. This is because of debts owed to other countries. However, the extent to which the demand for gold decreased is unknown. A conclusion cannot be drawn from the price of the gold stocks, as there are many factors that play into the price.\nThe visualized data, interestingly, shows a downward trend, as the value of gold goes from 2.625 in January of 1905 to .25 in August of the same year. The price doesn\u0026#39;t seem to recover. This could be due to many things. However, I believe that people were optimistic about the company at first, but then the company did not do well. New companies tend to carry a lot of risk, and have the possibility of failing. I wanted to know if the company did end up failing, and found a certificate of a share of the company at an auction. This certificate indicates that the share was selling for £1, indicating that the price did end up stabilizing somewhat. However, I can find no mention of the company beyond 1912. This suggests that either the other mining companies were more prominent and important, or that the company did not succeed as other companies were already mining the area.\nThere is no doubt that there is European presence in Egypt in the early Twentieth century. This is seen in advertisements, articles, and even the stocks and shares list. The Nile Valley Gold mine was run, presumably, by the British. It is, after all, valuated in Euros. A lot of mines were opened in the wake of the 1900s. \u0026#34;Their openings date from the early twentieth century at a time when the Eastern Desert experienced renewed interest and when British mining companies explored the ancient sites.\u0026#34; During this time there was also a growing interest on Ancient Egyptian history, and historians found various tombs decorated with gold. This, along with the large deposits of gold along the Nile river, led to great innovations in the gold mining sector.\nIn conclusion, the Nile Valley Gold company is but one company and does not give a clear indication of the gold market in Egypt. However, it does give insight on the popular trading spots, and how large scale gold mining became popular in Egypt around this time.\n","date":1576195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576195200,"objectID":"727351f82aeeab46744f1e0c724beac7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-mendez/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-mendez/","section":"post","summary":"I ran the XPath query: //div[@xml:id=\"deg-el-reut01\"]/table//cell[contains(.,'Nile Valley Gold Mine')]/following-sibling::cell/measure.

It included my interest in sports that I shared with the rest of my group. As for the reason why I specifically chose this, it was because I reasoned that horse back racing must have been quite popular during those times which would make for an equally enjoyable and manageable form of study. While looking through the text, it is evident that they do not officially play sports like we do here in the U.S. today. For instance, they do not take many things into consideration, such as variable handicaps as well as the weights of the actual people riding the horse. This is rather quite important considering a horse is not a car. Why these matter is because even in professional race car drivers, just being a leaner individual allows your car to effectively lose drag. This is somewhat negligible in say a street race but is practically essential in races that use very accurate and miniscule readings such as milliseconds.\nTo relate this back to the topic at hand, the race time tracking that take place in Egypt at that time are vastly inferior. This leads me to believe that they either have an understandable technological disadvantage or that they treat this as a mostly recreational/ semi professional event. I could possibly conclude, however, that it is a recreational event simply when looking at the time intervals between each race. The races all take place within roughly 30 minutes of each other. This does not allow any time for proper cleaning, shoveling of road, or any other professional changes done to ensure that it stays consistent through each race. Curiously enough, the audience also does not seem to value variety. This is seen when looking at how formulaic the text in the newspaper is. It follows the same pattern each race and even includes the same words about how, “Arab ponies have never won a race of any value.” This stagnation is even seen in the types of horses they use. Consistently as they put it, the Arab horses do not win, by quite a significant margin. In fact, most times it is the Galloway horses that triumph as they are the pure-bred ones. With these in mind, it does not seem as though they are trying to attract newer audiences or even change anything as the formula persists throughout months and years. Instead, it seems to have a following that much like its formula seems to remain largely unchanged as time goes by. Which leads me to the first weakness of this topic. As with anything that pertains to history, there is an innate issue with accuracy here. It is hard to determine whether this formula was made on purpose and is made that way for ease of reading throughout the multiple issues that this takes place, or if instead the writers simply did not want to creatively document it differently from issue to issue. Regardless of the reason, this makes it hard for a student to gather up his data simply due to the unusualness in how this data is presented. Likewise, prize pools can be systematically repeated throughout races as well. This adds another formulaic variable that makes this sport seem rather dull on the surface. In this sense, if a student were to look at this only through what is written on the newspaper, the sport would not look interesting enough to warrant even a second reading from a different issue and would beg the question why someone would not just guess their own results. Especially when there is quite frankly an 100% certainty that indeed the Arab pony will not win the day. With this being said, there are still some differences between the races. Such as the names of the races themselves. Though they follow the same standard naming schemes of “plates”, they still do have different types of plates depending on the months/seasons they are raced in. Likewise, the prize pool variates in correspondence with the plate names. When looking at the May 1905 races we see that there is a lot more at stake here. It practically dwarfs the others in terms of monetary value in the first and second place prize earnings. Likewise, it seems that in July 1905 there was a very significant drop-off in the prize earnings. It went from about 60k to just under 10k. This may be due to a reduction in the prize earnings due to popularity or simply could be because of less overall races. Luckily I have this data and interestingly enough, they both have the same races. It is 6 for both, meaning July was really just a year that awarded a lot less money for first place This is consistent even when compared with other dates. However, Monday is still an anomaly since it greatly exceeds any other prize offerings from the other months. The months of March 1906, October 1906, and July 1907 are what I would consider to be very average months. They have nothing special between any of them in terms of prize pools for both first and second place. This leads me to believe that May 1905, October 1905, and February 1907 …","date":1576195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576195200,"objectID":"37873f7899046da8b0840179edd65dc7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-roche/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-roche/","section":"post","summary":"Horse racing in Egypt during the early 1900s appeared to be an interesting sport of study to me.

They described the pupils there as well as gave the readers insight into some of their hardships as well as how they improved from last year’s performance. Due to this, I can also safely assume that this must be something that regularly occurs since this is the fifth time they have had such an entertainment. As stated, the writer is very candid and explains the downfalls and concerns they had over the performance. For example, the chorus sounded too forced and containing a lack of vibrancy. However, the writer did not only explain shortcomings. He also gave ample credit when he felt it necessary. This happened during a duet for the soprano and tenor which he labeled as “pleasant”, along with a violin solo which he said was given in a manner that was “most commendable”. It was also stated that this chorus came from Macbeth, which gives me insight into what the Egyptian audience liked to listen to at the time.\nWhile reading this article, I remember the blog post that I read before this. It is similar to this one, however, it looked at the individual artists and the culture rather than the performance as a whole. Nonetheless, it provided me with very helpful information, such as how the Egyptian musical culture is different from our own. He also found it interesting to see how the writers explain events such as what I noted with how candid they were. It does indeed make someone wonder if that is how the audience felt.

He also says that he is suffering from \u0026#34;other complications,\u0026#34; which may be anything from diabetes to heart disease to kidney failure.\nToday, a patient with the same symptoms would be likely diagnosed with chronic nephritis, which is an inflammation of the kidney. However, in the Thursday issue, it is mentioned that the Sultan was suffering from a stone. This means that he may have had a urinary tract infection. The most common cause of a UTI is Escherichia coli, or similar fungi. Other causes may include genetic predisposition or being uncircumcised. What exactly caused the Sultan to be ill is unknown, however, the diagnosis at the time was based on similar cases. Richard Bright attributed the disease to high blood pressure and diabetes, which could have been true in the Sultan\u0026#39;s case, as he mourned the recent death of two high functionaries, one of which \u0026#34;enjoyed his majesty\u0026#39;s confidence.\u0026#34;\n","date":1576195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576195200,"objectID":"1bd159c22911136641b07e3669ba8c38","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-13-jimmymendez/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-13-jimmymendez/","section":"post","summary":"THe Sultan was suffering from a disease which would not be as serious today","tags":["medicine","health"],"title":"The Sultan's Kidney Disease","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bailee Ku","Alvin Chen","Austin Kim","Jimmy Mendez"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Identifying Data Sets: Bailee Our group was primarily focused on the section of the Egyptian Gazette called Stocks and Shares, a table listing various companies and the prices of their respective shares. The companies are divided into various sections such as “banks,” “land,” “commercial/industrial,” “navigation \u0026amp; water works,” and “railways and tramways.” To select specific companies to analyze within each industry, I looked for one or two companies whose shares were listed in pounds (for ease of comparison- though it would be possible to convert from one type of currency to another, it was simpler this way), then picked the companies with the highest share prices. Choosing one or two companies with the highest share prices seemed like one possible way to find companies who were dominating those industries and could therefore provide an accurate assessment of Alexandria’s economy during a specific time period. The following eight companies were selected from those criteria: Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Fond., Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref., pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord., Alex. Water Company, Cairo-Helouan, and Keneh-Assouan. (For clarity, these names were lifted directly from the tables in question.)\nIntroducing the Datasource: Alvin With the selection of the eight companies above, we found that those companies can be distinguished into two categories.\nOne of them is finance, which includes Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Found, Alexandria Bounded Stores Pref, and Keneh-Assouan (Assurance). It is apparent that bank, insurance, and estate companies are likely to have more influence on the stock market, so we choose to observe them from a micro-scale, and then link them to the macroeconomics of Egypt. For instance, Ottoman Bank helped foreign interest groups to have their investments in Egypt. Its shares consisted of thousands of English Group and French Group. It also functioned as a loan provider by issuing loans to the government of Egypt.\nIt makes sense that the investors and businessmen in Egypt needed to borrow loans to develop and establish their industries to the emerging economics boom at the start of the 1900s. In return, the consumers and investors built up their credits and deposited their revenues to the bank, which allows the bank to have more power to promote regional development. As the economy boomed, the values of land prices increased. Daira Sanieh was a sugar company, and it also held many lands in North Egypt. During the booming, its lands were brought by several foreign investors. It used to have about 4 million Para (Ottoman Turkish currency) debt. After the sale of lands, its debt was paid off. On the sides of that, insurance companies had roles in decreasing the risk of the investors in the financial system and preventing the cost when companies have defaulted or failed to obligate the promise of paying back loans. Meanwhile, insurance companies hold large shares from other companies.\nThe second category is the infrastructure. In this project, we include Cairo Sewage Transport., Alexandria Water Company, and Cairo Helouan. In two decades, from 1880 to 1900, the population of Egypt had an exponential growth. The population in Alexandria grew half the amount of what it had in 1882. In 1907, it had 332,246 in Cairo. With the growth of population, more water installments and more transportation were needed to support the cities’ operation. The water was primarily relied on Suez and Niles. In major cities like Cairo and Alexandria, they had many railroads and tram companies serving for passengers and freight.\nProcess of Obtaining Preliminary Values Pre-Correction: Bailee In order to collect values from these companies, I ran the following XPath query:\n//div[@xml:id=”deg-el-stsh01”]/table//cell[contains(.,’Imperial Ottoman Bank’)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure\nThis particular query would deliver the share price (in pounds) for the Imperial Ottoman Bank in each properly labeled Stocks and Shares table within the content repository. (For reference, I updated my version of the content repository on November 13, 2019 at approximately 11 am.) I then took the search results and used Atom to isolate only the dates and share prices, then pasted them as separate columns in an Excel document. To obtain values from the other companies, I simply replaced the blue text with another company’s name and followed the same process. In this way, the XPath query for, say, Cairo Sewage Transport Ord. would be:\n//div[@xml:id=“deg-el-stsh01”]/table//cell[contains(.,‘pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord.’)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure\nRunning the query //div[@xml:id=”deg-el-stsh01”] showed 175 ocurrences of the Stocks and Shares table within the content repository.

Is it a horse? A grassy field? A shirt worn to a somewhat formal occasion? While the term is indeed applicable for all three of these, for the purpose of this analysis I will focus on the Polo relating to the first two. By this I am referring to one of the oldest sports to still be played today. Polo is a team sport where four members of each team mount their horses and, with mallets in hand, strive to direct a ball between a set of goal posts. The game is divided into four to six periods called “chukkers” lasting 7 minutes each.\nThe origin of the horseback sport can be traced back to Central Asia as early as 600 B.C. These nomads originated a variation of the game including teams with as many as 100 men to a side, with the main purpose of the sport being military training. After the nomads migration into Persia, polo became a national sport and its popularity blossomed. The invention of modern polo can be credited to British tea planters in Manipur, India, establishing the first polo club known as The Silchar Polo Club. This foundation set in 1859 quickly spread across Europe, becoming popular in Malta, England, and Ireland within a short period of time after its genesis. Polo became a very popular activity for militaries, especially once the game found its way to the United States for its ability to improve the riding skills of cavalrymen, teach leadership qualities, and develop camaraderie among troops. A further history of the sport can be found here The Egyptian Gazette highlights the sport quite often and it is without a doubt one of the more popular sports in the region. The Gazette makes reference to 12 teams over the span of 1906-1908 as well as four tournaments. My analysis project is set to discover which of these teams produce the greatest amount of “interesting games” as I would like to call them as well as if there is a relation to the amount of interesting games a team has to the spectator turnout for that team’s polo match. I will also be looking into the attendance for each of the four Major tournaments the Gazette reports on.\nStep 1: Methodology Over the course of this project, I set out to discover which team creates the most amount of what I like to call “interesting games.” I have classified these as games where the final score pins the teams within two goals of each other. For example, games ending 3-1 or 3-2 would be considered interesting. However, games ending 3-0, 4-1, etc. would not be classified as “interesting games.” Also, I did not include tie games into my “interesting games” category despite being within the two goal margin. A widespread opinion in modern sports culture is that tie games can ruin great events and I do believe in this to an extent. Therefore, for the purpose of this study they will not be included. While looking at which teams created the most interesting games, I plan on showing my results with the total amount of games played by each team to see the ratio of games played by a specific team resulting in “interesting games” to total games. Next, I will be looking into which teams gathered how many spectators. The Gazette often reports the amount of spectators, however I noticed it mostly mentions the crowd during tournament events and not single match friendlies. Hence why there will be more reported scores in my analysis than reported attendances. In this analysis, I will scale the attendance on a point based system giving 0.5 points for a “fair” crowd, 1.0 point for a “large” crowd, and 1.5 points for a “very large” crowd, while giving 0 points for events where attendance was failed to be reported. This will be known as a team’s “Attendance Score.” With the number of interesting games and Attendance score acquired, I will then compare the two to see 1. Which team provides the greatest quantity of interesting games, 2. Which team gathers the greatest amount of spectators, and 3. Is there a correlation between these two variables.\nFinally, I will use the same method as I did to find Attendance Scores for independent teams as I will for the major events, giving each event their own Attendance Score. I will then divide this by the maximum number of points possible to provide more accurate results. I will do this for if an event is shown for example 10 times in the newspaper and garners a 5 attendance score, than it will be evenly compared with another event shown 5 times that finishes with a score of 2.5. Despite, 5\u0026gt;2.5, the adjusted attendance score would conclude the two events to be equal in drawn attendance.\nStep 2: Querying My analysis resulted in two main query searches. Unfortunately, many of the authors of prior deliverables used different headings in their ‘div’ sections, with some not making the polo section its own ‘div’ all together. Therefore, I used the query //div[@type=“page”][contains(., “chukker”)] to search out all dates where there was a reported score for a match.

Seasonal changes, as well as the environmental changes that come with change in season, greatly affect aspects such as traveling and tourism throughout each year. According to the meteorological dates for seasons, the start of each season remains the same, however the end of each season changes slightly each year depending on how many days there are in the month. According to this Online Almanac, Spring starts March 1st and ends around May 31st, Summer starts June 1st and ends around August 31st, Fall starts September 1st and ends around November 30th, and Winter starts December 1st and ends around February 29th. I utilized the meteorological dates for the seasons because this website states that these dates are “based on the annual temperature cycle and the 12-month calendar.” This website also mentions that “climate scientists and meteorologists created this definition to make it easier to keep records of the weather, since the start of each meteorological season doesn’t change from year to year.” The meteorological dates are most useful for this research because the start of each season starts the same day no matter what year and these dates exist strictly for weather data.\nAccording to Wildland Adventures, Egypt’s main seasons are Winter and Summer, Egypt’s Winters are typically cold, windy, humid, and sometimes rainy whereas Egypt’s Summers are very dry, with very high temperatures. This website also states that the months April, May, October, and November are especially good for travelling. These reported most popular months for tourism fall in the seasons of Fall and Spring. With the data collected through an XPath Query, three line graphs and a series of bar graphs were created, demonstrating what months experienced more stays in hotels, which can be tied to tourism and how environment and seasons can affect travel in Alexandria.\nTo visually represent the number of individuals staying in hotels in Alexandria throughout the years 1905, 1906, and 1907, I used a specific XPath Query, organized my findings into Excel documents, and imported these Excel documents into Tableau. The data I collected was derived from using the XPath Query //div[@feature=\u0026#34;visitList\u0026#34;] and searching specifically for commas in this feature to detect all of the commas present in each listing of the Visitor’s List because the Visitor’s List feature provides all hotel visitor names separated by commas. This XPath Query is not one hundred percent correct and only provides estimates, since often in these features a husband and wife along with their shared last name are included before one single comma. Using this XPath Query allowed me to detect estimates of the quantities of individuals staying in hotels throughout each year. After collecting the quantities from each year, I transferred them into three separate Excel documents so that they could later be uploaded to Tableau. In addition to the the three line graphs separated by year, I have also created a visualization, separated by year and month, of the averages of the number of individuals staying in hotels throughout each month of the year.\nOnce I uploaded each of the three Excel documents into Tableau, I was able to create three separate line graphs that demonstrate the number of individuals residing in hotels in Egypt. To make these line graphs even more accurate, I recorded every instance in which there was a list of names in the Visit List feature. Since I recorded every appearance of this feature, I was able to label each specific date and number of commas on the line graph to make it easier to visualize the beginning and end of seasons. By looking at all four of the visualizations, I can state that the months January, February, March, and December seem to be the months that experienced the most tourism and populated hotels. The seasons that these months fall in are Winter and Spring. The months that experienced the least number of individuals staying in hotels were August, October, and November. This data proves the “Wildland Adventures” article wrong because they stated that the most popular months for tourism in Egypt are April, May, October, and November, where in reality the most popular months were actually January, February, March and December. By looking at what months that article thought were most active, I was able to deduce that they believed the most popular tourism seasons to be Fall and Spring.\nCaption Caption Caption Caption ","date":1576022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576022400,"objectID":"4d00abfa9a5dda96ffff8ae9c716048a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-rivera/","publishdate":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-rivera/","section":"post","summary":"Throughout the years 1905, 1906, and 1907 in Egypt, there was a visible fluctuation in the number of individuals staying at various hotels, such as the Luxor Winter Palace, Cataract Hotel Assouan, and the Savoy Hotel Assouan.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of Seasonal Change On Tourism and Hotel Stays","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tryfon Gerasimos Theophilopoulos"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"Doan’s Kidney Pills were originally advertised as “miracle pills”, which claimed to treat a variety of ailments. There were not a large quantity of advertisements that advertised to do a similar thing, but the main two were Doan’s Kidney Pills and Dr. William’s Pink Pills. Due to the fact that medicine at the time was still developing and overall understanding of illnesses was relatively unknown, actual medical professionals weren’t able to properly diagnose and treat many of their patients properly. This resulted in many individuals going and using these untraditional methods of treatment. In general, kidney function was not well understood, resulting in renal diseases being broadly categorized as Bright’s disease.\nDoan’s Kidney Pills When looking at the similar alternative to the Doan’s Kidney Pills, Dr. William’s Pink Pills were eventually realized for their true worth and removed from the market. I was originally expecting a similar result for Doan’s Kidney Pills, although it appears that these pills are actually sold today even. It appears at some point the deceptive and untruthful advertising was changed to only advertise for the true effects of the pill. Sometime during this timeline, the ingredients of the pills were switched from oil of jupiter \u0026amp; potassium nitrate to magnesium salicylate, a mild analgesic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The differences between the two are that potassium nitrate is used today mainly in explosives and fertilizers, whereas modern Doan’s Kidney Pills actually contain a substance that has been proven to help with pain and inflammation. It is frightening to see Doan’s Kidney Pills avoided the same fate as Dr. William’s Pink Pills, despite not being a placebo capsule and instead containing substances such as potassium nitrate which have been proven to cause violent gastroenteritis, anemia, methemoglobinemia, or even nephritis.\nSimilar blogs:\nMiraculous Medicine\nPink Pills for Pale People\n","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"94a8e15ec66d0b274e1b17fcc1f87cf3","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-12-10-tryfontheophilopoulos/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-10-tryfontheophilopoulos/","section":"post","summary":"An analysis of the progression of miracle pill advertisement throughout 1905, 1906, and 1907 as a means to make inferences about the overall progression of medicine and marketing of medicines","tags":["medicine"],"title":"A Look Into The History of Doan's Kidney Pills","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peyton Smith","Emily Seguin","Alain Hernandez","Mikayla Monaco"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Introduction The effect of climate change on the environment has been something of great controversy and debate in the media. This uncertainty regarding the topic sparked an interest in our group and that was to find the validity of these claims. Our ability to gather different aspects of the weather and relate them to each other was crucial in reaching the results that were acquired. In this project, the main goal is to analyze the weather and heat of the sun in Egypt from May 1906 to April 1907. The subcategories chosen will allow us to see what the impact of the heat of the sun is on subjects such as state of clouds, humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures. Most importantly, we are trying to deduce how all of these factors affect the living conditions in the country of Egypt. The main questions that will be answered is how the heat of the sun varies from May 1906 to April 1907 and how this impacts the humidity, state of clouds, average temperature of Alexandria, and maximum and minimum temperatures in other stations. The information needed to reach our results will be gathered from the Xpath Queries that will be listed below. This information will then be presented in a bar graph created in Tableau that shows the average heat of the sun monthly and will be compared to the other aspects that affect the climate to see which one plays the largest role. From this visualization we will be able to determine the significance of the data gathered and whether the heat of the sun and other factors of climate are connected in some way or another. Lastly, the results will be placed in historical context to see the importance of the results gathered and whether or not they are supported by the articles we have chosen.\nXPath Query For my query, I wanted to pick something that yielded good enough results regarding the Heat of the Sun measures in which we can properly use it in our research, so we’ve come up with this. XPath Query: //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr01\u0026#34;]/row[matches(.,\u0026#39;heat of the sun\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/cell[2]/measure/text(). In my query, I am limiting the results to only include those from the Daily Weather Report table, as with its corresponding ID. Once I’ve restricted it to the daily weather report, I needed to restrict it further to just the heat of the sun which I did here. I’ve noticed in some of the issues that some people capitalize the phrase “Heat of the sun” in various ways, so I made it case insensitive with the matches command. This query yielded 120 items, a lot more than what I had expecting and enough results for me to use research on however there were some discrepancies. In the earlier years, 1905 to mid-1906, there weren’t many holes and the data was pretty dense however as I began looking at the results past that, the data begins to thin out, making it hard to use the data. There are many different reasons why this might be. As ironic as it sounds, maybe the ‘Daily Weather Report’ never actually reported daily, or the students that had the days in which the data was missing never did them, there are several possibilities. As a result, I needed to restrict the timeframe of my research. My initial intent was to explore the heat of the sun index across all years however the data given made it near impossible to do that. Because of this, I’ve decided to restrict it to 1 year, where the data works best in and that was from May 1905 to April 1906.\nData Visualization Now that I have my query results, I needed to take my results and make a visualization out of it. Because my data was dense in my specified timeframe, doing an average of each month was the best thing to do in order to give a visualization of what my data represents as the sample size was large enough to accurately depict the indexes for each month. After putting the results in a spreadsheet, transferring it to Tableau, and averaging the measures per its corresponding month I’ve come up with this:\nInitial Bar Graph of Heat of the Sun Averages for each month. Although the visualization here is good, as it gives a good initial representation of the heat of the sun averages for each month, as you can tell the graph spikes in October 1906 and sinks in December 1906. As a result, I began to find out why this is happening and noticed that it was an error in the data source. In one of the days for October, the measure was 452, blowing the average way out of proportion. Likewise, with December, a day had a measure of 8, lowering the average. This wasn’t too big of a deal as we are only dealing with averages. Simply excluding the two days with the incorrect measures is all I needed to do in order to make the graph accurately representable of what we are trying to research, so that is what I did. After doing this, the graph looks like this:\nRevised Bar Graph of Heat of the Sun Averages for each month. As you can tell, the data flows much better as the months go by.

Being in front of their home fans, being on their most familiar field, and the overall convenience of home field has led to the common belief that the home team is at a measurable advantage. In the Egyptian Gazette, football (soccer) is one of the only sports with a distinct home and away team. For my individual analysis, I decided to explore this home and away data to answer the question: did home field advantage exist for football teams in early 1900’s Egypt, and why/why not? In order to find this data, I used the same queries which I used in the group project. One of the queries I used was //head[matches(.,’sport and play’, ‘i’)][matches(.,’the plague’, ‘i’)]. The purpose of these queries was to find every recorded football game possible in the newspaper. For each game I found, I recorded the issue date, home and away team, score, and attendance. Finding which teams were home or away seemed impossible at first, but I quickly realized that all of the recaps had the home team listed first. For example, if the section read “St. Andrew’s F.C. vs E.T.C. Suez,” it meant that St. Andrew’s F.C. was the home team.\nResults Every winning football team split by home and away This double-layered pie chart displays the winning team of every recorded game, separated by home or away. I found that across every game that did not end in a tie, the home team won nearly 75% of the time, or almost 300% more than the away team. Teams like St. Andrew’s F.C., E.T.C. Suez, and the Boulac Railway Institute had the most success at home, as they are the only teams with multiple home wins. St. Andrew’s played in the greatest number of recorded matches, so it is not too unusual to see them with 6 home wins. On the away side of the chart, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers are the only to get more than one win on the road. However, this disparity goes beyond simple win/loss statistics. Scores of every football game This stacked bar chart shows the home and away scores of every recorded game, along with an overlaid line chart of every game’s margin of victory. It is clear that most of the graph lies above the x-axis, on the home side. The reference lines show us that the average score of all away teams was 1.1 goal per game, while the home teams averaged 2 goals, nearly twice as much scoring per game. The most goals and highest victory margin for an away team in a game were accomplished by the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers when they stomped the King’s Royal Rifles 5-0. Other than this game, there are a few away teams who have won by 2 or 3 goals, but the majority of away wins are by just 1 goal.\nConclusion So, what exactly is the reason for this seemingly enormous difference in home and away team performance? One reason could be the way that games are scheduled. In recreational sports leagues like this one, most of the time the better or at least more established teams are granted home field, while the worse or less known team must travel. This would mean that the home teams are almost always the better team before the game even starts. This explanation is plausible, but the data does not include any teams with much more home than away games. Another reason could be for the simple fact that players on the home team do not have to travel like the away players do. Depending on how far each game was, travelling to away games is inconvenient and can disrupt a player’s internal schedule or readiness. Home teams obviously do not travel, so they are able to rest, practice, or otherwise prepare during this time. Finally, this data disparity could also be due to the most common explanation for home field advantage: the fans. While this is certainly true for most major sporting events, these games were very recreational and did not have a huge number of spectators. Of the 13 games which recorded attendance, only five had over 2000 people, all of which were very anticipated games between prominent military units. Rather than a single factor causing the home and away disparity, I believe that it is due to a combination of everything stated above. It is possible that while most teams played roughly the same number of home and away games, teams still scheduled easy games on their home field. I do not believe that simply traveling to another field could have such a large impact on its own, but it does have a perceivable effect and could easily play a role in this. Although there were relatively low numbers of attendance, over 1000 fans could definitely have an impact on the game’s outcome. However, as previously mentioned these are recreational competitions, meaning there probably are not over 1000 fans who care enough to get loud at most of the games. Overall, I believe that the massive difference in the performance of home and away teams is caused by a combination of home teams intentionally being better, away teams having to travel, and the home fans.\n","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"699859e7ff43fe3c1e09e56eddd7e720","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-reynolds/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-reynolds/","section":"post","summary":"Every athlete loves to play on their home field, and it’s easy to see why.

Like Anchor Line Limited, Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co., Deutsche Levante-Linnie, The Ellerman Lines, Limited, British India S. N. Company, Limited. The Moss S.S. Company, Ltd., Bibby Line Mail steamers.\nBy noting the amount of people that arrive and depart from different locations, I can get a nice look at how the population is changing. Then by checking the differing numbers in the lodging of Alexandria I can get a nice look at how many tourists are coming in and out of Alexandria, Egypt. Furthermore, by compiling these findings into a quarterly consensus to decide how the quarterly stocks and shares numbers will differ, this will make a nice conclusion as to how the amount of tourism during certain seasons will affect the fluctuation of certain Stocks and shares prices.\nTo do this I had to query a ton for quantifiable numbers. First, I queried for departures and arrivals to and from Alexandria, Egypt with the Anchor Line Limited, Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co., Deutsche Levante-Linnie, the Ellerman Lines Limited, British India S.N. Company Limited. Sudan Government Railway and Hamburg-Amerika Linie. I queried for the header of these companies’ names in page 1 results because that’s where I found the best results. These findings were compiled to depict that during the first and the fourth quarters of the year there are the most arrivals and departures. Where there are significantly more arrivals at the middle of November and the most departures at the end of March. I tried to conclude why this was the case and found that the prices of fares and tickets were a bit more expensive during these months, which makes sense. But what stood out the most was when I queried for the Daily Weather Report of these months and found that the weather was significantly more tourism appealing. During the months of December through March in Egypt the weather is Mediterranean like, with a cool temperature, windy at times and occasional rain, which makes for a beautiful tourist vacation.\nThen I queried for the tables under the header of a manufacturing company moving steamships with goods and services in the tons. I targeted headers like Prince Line and The Moss S.S. Company Limited during each quarter and found varying numbers for these as well that are evident of an increase in business for the first second and fourth quarters of the year. This is parallel to the influx of population during that time.\nLine Graph of Prince Line during the four quarters of the years 1905-1907 Then when I look at the results of my group’s findings and visualizations of the Stocks and Shares tables with the supporting query results of the Transportation of people, movements of goods and lodging vacancies. I found that these are parallel to the fluctuation of Stocks and Shares. Although the Stocks and Shares tables do not vary that frequently at the spots where they are most fluctuating correspond to the influx of people and goods during the first and fourth quarter. These stocks and shares are generally flat and at about the beginning of November and January is when the values have a pretty volatile spike upward. Then at about the end of February the stocks and shares values start to drop back to where they were. All of the stocks and shares followed this trend almost precisely, not just the companies that my group chose.\nAfter making this analysis I would conclude that due to the ideal weather circumstances during the wintertime there is a mas influx of people coming in and out of Alexandria, Egypt. Because of this increased transportation it has caused a need for more goods and services to be transported in and exported as well. These marketing factors have led to a rise in Stocks and Shares values during the first and fourth quarters of the year.\n","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"010c56d7b5719bbfe9d1baeef48afe3f","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-piraino/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-piraino/","section":"post","summary":"My group’s analysis of the Egyptian Gazette is focused on the Stocks and Shares tables.

Therefore, when I noticed the many ads for different insurance companies in the Egyptian Gazette newspaper, it sparked a topic for me to put my concentration toward, learn more about, and do my analysis project on.\nWHAT IS INSURANCE vs WHAT IS ASSURANCE ”Insurance is an agreement in which and individual pays a company to protect him/her from possible loss or damage, can be a property loss or financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.” The belief has been formed that during the time the Egyptian Gazette was first being issued that the idea of insurance was first being created. One of the primary things I noticed while I was using the ‘Find/ Replace’ tool in oxygen to skim through the newspaper for insurance ads, were that there were a lot of different ads for not only insurance firms, but assurance firms as well. Following the research I did, my understanding concludes that assurance is basically just another form of insurance. The rates, policies and procedures are different, but they both fill a similar need. Insurance alludes to a coverage over a limited period of time, whilst assurance pertains to continuing coverage for extended periods of time or in some cases until death. As a matter of fact, I noticed that in the newspaper many insurance ad squares advertise both forms by placing two firms of diverse specialties in one square. For example, the Royal Insurance Company is quite often gathered with the Phoenix Assurance Company in their ad square. Therefore, I presumed that both organizations either cooperate with one another or they are associated with each other in some way to almost always consume the same space.\nINSURANCE FIRMS AND THEIR SPECIALTIES A large portion of my research was completed by utilizing the XPath search functions’ like ‘Find/ Replace’ tool in oxygen and reading information from different online sources. In this analysis report I will discuss what my results were, some of the different steps in my research process and analysis, and a few different ways to proceed with this study given what information I have now. I began my analysis by utilizing the XPath steps to find the words ‘insurance’ and ‘assurance’, so I could come across each different insurance and assurance firm mentioned throughout the newspaper issues that I have completed. Here are a portion of the core searches that produced the most results:\n//div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//head[contains(.,\u0026#34;Insurance\u0026#34;)] //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//head[contains(.,\u0026#34;Assurance\u0026#34;)] //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;]//p[contains(.,\u0026#34;surance\u0026#34;)] In this approach, I basically skimmed through every paragraph \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; and header \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; for “insurance” and “assurance”. Most of the results came from either the first two pages of any issue or the last two pages, in the form of advertisements. Looking anyplace else brought integrated results like; mentions of insurance within headers were rare outside pages 1-2; however, looking inside different sections brought a bit of triumph. Each result came in the form of articles. While a few firms were referenced in the articles, I chose to limit my concentration to the advertisements, as the articles’ information regarding firms was not adequate for the sort of analysis I wanted to endure.\nBelow is the list of the insurance and assurance firms, their specialties, and their founding years.\nDATA VISUALIZATIONS Insurance firms in the Gazette were rated highly in the Insurance Almanac. Therefore, I tried to see whether there was a relationship between an insurance firm’s success and its pervasiveness in the newspaper (all thirteen firms were in the almanac). A number of firms mention their funds in their ads, though, so that would be my second parameter, and a more objective one at that. Here are the numbers of times a company’s ad showed up in the Gazette, utilizing XPath to check the quantity of valid objectives:\nCONCLUSION I was not impressed with my outcomes. Choosing to center my research and data through the advertisements not giving myself enough time to fully develop my findings, may have been the reason for my poor outcome. I believe that a more profound analysis of this topic requires great comprehension of history and finance (a skill I do not have). However, I did notice that there are some other directions that this study can take with regards to insurance in the Gazette that may lead to more substantial analysis projects, like using “The Reuter’s Telegrams and Share List tables.”\n","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"d97961c4d25c0b9042044149de2ccf08","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-douglas/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-douglas/","section":"post","summary":"After completing my Bachelors in Spanish and Commercial Entrepreneurship, I plan on earning my Masters in Health Administration and hopefully opening up my own health insurance company.

I chose to investigate the timeline of May 1906 to April 1907 with the hopes of finding whether or not there are correlations between the temperature of each location themselves. In combination to this, I also will make inferences between why some stations are higher than others and how that can relate to how busy they are. With this in mind, I can further make inferences about foot traffic and how that affects pollution levels in more popular or less popular places, inherently affecting temperature data.\nThere were a couple of general questions that motivated me to focus on this topic. The general topic of my group analysis project had to do with looking at temperature change over the decades over the country of Egypt, so I knew I had to do something within those parameters. One guiding question I came up with is as follows: “Do the measures in the heat of the sun section from the ‘Daily Weather Report’ part of each issue of the newspaper flow accordingly throughout the months recorded and will this data bring about any sort of significance on other topics prevalent during this time in Alexandria?”\nI take a genuine interest in climate change as a global topic in the present, so seeing how it influenced and was reported in the past was something I was excited to learn more about. After I drafted this first question, I began to make inferences about what I thought would answer the question. Recalling the historical time period of the European and American Industrial Revolution, I drafted this next sub-question:\n“How do higher temperatures recorded in various stations around Alexandria change with the increase in industrialization measures? With the past two general questions in mind, I decided to combine them and some other smaller thoughts into the one big question that serves as a general guideline of the project. It is stated below: “With the investigation of the maximum temperature data taken from various issues of the Egyptian Gazette from May 1907-April 1908, what changes are clearly visible from location to location and how can these implications be discussed in a social climate?” Furthermore, let us continue the investigation by taking an interest in the XPath Query I used to find the basic data.\nXPath Query As far as the XPath Query goes, I wanted to make sure I chose a search that would funnel out all of the data I did not need, leaving me with relevant and applicable numbers. Using the entirety of the content folder from Github as the identification of sources I was searching from, I used the following query to find the maximum temperatures as recorded in different stations in Alexandria covered in issues of the Egyptian Gazette : //table//cell[contains(.,‘Max. Temp ‘)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/text(). This search will give me the results I need and exclude any irrelevant data, like minimum temperatures for example. Each issue of the Egyptian Gazette has a “Daily Weather Report” including a multitude of sources of information. Some of these sources include the “Maximum Temperatures” table, the “Minimum Temperatures” table, and more. Once I’ve restricted it to the daily weather report, I needed to restrict it further to just the heat of the sun which I did here. The last part of the query including the “text()” is something I included to leave the option open for me to further consolidate my research. Just for interest, I filled in vocabulary such as “population” and “climate” to learn more about the subject in context. But, the main usage for this part of the query is where I ended up figuring out how to search for the time period I was looking for. I got a little over 50 results from this query, which I thought was a pretty good number to work off of. Although my group and I originally decided to leave the data unrestricted because we thought a lot of tables would have holes in them, we decided to collectively and individually constrict the data to about a year’s time so we could make quick predictions about future weather reports across Egypt.\nData Visualization After gathering the data results from Oxygen, I then exported them into an Atom file and used regular expressions to eliminate unnecessary components. After this, I continued to export the edited Atom data to a spreadsheet which was then opened in Tableau. After playing around with the design of the graph and choosing the axes, I decided to make a side bar graph to display the results I felt would be most welcoming to the individual interpreting it. The visual is below:\nInitial Bar Graph of Heat of the Sun Averages for each month. My original plan was to create a couple of graphs displaying the average temperatures in each location as recorded in the Egyptian Gazette , but while deciphering the data from Oxygen, I changed my mind.

Egypt and Alexandria in particular were still under British rule, as can be seen through the Egyptian Gazette, which is a primarily English containing newspaper marketed towards the British in the surrounding Egyptian areas as well as those who dealt with these individuals on a primary basis. In conclusion, this newspaper was made for the rich imperialists in control. Because of this, many different European and British influences can be seen within the Egyptian Gazette, one of which being certain medically affiliated advertisements. Two advertisements which caught my eye in particular were ones advertising Dr. William’s Pink Pills as well as Doan’s Kidney Pills.\nThese pills were marketed as miracle pills that would be able to cure essentially any ailment that one encountered, including but not limited to kidney disease, heart palpitations, anxiety, stress, weakness, pain, backache, anaemia, clinical depression, poor appetite, and even cancer at one point. The funny part about the absurdness of the entire sales pitch?- they consisted of only iron oxide and magnesium sulfate. When looking into a study conducted by Reyhaneh Kheiri, et al., they found that iron oxide had no real positive effect on the body, and iron levels only slightly increased depending on the dose between 1-6 hours following consumption. 12 hours following consumption, no iron level change could be observed. Magnesium sulfate, on the other hand, does have some health benefits such as prevent low magnesium blood levels as well as seizures in women. It is almost unexpected that this compound also fails to treat any of the illnesses and conditions that these miracle pills claim to cure.\nSo what’s the catch? The simple answer is that these pills are entirely based on placebo and were such a large success due to the overall failure to understand medicine and pathology as we do today in modern medicine as well as the clever marketing that has been implemented not only in Egypt, but also worldwide during the selling of these pills. My analysis project deals primarily with the medical terminology which was employed in order to successfully market these “miracle pills”\nTo begin my analysis, I first had to find suitable advertisements that I would be able to use for this nature of a project. My main issue that I encountered was that most of the time, advertisements remain the same or only change once or twice throughout their lifetime in the Egyptian Gazette. This severely limited the advertisements that I would be able to use for this project, as I had to find more dynamic ones which were constantly changing on a daily or even monthly basis depending on the prevalence and frequency of them in the newspaper. I finally cut down all of the candidates I was originally looking at down to two: Dr. William’s Pink Pills \u0026amp; Doan’s Kidney Pills.\nThese advertisements seemed to be very different from other advertisements within the Egyptian Gazette in a couple different senses which made them perfect candidates for this embarkment. The main reason was because these advertisements often did not find themselves coming up within the main advertisement sections at all. The places that I found these advertisements were within actual bodies of text where stories and other items would be found. This meant that instead of being a reoccurring identical template, it changed constantly. In addition, because of this constant dynamic aspect that the advertisements had, they were often formatted in the form of a testimonial to make it seem less like a product being sold and more like an actual account from a civilian just like one who may be reading the newspaper, increasing their overall authenticity to the reader. In the end, this entire con is just a marketing scheme to make money, and it appears that these antics worked for a reason I will expand on when showing the data.\nProcedural Method for Obtaining Results Firstly, due to the nature of these advertisements not actually being put into a advertisement div, I had to form my Xpath Query slightly differently so that it would find the instances of the title of the pills. I also was required to keep the Xpath Query fairly basic as narrowing it down in various ways resulted in not flagging positives as it should have been. For example, there was no template for these advertisements due to the fact that, once again, they were constantly changing throughout the Egyptian Gazette. The two queries that I used to create a database were the following:\n//div/div/p[contains(., ‘Pink Pills’)]\n//div/div/p[contains(., ‘Doan’s Kidney Pills’)]\nAfter moving all of the div’s into a plaintext file, I separated them by year and began looking for patterns and certain terminology that I deemed important and observed repeating …","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"23fb394102b79ac6dc7de789154982cc","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-theophilopoulos/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-theophilopoulos/","section":"post","summary":"An analysis of the progression of miracle pill advertisement throughout 1905, 1906, and 1907 as a means to make inferences about the overall progression of medicine and marketing of medicines","tags":["medicine"],"title":"Medical Terminology as a means of analysis for the progression of medicine in Egypt and the British Empire","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tryfon Gerasimos Theophilopoulos","Oscar Naranjo","Jake Himmel","Breanna Heflin","DamamliDorsey"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Many diseases that emerged in the 19th century included cholera, yellow fever, typhus, smallpox, and many more. However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that weak medical practices became outdated. Before these breakthroughs there was only a basic understanding, which furthermore, commercialized the industry by selling medications with little to know regulation utilizing public fear and desperation. Many campaigns and ads sold the idea of “bad blood” being the cause as these medications were claimed to generate new blood and purify the body. Obviously, we know this is not real science but then, it was all the people knew and believed in regards to infectious diseases that were on a constant rise in the 1900s.\nMedical Terminology Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills: Doan’s Kidney Pills Data Analysis From this data, I was able to learn and infer a couple of different things. The first thing that stood out to me was the amount of times the advertisements for these “miracle pills” would come up throughout the Egyptian Gazette. For example, when looking at instances of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, in 1905 there were only 16 occurrences of the advertisement. In 1906, that number increased slightly to 19 instances. Then, in 1907, the number skyrocketed to 45 different instances of that advertisement throughout the year in the Egyptian Gazette. When looking Doan’s Kidney Pills, a similar jump can be observed in the Egyptian Gazette. In 1905, 11 instances were recorded, in 1906 12 instances were recorded, and in 1907 the number shot through the roof. This clearly goes to show that the success surrounding these pills was flourishing as much more money was able to be put towards advertising following what I believe was a good year or two of selling their product. I also believe that this is due to this relatively new method of advertising which implemented personal testimonials to sell the product.\nOther patterns that I observed from this data was regarding exactly why many of these terms decreased in frequency over the three year time span. I believe after looking at the data and taking a detailed look into what types of treatments that the pills were offering that as medicine became slightly more advanced over this time period, these advertisements began to vouch for treating less and less serious ailments. They instead appear to move towards more general symptoms, the primary one being pain. These advertisements saw an increase in the prevalence of “pain” as pain can be associated with various illnesses, allowing them to generalize to more diseases without distinctly claiming to cure one or the other. As actual treatments for certain illnesses became available, these “miracle pills” began to advertise less towards specific ones and more for general symptoms.\nAnother example of this move towards a better understanding of modern medicine can be seen in the word “blood”. I observed a decrease in the word blood within both advertisements, primarily because medicine was becoming more advanced as actual understanding of the body and pathogens slightly deepened. It was a common misconception that many ailments were caused by an impurity in the blood, and that a way to get new blood was a way to prevent further illnesses. These pills claimed to give “new blood” to the user, although this logic is clearly flawed by today’s understanding. As the understanding of pathology increased during this time period, we can also see a decrease in the word “blood” coming up in the newspaper, leading me to believe that this assumption of blood impurities became less prevalent as other more accurate explanations for illnesses arose.\n?As for the application of these results to the group project, it ties in strongly with the other topics in the sense that we are able to apply these results to the work of the other topics within this project. For example, by looking at prevalence of words in advertisements, we can infer that certain ailments that are commonly found within the miracle pill advertisements likely also are symptoms of larger diseases that medical schools and hospitals are dealing with. We are able to get a sense for what is affecting the larger population and tie this in by looking at the proper ways that these illnesses and symptoms are being treated.\nMedical Schools and the Diseases Found The correlation between the location of medical schools and hospitals with the diseases that were being researched at these medical facilities. By finding if these diseases were prevalent in certain areas, it may be concluded that the disease was being researched at a prominent medical institution. The first disease found was Tropical Disease which is mentioned in the Gazette four times. Three of these times were cases within Cairo and the last one was found within Sudan. While this data is not enough to say there was an epidemic, it may be enough to deduce that these areas were experiencing hardships from this disease.

As the sports group, we decided to focus our analysis project on the different factors which can affect spectator turnout across the major sports of the Egyptian Gazette. Among residents of early 1900’s Egypt, three of the most popular sports were football (soccer), polo, and horse racing. By looking into the data that we have collected for these sports, we are able to get an idea of what Egyptian sport fans wanted to see. Through our analysis of the Egyptian Gazette data and cross-checking with multiple studies on attendance of various sports, we have concluded that in early 1900’s Egypt, there were three major factors of sports attendance: level of competition/skill of either side, rivalry between the two sides, and importance/stakes of the competition.\nThe question of how to get fans in attendance of sporting events is nothing new; as long as there have been sports, there have been those in charge trying to increase attendance. Especially recently, sporting events provide a large stream of revenue, so factors which influence attendance are important information for those involved in sports. Experts and researchers, such as John Douvis and Peter Bird, have tried finding these factors in many different ways across a wide range of sports. These publications are looking at current factors, of which many do not apply to early 1900’s Egypt, however common themes across generations have held true.\nIn order to collect this data, we ran a series of XPath queries aimed at finding as many games as possible for each sport. We searched for the “sport and play” sections of the newspaper, where sports data and stats are most often found. One problem we came across was that many of the sport and play sections were not tagged with the sport feature type. To combat this, we removed //div[@feature=”sport”] from our queries and replaced it with //head[matches(.,’sport and play’, ‘i’)]. What this did was return to us any div with the header “Sport and Play,” which only included sport and play sections. We utilized this along with searching for sport-specific terms like “chukker” (polo) to collect the full data range that was available to us. We also realized that many sections use qualitative descriptions instead of numbers for attendance data. These sections often used the same terms, such as “fine,” “large,” and “very large,” so we recorded these descriptions anyway.\nFootball Football was one of the most popular sports at the time, often played between different military regiments or schools. The military teams, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, were split into teams or “companies,” although they did sometimes compete together. This brings us to our first factor of attendance, level of competition. Attendance of each football game When looking at the attendance data for these games, the effect of this factor becomes clear. The matches with high attendance are all between two of the military unit teams at full strength, and not divided into companies. Matches between two of the subdivided units, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers F. and D. Companies, tended to have much less attendance than the more high-profile competitions. This, of course, is logical because more fans are going to be willing to attend a game if it is between two good teams. The research of Peter J. W. N. Bird on league football attendance also supports this factor. In “The Demand for League Football,” Bird looks at various teams and determined that whether or not the team was a contender during the season or a contender for the play-offs was a highly significant factor with a strong positive relation to attendance. Continuing with this first factor, the skill level of the away team appears to also play a role. Football attendance vs margin of victory The data above shows that there was significantly higher attendance in games where the away team had a bigger the margin of victory (shown by the points below 0). This correlation is strikingly direct, and displays an positive relationship between attendance and away team performance. This suggests a number of things, but we concluded the reason for this trend is that when a good team is in town, fans in the area would be likely to attend the game. Often, teams would have large gaps between games at the same away location, so fans understood that each of these games was the last time they could see the team for a while. This is supported by Hal Hansen and Roger Gauthier, who in 1989 researched and collected 40 different factors which impact attendance.

This information was gathered conducting an Xpath query on the Egyptian Gazette between the years 1904-1907.

The answers to these questions will be collected from in-depth research within the pages of the Egyptian Gazette from the years 1905 and 1907. In doing so I will integrate charts and graphs of where and when occurrences were the most often. To conduct this research, formulating an Xpath query was necessary to produce results. Words such as “plague”, “bubonic”, and “bubonic plague” were put in find/replace in files in Oxygen Editor restricting it to the following Xpath: //div[@type=“page”][@n=“3” or @n=“4” or @n=“5” or @n=“6”]/div[not(@type=“advert”) or (@type=“advertisement”)]/p. What this Xpath query does is that it looks under the first two div located only in pages 3, 4, or 5 of the newspaper for a certain word or phrase inside a paragraph that must not be an ad. Knowing that pages one and two are full with ads and so are the last two, the xpath query ignores those pages.\nHowever, doing just this will end in hundreds of thousands of useless results. Therefore, three different working sets were created which were configured to only include files from one year. In other words, the Xpath stated above was ran separately on each year. The outcome from this search then revealed useful information that was then applied to formulate graphs and maps shown below as well as theoretical responses to my questions regarding the Third Pandemic spread.\nThe earliest records of the Bubonic Plague within The Egyptian Gazette was found on January second of 1905. However, according to history, the first outbreaks of the plague in Egypt took place back in April of 1899 after a long time of disease-free (Plague In Egypt). Here is a quick description from the Egyptian Gazette itself of what the bubonic plague was, how it spread, and examples of incidents.\n“It appears from the report that I have received from Dr. Cresswell and from my own observations, (says Sir H. Pinching in his report) that these cases are due to infection conveyed by rats, which had been infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt. One of the persons attacked by plague at Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta and tea from Madras. In moving the cases containing these goods the dead bodies of rats were found.” (1905-01-02.xml)\nIn spite of the exposure to the plague in other regions or nations, the economy and thus trade did not stop. The Egyptian government, did not want to interrupt trading among allies as it would cause severe economic problems (Plague In Egypt). After the terrifying news spread through the country, precautions were taken in ports of other countries, “A telegram from Constantinople of yesterday states that arrivals from Alexandria are submitted to a medical examination and disinfection, while rats on board ship must be destroyed”(1905-06-19). Based on my research throughout the newspaper, as you can see above, the way the Bubonic plague spread in Egypt was through the trade ports from Delta or Upper Egypt. Although rats are blamed here, it was actually through infected fleas humans got the plague as they sucked blood from the infected rats and then bit humans.\nSo when was this vast plague the worst? In other words when and where was it the most frequent. To answer these questions, lots of exhaustive research was performed. As previously stated, the words “plague”, “bubonic”, and “bubonic plague” were used in my query. After analyzing the text, the newspaper contained a section with weekly reports of the amount of incidents across Egypt as well as in other parts of the world, stories, and more. The following bar graph was constructed using my findings.\n(NOTE: Bar graph data not exact to real numbers, yet it is an accurate small-scale representation).\nIn comparison with 1904, as the bar graph shows, there was a considerable diminution in the number of cases of plague in Egypt as in the year of 1905. However, the following year, 1906, the plague spread and the number of cases severely increased. Real estimates are said to be the following:\n“The total number of cases notified since the beginning of the year amounted to 464 against …","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"69787f52de7170bf5fd7c50d263f9796","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-naranjo/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-naranjo/","section":"post","summary":"The goal of my post is to answer questions such as the reasons behind the spread of the Bubonic Plague across Egypt, what cities were the most affected and why, and what actions were taken to cease it.","tags":null,"title":"Bubonic Plague","type":"post"},{"authors":["Nangelis Rivera"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"As I was completing my deliverables and combing through page images, I came across an interesting article in the “Letters to the Editor” section of the June 14, 1907 issue of the Egyptian Gazette. In this article, an individual described their experience in which their gentle dog was harmed and seized, right as they were about to get into their home, simply because it was not wearing a muzzle. In this time in Egypt, it was required for dogs to wear muzzles in public, but this individual was not able to place a muzzle on their dog because it was so small and no muzzle would fit it. The typical punishment for dogs not wearing muzzles in Egypt was death. As this individual went through the process of getting their dog back, they witnessed a vast area and said it was “like searching for pins in the Catacombs.”\nThe treatment of dogs in Alexandria was completely different than the treatment of dogs in today’s society. Today we treat dogs as if they are our own children and only muzzle them if they show aggressive tendencies. In Alexandria, if any dog, no matter how small, nice, or cute, was seen without a muzzle in the open, the police would hit them, or kill them, and even seize the dogs and contain them in an ironic facility labelled the “Infirmary : Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.” The individual that submitted this letter did not understand Arabic, so they could not understand what two police officers were trying to tell them before the writer’s dog was seized or even the papers that needed to be signed before the dog went back into the writer’s custody. This type of treatment would not be accepted today in the United States since pets have become so near and dear to humans. Pets are now even ironically used as police dogs all around the world, contrary to the letter that discussed how police were abusive towards dogs.\nIn this blog post, someone discussed this same letter, “Police Dog Service” and stated that someone responded to this letter agreeing with the writer and stating that dogs should be treated better, especially as they get closer to passing away. However, in this time period in Egypt, dogs were not commonly thought of as dearly as they are now, so they were kept in terrible conditions and left to die a horrible death. In another blog post, I saw even more evidence of how dogs were yet again mistreated and not cared about as much as they are today. The creator of this blog post mentioned that they discovered that there was a section in the Egyptian Gazette titled “Stray and Ownerless Dog” that provided little information on the actual dog and when they were set to be poisoned. In this time period in Egypt, if dogs were found and did not seem to have an owner, a vague announcement was made and as a form of controlling the overpopulation of dogs, they were euthanized right as they were caught. Today, we provide owners with a longer time to find their lost dog and if a dog does not have an owner and is in a no-kill shelter, workers at the shelter try their hardest to advertise the dog so that it can find a loving home. This is interesting because we can see the development of the relationship between man and man’s best friend in the United States in the early 1900s and Egypt in the 1900s, Americans have domesticated dogs and thought of them as family members whereas Egyptians saw them as a hassle and pests. According to an Online Blog, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dogs were still not as near and dear to individuals as they are now. Dogs were kept mostly for completing tasks such as hunting, not usually for enjoying their company and having a companion.\nThrough reading these blog posts about how dogs were mistreated in twentieth century Egypt, I decided to conduct more research to see if the treatment of dogs has improved today in the twenty-first century. I first found an Egyptian News Article that discussed the cruelty of the Egyptian government towards dogs. Since Egypt is overpopulated by dogs, the government poisons the food by stray dogs and leaves them to die and lay in the street. There have even been rumors that the Egyptian government has shot dogs and lets them lay in their own blood on the ground. Through reading this Egyptian News Article, it is obvious that Egyptians in the twenty-first have the same disregard and cruelty towards dogs as Egyptians in the twentieth century. In this Article, a positive light is shed on the relationship between Egyptians and dogs as it highlights the useful tasks that dogs helped humans with. According to this article, dogs were seen as very productive in the Egyptian community because they assisted with hunting, protection, and herding livestock. Contrary to the writer of the “Police Dog Service” article in the Egyptian Gazette, this article on the relationship between individuals and dogs in Egypt states that “ottoman officials indeed actively encouraged the increase and maintenance of dog populations by providing them with food and …","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"24c7ed8af15341ab94f936db03b8e9e4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-17-nangelisrivera/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-17-nangelisrivera/","section":"post","summary":"Someone was just about to enter their home when their miniature, harmless dog was attacked by a man because it was not wearing a muzzle.","tags":["Police","Animals"],"title":"Discrimination Against Dogs in Egypt","type":"post"},{"authors":["Damamli Dorsey"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"The goal of my analysis project was to discover where medical schools were located within Egypt and what diseases where occurring near these schools. I then wanted to know if the occurrences of these disease in correlation with a certain school of medicine, would mean that the disease was an epidemic for that region. I wanted to know this because if the disease was found to be researched in these medical schools and hospitals In the Egyptian Gazette the term medical school is not common but the term school of medicine is. Using this term, I was able to find 53 items concerning this term. Many of these articles where talking about how there were meetings at these schools but there were no indicators about what disease may have been in the area. Upon further searching, I was able to find words such as Tropical Disease, Trypanosomiasis, and Sleeping Sickness which helped me to further my search in to the diseases effecting which areas. Also, I began to search for Kasr-el-Ainy, Gordon College and Laboratories in order to have a clearer view on where these diseases may have been treated at in addition to the medical schools. I planned to use an excel spreadsheet to record the data I find on each disease and what medical school or hospital is treated that disease. After looking at that, I will use visualizations such as a map and a bar graph to show how many times a certain disease was talked about in an area.\nThe first term I looked for was Tropical Disease because it was shown to be treated at both a school of medicine and the Kasr-el-Ainy which were in Cairo. I used this X-path query //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][matches(., \u0026#34;Cairo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)], to find the amount of occurrences where tropical disease and Cairo were mentioned together. I was only able to find three times where both terms were mentioned together. In one article, the writer was explaining how one school of medicine was being built in order to investigate the cause of Tropical Disease within the area of Alexandra and Cairo. Another article gave a brief description of the Tropical Disease which was seen to be caused by germs. Though I found information about what the disease was, I was unable to find the effects of the disease on the people in Alexandra and Cairo. The lack of description about Tropical Disease may stem from the fear that the disease may cause a decrease in the white male community. For example, one article called the Our Letter to London, (May 18, 1905); explained how the Tropical Disease would be the real enemy of the white man if the disease was to spread. The article talked about how in order to preserve the prosperity of the empire, Tropical Disease would need to be cured with “tropical medicine” that would need to be researched by the medical school and laboratories. Another article titled, Proposed Tropical School of Medicine (May 22, 1906); Tropical Disease is starting to be investigated by the Kasr-el-Ainy Hospital in order to find ways for the disease to be cured Cairo and Alexandra. This led me to my next search for the correlation between laboratories and tropical disease, in order to see what areas, the laboratories were in and if the were studying tropical disease. I was only able to find one instance in the newspaper where Tropical Disease was begin researched by a laboratory. I used these X-path queries //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][matches(., \u0026#34;Sudan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)] and //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][matches(., \u0026#34;Gordon College\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;)] to find any occurrences where Tropical Disease was found in Within the Local and General Section of November 27, 1906, I was able to find a passage about the Gordon College Laboratories. The Gordon College Laboratories was the only laboratory I found to researching the tropical disease, but the research on the disease was being conducted in Sudan and not Cairo or Alexandra. I found this to be very interesting best the disease traveled within the year but there was still no concrete information about the disease expect for the fact that it was affecting animals and humans. I was unable to find any advertisements for treatment of tropical disease, but I believe that this lack of advertisements stems from the fears of the British in Egypt of the disease causing a lack of tourism and trade.\nAnother disease called Trypanosomiasis was mentioned when I started to research Gordon College Laboratories. This disease was affecting Sudan and was seen to be a secondary disease stemming from sleeping sickness. I used this X-path query: //div[@type=“item”][matches(., “Sudan”, “i”)] and //div[@type=“item”][matches(., “Gordon College”, “i”)] to find where sleeping sickness was presence in Sudan, I then used this same query with Trypanosomiasis. There are 17 different occurrences in the paper of sleeping sickness in Sudan. Yet, I only found 3 occurrences of Trypanosomiasis in Sudan within the paper. I was only able to find one occurrence where Gordon College is mentioned with sleeping sickness and Trypanosomiasis.

I find this interesting because when an outbreak of anything happens today, the CDC for example, might send out a similar statement. What also interests me is the difference between the two organizations that would issue such a statement. In Alexandria, the sanitation department seemed to have authority over the control and prevention of disease spreading. This goes on to suggest that early 20th century disease control was thought to be based entirely on sanitation. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has authority over the research and prevention of infectious diseases.\nThe article says that its primary goal was to inform the readers of the preparations they can take to guard their own safe being. The following is what the article says the Sanitary Department Suggests:\nWash our hands after every visit to “lieux d’aisance” and each time before eating. Eat only well-cooked food; avoid altogether unfiltered water, uncooked milk and butter vegetables and fruits which can be neither cooked nor peeled. Avoid all excess of food, generally, and too cold drinks. Call in the doctor immediately on the slighted suspicion Watch your servants; do not allow them to go out without changing their clothes and washing their hands on returning; do not allow the boabs to have any persons not belonging to the building with them. These precautions are interesting because a lot of the suggestions are commonplace today. The second portion of the article describes the actions that the sanitary department will do to inspect the town of infectious diseases. They will inspect establishments and tell them to disinfect with carbonate lime. This will also result in a number of wells being closing down throughout the city.\nAt the end of the article, it is mentioned that a “Coastguard cruiser” is patrolling the waters of the Red Sea, to prevent pilgrims crossing into Egypt. This article was published towards the end of the Islamic Pilgrimage to Mecca. Also in this time period are many reports from Mecca of reports of Cholera. History also has also seen throughout the 19th century that cholera has spread from Mecca during Hajj. Therefore the coastguard trying to keep the pilgrims from entering Egypt might be a good way to keep Alexandria safe from the threat of cholera.\n","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"8a4a42ef752c8b32faaf15ec83f3faee","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-25-jake_himmel/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-25-jake_himmel/","section":"post","summary":"This article describes how Alexandria, Egypt is preparing for a potential Cholera Outbreak.","tags":["Disease","Cholera","Sanitation","Pilgrimage","Death","Disease Prevention","Sanitation Department"],"title":"How To Prepare for an Outbreak","type":"post"},{"authors":["Vanessa Grimaldo"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"For the analysis project, my group focused primarily on the environment in Egypt, and the various aspects of the environment. For my individual analysis, I’ve decided to focus on the mosquitoes in the environment in Egypt. I was curious as to how mosquitoes tied into the environment, more specifically if they were prevalent in the environment, what time of year mosquitoes seemed to come around and interfere with the daily lives of the individuals living in Egypt, and how they affected individuals and business in Egypt. After I found the various data, I created bar graphs to compare the data I found, and I strived to find connections and similarities in the different sets of data I was looking for.\nFirst, I wanted to discover the time of year that mosquitoes came around in Egypt. To do this, I decided to create an Xpath query to search for the number of paragraphs in which individuals in the Egyptian Gazette mentioned mosquitoes in the newspaper, by searching “count(//div[contains(., ‘mosquito’)]).” My thought process was that if people in the newspaper are mentioning “mosquitoes,” that must mean that mosquitoes are around, and more importantly affecting the people in Egypt. When I searched for these results, I found many instances of the word “mosquito,” and put it into Excel. My results were very consistent through the years 1905-1907, mostly finding prevalence in mosquitoes from December-March, with few inconsistencies. Although the word “mosquito” was found mostly in this time frame of months, the word “mosquito” was still mentioned throughout the year, just much less than from December-March. Because, for the most part, “mosquito” was mentioned at the same time each year, I can come to the conclusion that the number of times that word was mentioned directly correlates to the times of year that mosquitoes were around and affecting the population. Next, I wanted to study the various ways mosquitoes affected the individuals in Egypt. I conducted this research by searching online for this information. In this link, I found that work had been done in the history of Egypt to exterminate mosquitoes, beginning with studying the biology of them, and then figuring out different techniques to get rid of them completely. At first, people in Egypt drained oil in order to keep mosquitoes away from their environment, but there was a shift in how they got rid of them. Because Egypt is home to many deserts and dry areas, mosquitoes don’t seem to be very much around, except for the areas which have pools of water, where mosquitoes are most attracted. Through thorough research, I also found on this link that mosquitoes were reproducing heavily in 1904 and 1905, causing the Dengue disease, causing so many people to visit the hospital and this disease existed even throughout 1907, making it’s way through Cairo, but somehow avoiding Port Said and Ismailia. Mosquitoes were able to transmit this disease from man to man through sucking blood out of individuals. Clearly, mosquitoes were a large issue and affected many people in the town, as well as many businesses, like the hospital.\nAside from the hospitals, mosquito infestations made Calvert’s business boom. While coding the 1908 newspaper, I found that there were many Calvert’s advertisements that promoted various creams and ointments for sunburns, as well as mosquito irritability. I found these ads mostly in pages 1 and 2, however one advertisement was on page 5. I was curious as to what time of year these Calvert’s advertisements showed up in the Egyptian Gazette. My hypothesis was that they would show up at the same time of year as the word “mosquito” was mentioned the most in the newspaper. If mentioning “mosquito” many times in the newspaper meant that was when mosquitoes were affecting the population the most, the Calvert’s business would boom off advertising their products at the same time. So, I did a key word search for Calvert’s ads, and found, as I suspected, that the advertisements that promoted ointments for mosquito bites, showed up at the same times as the word “mosquito” was popular in the newspaper. I created bar graphs to clearly see the correlation between the word “mosquito” popping up in the newspaper, and the Calvert’s ad popping up in the newspaper.

In the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a cotton worm epidemic that greatly threatened the cotton plants across all the Egyptian provinces. The Khedive made a national decree that informed the public of the cotton worm menace, and contained a call to action for citizens to band together to combat the cotton worm. One way that Egypt went about protecting their harvests from the cotton worms was to conscript local children to go out into the fields and pick the cotton worms and cotton worm larvae off the plant stems by hand. From the years 1905 to 1907, thousands of children were enlisted to help save the harvests in every cotton containing province. The amount of land that was affected by the cotton worms is measured in feddans, an arabic unit to measure land. One feddan is just under the size of one acre (1 feddan=1.03 acre). Within the Egyptian Gazette, there is a copy of the Khedivial Decree of the cotton worm menace, many articles containing information about the amount of feddans affected by the cotton worm and how much of the land was cleansed by a certain number of children, and other articles relevant to the cotton worm situation. By examining the amount of land affected, how much of that affected land was picked free of cotton worms and larvae, and how many children were working to get rid of the cotton worms, the general success of the movement against the cotton worm from 1905 to 1907 can be determined.\nThe Khedivial Decree, found in the 1905-03-01 edition of the Egyptian Gazette, informs that the plants infested with the cotton worm must be stripped and burned. It outlines that any able-bodied men from ages 9 to 17 must work in the fields to cleanse the cotton worm for a minimum salary that matched the market prices. Any child that refuses to work or commits any act of negligence while working could be fined and thrown in prison for up to a week. The Khedivial Decree was originally published in French and was translated to English via Google Translate. The Khedivial Decree shows the serious nature of the cotton worm menace, and how it posed a critical threat to all of Egypt. By taking such extensive measures like child conscription, it is evident that the Egyptian authority realized the potential danger of the cotton worm and the necessity to take drastic measures to avoid an even worse outcome. Articles titled “The Cotton Worm” in the Egyptian Gazette pop up pretty often in the “Local and General” section of page 3 and detail the latest reports on the cotton worm infestation. Cotton Worm articles show how many feddans are affected, and how many were cleansed, and sometimes how many children were used to do the work. The data these articles provide is the main method in tracking the progress of the fight against the cotton worm. Most of the articles appeared in the months of July and August. Following are graphs of the amount of land that was attacked by cotton worm, how much was cleansed, and how many children were used to pick the worms. Note: for 1906 and 1907, there was no report of the number of children used in the combat of the cotton worm. Here is a map showing the Egyptian provinces. Spelling of the province names may slightly vary. There may be errors in the data due to cotton worm infestations that were not reported in the Egyptian Gazette, problems with OCR, the existence of articles that did not show up in any of the xpath queries, or various other forms of human error. Regardless, I believe that the graphs serve their purpose in giving a general understanding of when the cotton worm epidemic was most prevalent in Egypt from 1905 to 1907 and which provinces were most affected. It also gives an idea of the sheer number of local children that were conscripted to go out in the fields and pick the worms and larvae; in 1905 there were at least 250,000 children, although the real number is likely much higher. From 1905 to 1906, the amount of land affected by the worm seems to slowly decline, revealing a steady success from the worm picking and cotton burning conscripted force. 1907 shows a sharp decrease in the number of attacked and cleansed feddans, but I think this is extremely exaggerated from the truth because of data that has not yet been entered into the content repository.

In the essay, author Aaron Jakes tells of the cotton worm infestation that took root in 1904.

For this project my query search will be just focused on the word “billiards”. From this point on my search would narrow down to search for the word “club” within three words of the word “billiards”. This came with a very narrow list of outputs, allowing me to carefully analyze what types of individuals would be seen at these sporting events. In my experience the word “club” within a few spaces of any sporting event or game would likely mean that the sporting event brought in a relatively large amount of money. On the other hand, this could mean that the individuals participating in the event were wealthy and could afford to bet on games or individuals participating in the game.\nMy query of billiards would result in about ten searches, sadly with only about four of which contained valuable information about the individuals at the sporting events. The results that I was able to query revealed that many individuals who participated were generals, corporals, or sergeants. This made me curious as to whether or not the army and navy had a larger participation rate than any other class of individuals. In order to query this thought I needed to query the words “sergeant” within three words of “billiard”. This came out with the same results that billiards came out with, but confirmed the thought that billiards participants were predominantly a part of the army and or navy.\nThe main limitation that I faced while attempting to query was running into such a small pool of results. This proposed that not as many people participated in billiards competitions in comparison to the other popular sports. However, it did not leave me with a large amount of information to analyze. Some of the query outputs that I had in result of my narrowed searches only led me to conclude that the billiard tournaments were typically held in club type of organizations and had some sort of monetary competition involved. The addition of a monetary element could lend a large role as to why the tournaments only involved men of higher positions in the army and or navy. With the higher positions of the men playing in the billiards tournaments could also impact what type of crowd that gathers to watch and likely bid on the men playing in the game. Typically, at the billiards events the men surrounding the wealthy or higher in position men participating in the tournament at hand were men who were in order to the men playing. These men were likely there in support of the men playing in the tournament. At this time having a support system during a particularly difficult billiards event could prove to win the tournament as a whole. Winning a tournament could also impact how individuals view you in the future and who the reigning champion would play in future billiards events.\nIn terms of the culture surround Alexandria around the years 1905-1907 there were many factors that played into simple aspects of life. Turnout at a tournament would impact who would play the game and how much would be bid on the game. In the world of billiards, there were never large amounts of people that would come out to the event, due to the exclusivity of a club and who they would let in.\n","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"13d9689868af1a7cee38cc5f7853a4ef","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hayes/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-hayes/","section":"post","summary":"This paper will examine the various types of individuals who go to and participate in billiards events.

The goal of this query is to return as many mentions of shipwrecks and ship collisions as possible. However, some manual filtering is required to get rid of irrelevant results. Once the irrelevant results are removed, there are about 36 different mentions of various shipwrecks that include a location and date. There may be a more concise or effective query than this, so if I come across it I will amend this document to reflect that query’s results instead.\nI made two bar graphs and one scatterplot. While I could just make a graph of the number of incidents over time based on the issue dates, most of the incidents are not reported on the day they occurred. Obviously, this is because it is nearly impossible to write and publish a newspaper article on something that happened that same day, especially if it happened far away. Because of this, I made a bar graph displaying the number of incidents that occurred in each month.\nNumber of Incidents vs. Month The x-axis on the graph separates the results into the twelve months of the year, and the y-axis displays the number of incidents. The shape of the bar graph is somewhat symmetrical and centered around the month of May. I suppose this could be due to more raw materials being exported and imported around the summer months, which would lead to more ships being in use, which would lead to more collisions.\nI also made a bar graph depicting the relationship between the number of incidents reported and the day of the week of the issue it was reported in.\nNumber of Reports vs Weekday of Issue The graph is very asymmetrical, with more incidents being reported on Mondays and a general decrease in reported incidents as the week goes by. The fact that more incidents are reported on Mondays than any other day of the week is, most likely, mainly due to the fact that the Egyptian Gazette did not publish issues on Sundays.\nThen, I made a scatterplot depicting the relationship between geographical distance between Cairo and the location of the incident and the time it took for the Egyptian Gazette to report on the incident. I used Google Maps to determine the approximate distance.\nDistance Between Cairo and the Incident vs. Time it Took to Report On this graph, the x-axis displays the distance (in miles) between Cairo and the incident. The y-axis displays the time it took to report on the incident (likely in days). My hope in making this graph was that there would be a visible pattern in the results that will allow me to infer something about the way these incidents are reported or how information spread at the time. If the correlation between distance and speed was strong and positive, it would mean that the methods of communication used were not very efficient. If there is little or no correlation, then the information spread fast enough for distance to not affect the effectiveness of communication.\nAfter plotting the points on a coordinate plane and calculating a line of best fit and its coefficient of determination (which turned out to be R2= 0.079), it became clear that there was no correlation between the physical distance between Cairo and the incident and the time it took to report on said incident. This indicates that the spread of information throughout the world was fast enough at the time that an incident happening far away did not determine how long it would take for that information to spread. Therefore, communication during this time period was very effective.\nHere is a post tracking Russian and Japanese ships during the year of 1905.\nHere is a post analyzing how telegrams worked as a means of rapid communication during the time period.\n","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"24155bdcdd8c986d9de0f79167fad975","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-kamata/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-kamata/","section":"post","summary":"//p[matches(., 'sank', 'i') and matches(., 'ship', 'i')]|//p[matches(., 'collision', 'i') and matches(., 'ship', 'i')]|//p[matches(., 'sank', 'i') and matches(., 'collision', 'i')]|//p[matches(., 'collide', 'i') and matches(., 'ship', 'i')]|//p[matches(., 'sank', 'i') and matches(., 'collide', 'i')]|//p[matches(.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Location and Speed to Analyze the Effectiveness of Communication","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peyton Smith"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Introduction For my subtopic, I’ve decided to analyze wind speeds in relation to my group’s general topic, the heat of the sun. More specifically, I wanted to pick apart data, like from the heat of the sun analysis, and get information that can be used to research upon relating to what I’ve analyzed for the heat of the sun. I thought this was a good subtopic in that, maybe the two data sets (wind speeds and the heat of the sun) will conform with one another, or maybe the data is inversely proportional to one in other. With this, it can also question the validity in acquiring this data, through XPath queries. For this, I thought that it would be neat to find a proper credible source that analyzes wind speeds for Alexandria in some arbitrary year, and see if the data trends are the somewhat the same as shown in mine.\nXPath Query For my XPath Query, like my general topic, I needed something that yielded results that will tangentially represent what we’ve researched in our heat of the sun analysis. XPath Query: //table//cell[matches(.,\u0026#39;force of anemometer\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number(). This query allowed the search engine to find a table and a cell within the table that has the phrase ‘force of anemometer’ without case sensitivity and from that pick apart the measure from the Anemometer force cell and yield only the numerical value. The results yielded 215 items, however, I only needed to use the results in my [May 1905-April 1906] timeframe.\nData Visualization Now that I’ve got my results in the allotted time frame, I put the measures with their respective dates in a spreadsheet and converted the data into a visualization through Tableau. Since we are dealing with many different measures I wanted to take the averages of them rather than listing out all the measures in a graph where the visualization would be a bit messy, so I did averages by month.\nLine Graph of Averages per month for the Force of Anemometer Since the XPath query and data for both my subtopic and general topic had the same structure, I wanted to make a contrast in the visualization itself, so I made it a line graph, and I thought it looked nicer and more concise than a bar graph. I believe that even though we are dealing with averages, the visualization is enough to provide a bit of context to what the data may entail and does so without making it look too confusing and messy with data points strewed everywhere.\nWhat does the visualization show? In the data visualization, you can notice that an overall trend is shown as the months go by. At the start of the graph, it begins at a high in the Spring months, then decreases down into the colder months then goes back up as Spring season happens again in the following year. From this, we can pick apart some significant meaning as the data somewhat matches up with the data shown in the heat of the sun research.\nContext Once my data brought about some potential significant meaning, I wanted to research why wind speeds vary throughout the year. On a science forum, it discusses the science behind why wind speeds are higher in the winter.\nThere is much greater variation in barometric pressure during the winter than during the summer. On average, high pressure systems are higher pressure and low pressure systems are lower pressure. This leads to a more rapid flow of air between the systems. This fluctuation is caused by much greater variation in temperature during the winter. While most summer days are roughly the same temperature, winter temperatures fluctuate dramatically.\nThe science here shows that winter will always have higher wind speeds due to the temperature differences in the season, whereas in the summer there isn’t much difference as the temperatures stay hot. Although this source provides a strong foundation on why wind speeds vary throughout the year, I needed to dig deeper. More specifically, I wanted to find a source that showed me the wind speeds in Alexandria itself from a more credible source than what I worked with.\nBar Graph of the Average Wind Speeds by month in Alexandria The data visualization shown here provides a good reference to what my visualization should represent, as it is a credible source where the data comes from several stations all across Alexandria. From this, it shows that on average the speeds in the colder months are higher than the hotter months, with a big spike in July.\nConclusion So what does my research say about the heat of the sun in relation to wind speeds? Ultimately, not much. In my data, there were some inconsistencies that thrown the visualization off. My data visualization didn’t exactly conform to the science behind wind speeds and the bar graph shown above didn’t really match up with my visualization. For example, in my data, there were only 2 data points for November and 6 data points for December to work with and both were relatively low which messed with the averages tremendously as these months, being winter months, are supposed to …","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"8c7711767fb7c5f9016e0a364450531a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-smith/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-smith/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction For my subtopic, I’ve decided to analyze wind speeds in relation to my group’s general topic, the heat of the sun.

However, these focus merely on the accident itself rather than the way it impacted the people involved. For this reason, I wanted to investigate the reactions to different accidents, the extent to which fear is reported in the “Egyptian Gazette”.\nI started my research by using the XPath query //head[matches(.,‘accident’, ‘i’)]. This resulted in 147 articles with the word ‘accident’ in the headline. Rather than read all of these articles I narrowed the search. This was done by using the XPath query //p[matches(.,‘fear’, ‘i’) and matches(.,‘accident’, ‘i’)]. This provided me with articles that contained the words fear and accident. Not all of these articles referred to fear within people, so I did not utilize those. To collect further evidence, I replaced the word fear in the XPath query with words such as anxious, terror and shock. To show the various reactions to the accidents I produced a word cloud. The word cloud shows the contrast of the various words used after the accidents, the bigger the word, the more frequently it was found in the paper. However, I wanted to go further into how emotions are used throughout the paper.\nEmotions are seen throughout the “Egyptian Gazette” in instances without ‘accidents’. I wanted to explore the extent to which emotions are portrayed in relation to accidents or without accidents. For the purpose of this examination I am defining the word accident as an unfortunate accident, typically resulting in damage or an injury. I used various XPath queries to find this information. I used the query //p[matches(.,‘fear’, ‘i’) and matches(.,‘accident’, ‘i’)] to find the emotions in relation to accidents. I took off the matches ‘accident’ part of the query to find the emotions in the paper as a whole. I searched the complete working to set in order to accumulate the most accurate data possible. Once I collected the data, I made a visualization showing the difference in the amount of times a word was used in relation to an accident as compared to without an accident. I made a data table in excel and then used tableau to produce a line graph.\nOne of the articles I came across in my initial search for paragraphs containing fear and accident had a blog post written about it. The Chatham Explosion, had a three column story written about in the September 29th 1905 issue. There was a blog post written about it. In the article it is said that the people were “fearing accidents” and “anxious”. In the blog post written about this accident, it is shown that people were anxious about the explosion but it was not as extreme as anticipated. This could be why they were not using emotion words such as dread but rather anxious, as it was not a very extreme disaster.\nAfter reading some of the articles about the various accidents, that included an emotion or reaction I found that many people felt fearful especially after a “nearly fatal” accident. Fear is a natural response to almost dying so this makes sense. However, I was really questioning why they were merely fearful, could a stronger emotion have been used? To learn more about the history of emotions in this time period and in Egypt I went searching for outside sources. I was shown a study that examined and compared varying emotions. In a way they were rating or ranking different emotions. Using the HEEM (Historical Embodied Emotions Model) this study classified emotions. They had 37 classes of emotions, one class being fear. This study compared negative and positive emotion words and looked at their frequencies. Throughout the “Egyptian Gazette”, I was looking at emotions that would all be considered negative.\nI also found a book specifically about the history of emotions in Cairo. Emotional Cities: Debates on Urban Change in Berlin and Cairo, 1860-1910, was written by Joseph Ben Prestel, about the history of emotions in this time period. While I could not manage to get a full copy of the book I was able to find a pdf summary and use this information to better my own analysis. In this work he focused on emotions as a physical concept rather than something moral or spiritual. Prestel utilized urban planning and culture to examine emotions and their extremity. While this is an intriguing way to analyze the emotions at the time, it is not necessarily the same thing I am analyzing.\nIn conclusion, emotions are a very complex topic to analyze in a newspaper. By analyzing emotions many questions arise as to why they were feeling these emotions and how extreme they really are. By looking at emotion words in relation to accidents and without accidents I was able to evaluate the extent to which emotions were seen throughout the newspaper as a whole.\n","date":1575590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575590400,"objectID":"2cf5faf5380a810cf7e8bdc85cfa16ed","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-crisafulli/","publishdate":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-crisafulli/","section":"post","summary":"The “Egyptian Gazette” has many stories about various types of accidents that happened all over the world, but mostly in Egypt.

This group analysis project investigates accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette at the turn of the 20th century through several different lenses. These lenses can be broken into three main categories: 1) Investigating particular types of accidents: fires, ships and railways; 2) Investigating the language around accidents: linguistic descriptors and emotions portrayed; and 3) Investigating the locations of reported accidents. These three categories come together to create a broad encompassing analysis of accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907.\nFire-related accidents is one of the chosen subtopics of this project. Data about this topic was made into a visualization and compared side-to-side with one another to easily discern patterns in the data such as what times of the year fire accidents were frequently reported. These patterns were then analyzed to estimate what could have caused these increased frequencies of fire accident reports. The ability of the fire brigade to fight these fires was also examined and what effect this what effect this ability or inability would have had on the peace of mind of people in Alexandria at the time. In my analysis I found that there was an increased number of fires during the summer and winter seasons. This pattern could be the result of a number of factors, but I think a sensible conclusion would be that the warm summer temperatures directly caused more fires and the cold temperatures and less daylight of winter caused people to light fireplaces and candles more often, thus indirectly causing more fires. This subtopic directly relates to the overall topic, the social history of accidents in Alexandria, because it involves the gathering of data about a specific type of accident and attempts to look at the subtopic from the point of view of someone living in Alexandria at the time.\nThere are quite a few ship accidents that happen, considering the fact that Egypt exports and imports many goods. Most of these accidents are collisions involving one ship sinking, but there are several that involve two or more ships. Regardless, this type of accident is usually worth reporting to the general public. However, the Egyptian Gazette does not always immediately report on these incidents. A lot of the reports reach the Gazette through telegrams, but often times it takes more than just several days to form and publish an article. I made a scatterplot depicting the relationship between geographical distance between Cairo and the location of the incident and the time it took for the Egyptian Gazette to report on the incident. My hope in making this graph was that there would be a visible pattern in the results that will allow me to infer something about the way these incidents are reported or how information spread at the time. If the correlation between distance and speed was strong and positive, it would mean that the methods of communication used were not very efficient. If there was little or no correlation, then the information spread fast enough for distance to not affect the effectiveness of communication. The correlation for the line of best fit for this scatterplot was very weak, with the R2 value being 0.079. Because of this, I concluded that the time it takes to publish an article is not correlated with the physical distance between Cairo and the incident. This lack of correlation relates to social history because it could be a good representation of how information spread in the early 20th century. Obviously, the spread of information was much slower in that time period compared to now, but the technology had advanced enough for the spread of information to be unaffected by distance.\nThroughout the Egyptian Gazette, there are many instances of reported railway accidents. To analyze this type of accident, I formed a data set of 32 rail-related accidents reported in the newspaper from 1905-1907. Using this data, I investigated the geographical locations, the types of accidents, and the monthly prevalence of these railway accidents. To analyze the geographical locations, I mapped all the reported rail accidents. This revealed that the overwhelming majority, 26 out of 32, of the reported accidents occurred in Egypt. Internationally reported events often involved royalty, or someone else of wealth, or was a dramatically tragic event, such as the death of dozens or of a child. Within my data set, I found four main types of accidents reported on: those caused by a crash, derailment, unfastened door, or, the most prevalent of those reported, someone being run over. Monthly prevalence of these events did not follow any apparent trend, either proof of an incomplete data set or a lack of correlation between the time of the year and prevalence of accidents.

The seemingly prevalent issue caught my attention and initiated my analysis on railway accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907. This analysis attempts to add to the knowledge and research on this topic by looking at the geographical locations of rail accidents reported, the types of rail accidents reported on, and when during the year these accidents occurred. I will then use my findings and the research of others to contextualize these rail accidents, looking at how railway development and their workers have been reported on in the Egyptian Gazette, and the, perhaps, limited scope that this provides.\nResearch Methods Before my analysis, I will briefly explain some of my research methods. To compile the data set used for this analysis, I used the XPath query: //div//head[matches(.,\u0026#39;accident\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p[matches(.,\u0026#39;train\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] to search for all articles with a headline containing the word “accident” and a paragraph containing the word “train.” This search gave me 47 results. To create as complete a data set as possible, I tried several variation of this search, which resulted in seven more articles. After excluding irrelevant articles, I ultimately resulted in a data set of 32 railway accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907. This data served as the core for my analysis.\nGeographical Locations In looking at the locations of railway accidents reported on, the overwhelming majority, 26 out of 32, occurred within Egypt, with 11 being reported under the “Local and General” feature. This suggests that the people reading the Egyptian Gazette cared more about that which pertained to them and their locale than they cared about events unrelated to themselves, when it came to railway accidents. However, international accidents were reported on too. Specifically, six of the 32 reported on occurred outside of Egypt (Sudan, Syria, Israel, France, England x2 ). These international events often involved royalty, or someone else of wealth, or was a tragic event, such as the death of dozens of people or a child. Other than England and France, the other countries reported on were in close proximity to Egypt. The inclusion of these two European countries demonstrates the newspaper’s audience’s connection to colonial Britain. I have mapped all the reported railway accidents to the best of my ability. This involved updating some city names to their modern spellings and marking all accidents found in “Local and General” as occurring in Alexandria. These approximations seem accurate as one can nearly trace a line between the locations in and around the Nile Delta, many of which follow along water ways or in clear paths, indicating that a rail line may have existed there.\nTypes of Accidents There were four main types of accidents reported on. Those caused by a crash, derailment, unfastened door, or, the most prevalent of those reported, someone being run over. In the bar graph below, one can see the number of times each type of accident was reported on over the three years, broken down by the outcome of that accident: No Injuries, Injury, or Death. Cases where there were both injuries and deaths were counted as a “Death.” This breakdown shows that most of the accidents reported on resulted in an injury or worse. Most of the “No Injuries” were crashes or derailments of goods trains. Also frequently mentioned, was the delay that the accident caused, such as on September 15, 1905 when a train derailed, resulting in “an hour and twenty minutes late in arrival in Alexandria.” This further demonstrates the idea that what is considered newsworthy is that with dramatic outcomes or an impact to one’s daily life.\nMonthly Prevalence I also investigated when these accidents occurred and their prevalence in the newspaper at that time. To prevent results skewed by one year simply having more or less issues, I graphed the number of accidents reported divided by the total number of issues for that month to find the fraction of issues that contain a reference to a railway accident. This resulted in the following graph that shows spikes and falls, but does not reveal a common trend. Perhaps if all the months contained fuller daily data, a clearer trend would appear.\nContextualization and Final Analysis When I started my research I was expecting an overwhelming disapproval or blame of railway workers for these accidents. This assumption came from my early findings on workers being reported as “careless” and from Ziad Fahmy’s published journal entry in which he states that, “The general feeling of disenfranchisement, … were subtly blamed on British wartime rationing and foreign-owned capital,” such as the railways. However, this was not clearly confirmed nor denied.\nThere were many instances of railway workers’ deaths being mentioned briefly and without much regard, which may indicate a lack of empathy or care for this …","date":1575504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575504000,"objectID":"cb76dc89b459c931c56a488f8595c2a7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-grant/","publishdate":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-grant/","section":"post","summary":"In the Egyptian Gazette, I came across many instances of rail-related accidents.

I also tried to uncover how proficient the fire brigade was at the time and determine if the losses from these fires were partly a result of inadequate preparedness. To accomplish these tasks, I first searched the Egyptian Gazette repository using the XPath query //p[contains(., “fire”) and contains(., “accident”) or contains(., “fire brigade”)]. I originally searched divs instead of paragraphs, but this search yielded many irrelevant results pertaining to fire insurance and other advertisements. Searching paragraphs seemed to give much more relevant results. This yielded 58 results which was filtered to 53 results after removing articles on subsequent days referring to the same incident. I saved these 53 results and removed any information unnecessary to data visualization, leaving only the year, month, and day of the incident. This data was then visualized in bar graphs below representing fires reported by year and month.\nIn examining the first graph, the amount of reported fire accidents seems to be fairly steady across the three years. However, upon examination of the second graph, there seems to be a spike in reported fires in the month of June. This could have been the result of multiple factors, but the city of Alexandria would’ve been in the midst of summer during this month and the high temperatures associated with the season seems to be the most probable cause of the spike. There also seems to be a relative spike of reported fire accidents in the months of winter, which is likely the result of people lighting their fireplaces at night to avoid cold temperatures and from people lighting their lamps and candles more often due to less daily sunlight. These visualizations obviously don’t provide any indication of the proficiency of the fire brigade at this time, but it does accomplish my first goal of finding patterns in the data visualizations.\nIn order to determine the reported proficiency of the fire brigade in Alexandria at the time, I searched the repository with a much simpler XPath query: //p[contains(., “fire brigade”)].\nAfter reading the context of each result, I noticed that most results had either good or neutral remarks about the fire brigade’s proficiency. In fact, there was an entire article praising the fire brigade’s competency. Among the negative remarks was an article explaining in detail how the fire brigade (and police department) was completely unprepared to put out a fire. According to the article, the fire brigade was immediately notified of the emergency but did not show up until 2 hours after the alarm. A few policemen were present at the fire after coincidentally strolling past it but did absolutely nothing about it until 30 minutes after it had started. In fact, they made the situation worse by instructing men from the power company, who started fighting the fire 5 minutes after it had started, to leave the scene. Among the query results were some unexpected articles explaining how the city of Alexandria itself was ill-equipped to combat fires at the time. I read a few articles explaining how there weren’t enough fire hydrants in the city, which meant the fire brigade had to attach their hoses to the hydrants from long distances before they could start fighting the fire. There were also articles stating that the roads were blocked by trees, rocks, and other debris that the fire engines couldn’t pass through. At the time, the city of Alexandria was in the process of constructing granite roads in place of their previous dirt ones. The road closures associated with this construction could have inhibited the movement of the fire engines, but an article by the Mediterranean Historical Review presents another road issue. According to the article, Scraping the surface: the techno-politics of modern streets in turn-of-twentieth-century Alexandria, “In wintertime the city’s dirt roads would become so muddy that pedestrians and beasts of burden had trouble advancing, and wheeled vehicles could hardly move at all.” This would have greatly inhibited the fire brigade’s ability to do their job and would have been made worse as the winters seemed to experience a greater frequency of fires as explained above.\nAfter examining the data collected, I concluded that the fire brigade demonstrated great performance in most reported circumstances. There were some articles explaining where they fell short, but that can be said of any governmental organization. The major problem at the time seemed to be inadequacy of roads and equipment rather than the fire brigade itself. From the perspective of civilians living in Alexandria at the time, the fact that their fire brigade was skillful at what they did must have been led to a peace of mind, reassuring that a fire would be swiftly dealt with whenever one arose.\nAnalysis on this topic could be improved …","date":1575417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575417600,"objectID":"1127f9ad6a7a85490f7e0dad3ced3a07","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-walter/","publishdate":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-walter/","section":"post","summary":"The purpose of my project is to analyze fire accidents reported by the Egyptian Gazette and find patterns in the months and years that they occurred in.

Today, it is estimated that there are 1.3 to 4 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths worldwide due to cholera, in mostly socially undeveloped areas (Cholera). In The Egyptian Gazette, there are 171 references to the disease ranging from a variety of topics. Some, if not most of our sample of the Gazette refers to where the disease is spotted in the world and if it threatens Alexandria, Egypt. Other mentions describe how modern medicine understands the disease and advertisements for medication claiming to remedy cholera amongst other ailments.\nEarlier on in our sample of The Egyptian Gazette, there is a spike in the mentions of the disease cholera, mostly in the months of August through October 1905. All of these mentions in this timeframe describe how cholera is ravaging throughout Europe. Several articles detail its spread geographically throughout northeastern Europe. For example, in a September, 19th 1905 edition of the newspaper, an article titled “The Cholera Scare” describes a “recent outbreak of cholera in Russia and Germany [that] has caused quite a scare throughout Europe, and it [had] behov[ed] the Sanitary Department to take prompt measures to prevent the dread malady appearing in Egypt…”. The article later goes on to describe how past epidemics have plagued Egypt, describing the other instances with death tolls in the several tens of thousands. The article further states that “It is worthy of note that the disease in this country has invariably broken out in the hot months, and disappeared with the advent of cold weather, so that it is reasonable to assume that we shall be spared any visitation [of cholera] this year.” This prediction proves to be true because there are no mentions of cholera infecting anybody in Egypt within this timeframe, in fact there are articles refuting any rumors that cholera has been spotted in Egypt in this time period.\nFrom November 1905 to December 1907, there are very few mentions of cholera, most mentions in this timeframe are from either advertisements, or articles describing what is known about cholera and disease in general. An article from January 26th, 1908 titled “Mosquitoes in Egypt” tells of the need for education for better sanitary practices for the prevention of diseases from coming into Egypt. Another article called “Egypt’s Curse” from a September 11th issue of the Gazette details the new science of “bacteriology” and what is known about how bacteria work and how they might have survived in a suspended state of animation from the preservation of mummies. The bacterial resistance of cholera is discussed saying that the bacteria vary in how resistant they are. Some bacteria seem to perish after only a few hours and some lasted up to eight months with the various experiments that scientists have conducted on them.\nOnly one advertisement claims to remedy cholera, diarrhea, colic, and dysentery, and that product is Dr. J. Collis Brown’s Chlorodyne. Surprisingly enough, the product is only advertised fourteen times over the three years or so of the newspaper that has been encoded. Further research into Chlorodyne revealed that the medication was an effective treatment for these diseases as well as other ailments not listed in the advertisements. The reasoning behind its effectiveness were the active ingredients being opiates and marijuana (McCabe, 1979) . Interestingly enough this advertisement that claims to remedy cholers do not seem to have any correlation to when cholera was mentioned more frequently in the newspaper, even as fears of cholera began to spread within Egypt.\nBeginning in the last month of 1907, cholera outbreaks began to pop up in places close to and in Egypt, namely one case in Suez, Egypt and 34 deaths in the port-town of Sinope, Turkey. After the new year rolled around, a plethora of cases began to pop up in Mecca and Djeddah, Saudi Arabia. Almost every day, new reports coming in from those areas tell of plague and death. These areas are very close to Alexandria and in response, the Sanitary Department of Alexandria has issued a warning of an impending outbreak in the area. This is particularly interesting because the precautions that the newspaper reports on seem very obvious to someone in today’s time, but may have been completely foreign to readers at this time. Some of the actions the Sanitary Department advises are to:\nWash hands after using the restroom and before eating. Eat only well-cooked food and avoid unfiltered water, uncooked milk and butter, and fruits and vegetables that cannot be cooked or peeled. Avoid an excess of food, and cold beverages. Seek medical attention with the slighted suspicion. Do not allow servants to go out without changing clothes and washing hands and don’t allow them to bring anyone back with them.

Sanatorium movement labeled tuberculosis as a disease caused by one’s way of life and could be prevented and treated by fresh air, exercise, and good nutrition in a sanatorium. Sanatoriums were hospitals for long term illnesses like TB before the invention of antibiotics. Very common it was treated by rest in bed in hospital through the second half of 19th century.\nPeruna ads do not contain tuberculosis though it is clearly an issue and had major news coverage. Little to none was known about illnesses like tuberculosis leaving medical professionals scratching their heads. Perhaps trials were done but were deemed unsuccessful, and therefore, not published in the Egyptian Gazette.\nEven though there were no new drugs on the market for tuberculosis, action was being taken in other avenues. A village in Italy named Salsomaggiore became famous for its waters rich in various nutrients such as bromine, iodine, and lithium that were used to treat rheumatism, tuberculosis, and ladies’ complaints. The Anti-Tuberculosis League worked to educate the public when news headlines disclosed that tuberculosis was a concern in Egypt. This group blamed the outbreak of the disease on the ignorance of natives and part of the European population to hygiene.\nIn a telegram I found a heading referring to “Bovine tuberculosis” and that it had been discovered to be communicable through raw milk in 1907 which left me to infer that at this time Egypt and Europe had not yet created any pasteurization laws or pasteurized milk was difficult to obtain for certain populations. However, I recalled an ad entitled “Howie’s Sterilized Milk or Cream” which was targeted to those traveling to Europe as well as young children. This ad starting to appear in the Gazette even in the year 1905, before it was circulated in telegrams in sent in 1907. Perhaps no laws yet required the pasteurization of milk and only those that could afford sterilized milk bought it and the rest were left more susceptible to tuberculosis.\nI used the query //div[(@type=“advert”) or (@type=“advertisement”)]/p originally to see if there were any advertisements that contained either TB or Tuberculosis, and I came up with only one ad in the local and general section that was not really supposed to be tagged as an ad. After that, I was curious as to how many times just the word “tuberculosis” appeared with no restriction and got 78 results. I then decided that since there were so little results, that I would just go through these one at a time to see what information I could gather most of which I touched on above. Furthermore, I created a visualization comparing the frequency of tuberculosis per month and per year.\nIn the years 1905-1907 September, October, and May had the most mentions of tuberculosis. This may be correlated to weather conditions or an overall decrease in cases due to the establishment of more hospitals and sanatoriums. In October of 1905 a Professor by the name of Behring claimed of a new remedy, but this new remedy was never officially disclosed. This new remedy could have possibly been revealed as insufficient and was therefore not retouched in the Gazette.\nWith many ads like Dr. William’s Pink Pills for Pale People, which claimed to be the cure all by purifying the blood or even making new blood, since at the time bad blood was thought to be a trigger for disease, you would think tuberculosis would be included in their long list of curable diseases. I personally do not know a lot about tuberculosis and its status in the medical world today, so I decided to do a little more digging to see how medical breakthroughs have altered the occurrence and elimination of the disease currently and how this is compares to Egypt in the early 1900s. What I found from an article by the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institute of Health was that to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is still a worldwide epidemic. In 2010 WHO declared that about 1/3 of the world’s population was infected by TB, which is not very far from 2019. Doctors even face issues with drug-resistant strainsof the disease which lead to further modifications of treatment. Of course, we have witnessed ground-breaking discoveries in treating and preventing the spread of TB by the development of vaccines as well as antibiotics since the 1900s but there is still a lot of guesswork done in the treatment and management of tuberculosis, a lot similar to the nature of medical intervention mentioned in Egypt and Europe between the years 1904 and 1907.\n","date":1575417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575417600,"objectID":"c836ab6c51b7abfbe5cc09be70d4ed75","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-heflin/","publishdate":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-heflin/","section":"post","summary":"Tuberculosis was a popular disease plaguing Egypt and Europe, however, science was limited and was still developing new methods of treatment a lot like TB in the medical field today.","tags":["tuberculosis","medicine"],"title":"Tuberculosis and Medicine","type":"post"},{"authors":["Phuong Nguyen"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"One aspect that can be used to describe accidents is the linguistic descriptions of the accidents within the Egyptian Gazette. The most descriptive terms come prior to the word “accident,” so the best start to using XML and querying was to search for “accident” and restrict it to headers with “head.” This resulted in 145 items. This was then copied and pasted into atom. Atom was used to cut the extra text down to the words in between the and in the Description lines by searching the buffer for the System ID: line, Match:, Start line, and Length line and replacing them all with empty space. The only lines saved were those containing “accident” or “accidents.” I did not take into consideration the possibility of “accident” being misspelled in a way that Atom couldn’t recognize. Articles like 14 “the”s were replaced. 12 “a”s were erased by using \\sa\\s (blank space, a, blank space) so as not to replace a’s within words. They were replaced with empty space. All periods were erased by turning off regex and were replaced with empty space. I found XML language stuck in the buffer somehow (Match:) by using \u0026lt;\\w+. I was unsure of how to do a full erasure from \u0026lt; to \u0026gt; and end header, but there were only three lines, so I simply erased them. One was “Description.” All were replaced with empty space. I then used Atom to find \\r\\n\\r\\n to replace the long empty spaces with \\n.\nOne problem I approached were the spaces in front of lines that I had caused from replacing A’s with a space. I didn’t know of a way to fix this automatically without redoing all of the previous work, so I replaced them by hand with \\s. Double spaces were replaced with one space too.\nAfter saving this file, I opened a new file and copied over same saved data. I deleted all “to”s with /sto/s and all the “at”s with \\sat\\s.\nI erased all the “accident” and “accidents” because I only wanted the descriptions in the visual representation since the subject was the descriptions rather than the word accident itself. I deleted leftover spaces individually.\nAfter inserting the list into wordcloud.com, I encountered another problem: the same words showed up more than once if they were fully capitalized or fully in lowercase or even had only the first letter capitalized. I then used the shortcut using the Shift key and F3 which put the entire list in all caps.\nAnother problem was encountered: some ”common words” are actually connected to the primary words, which is fine to just look and add back to.\nAnother problem: some of these words have the same meaning, i.e. drowning and bathing, motor and car, car and tramway probably refer to the same things.\nThe data was put into an excel spreadsheet and connected that to tableau by.\nI deleted the “ on “implacable inside tableau to keep ABC order.\naccident\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\\w?\nUsing this long stretch of text, I erased words that included the word “accident” such as the word itself and “accidents”, “accidentally”, etc. (under “accident p”, xml was for paragraphs (and heads) containing the word “accident.”\n“…” was erased. One trouble I don’t know how to solve was capturing the whole paragraph instead of just parts of it. I think this should suffice as the best option, since trying to capture the entire paragraphs in other ways lead to only obtaining lines that didn’t have the word “accident” at all. .

Since paragraphs contained higher counts of words like “train” and “railway”, but headlines contained higher counts of “fatal”, “railway”, “motor”, and “tram”, one can see that the word “fatal” is a signal for readers that there is an important accident. This also shows that there is a high probability that most reoccurring accidents are firstly train accidents and secondly motor accidents.\nHaving the top four words in common be “cairo”, “injured”, “railway”, and “train” show again that train accidents occur the most and are presented most frequently, as well as having a strong basis in Cairo. “Injured” is a common word used for both show and description- a signal for readers that a person was affected but also a common description for readers to catch onto.\nAccording to “Reported Accidents, Incidents, Tragedies, and Disasters”, accidents can be …","date":1575331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575331200,"objectID":"d036e75231047fc97036c78255f3896f","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-nguyen/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-nguyen/","section":"post","summary":"One aspect that can be used to describe accidents is the linguistic descriptions of the accidents within the Egyptian Gazette.

Expanding on our group project, which was referring to the highest and lowest producing stocks in the stock market in 1906; I wanted to look further into this and see how well you could do with Bank stocks as I noticed throughout the months, while finishing my deliverables, that the banks were heavily advertised and very involved within Egypt’s economy. I looked through the “Stocks and Shares” table in quarter one of 1906 to get the most accurate results. This table not only showed the stock prices but the debentures and well. A stock is basically the digital equivalent of owning a part of a company for which they are able to buy and sell as they wish. A debenture is essentially the same thing but more similar to a bond in that it is everything that a bond is but also secured by assets.\nThe point of this project was basically to show how one would do by investing in the financial sector in the time of rebuilding as Egypt was still going through an economic overhaul led by the British. After the war of 1882 with the British, Egypt was taken over and made as a project by the British to rebuild the declining economy starting with their very important cotton industry. Another reason I decided to ask this question is because while Egypts economy was beginning to suffer and their recession in 1907 was becoming apparent, I wanted to see how a financial stock would fare against negative investor sentiment. The recession trend was also very similar to the US financial crisis of 2008. There is a parallel as the crisis bled into everyday life and affected almost everyone apart of the economy. Both Egypt and the US economy suffered greatly from the recessions and bled more and more everyday. The one key difference was that while the financial sector, specifically the bank stocks were hit the hardest in the US crisis; in Egypt there was really no sector at fault. To go ahead and find out the answer to my question, I decided to do a little research on each of the stocks in the financial sector at the time and figure out which made the most sense.\nI chose the National Bank of Egypt because it is the biggest and oldest bank in Egypt and would give me the best results in terms of the financial sector as it is a solid indicator for the sector as a whole. Stemming from my project, the query: //div[@xml:id=“deg-el-stsh01”]/table//cell[contains(.,‘National Bank of Egypt.’)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure\nWould allow me to see the changes in the prices of the bank shares and the growth or decline of the share as each week went by. This allowed me to also see the visualization as a graph and a trendline.\nThe stock is clearly a growth stock and an indicator of a winner as it has a positive trend. From this visualization, it is obvious, in a small sample size, that the stock is a survivor during a bear market and a great recession-resistant stock. For historical context, The National Bank of Egypt, in 1906, established in Addis Ababa, the Bank of Abyssinia. This bank was able to be granted a 50 year monopoly and became the Ethiopian government fiscal agent as well as the only issuer of currency. It was the most respected commercial bank in Egypt because it was never separated from the national concerns or issues. It has also been the main supporter of Egypts very important national economy by helping finance its major projects. This backed with the fact that it moved the majority of Egypts banking assets, deposits, loans, and advances at the time, it was a safe bet during the recession. So how would I do if I decided to jump the gun and invested in the biggest and oldest bank in Egypt? Not only would I do well, I would be beating the market average by a mile and then some.\nAs an expansion to my reasoning for this project, I wanted to credit a second source that was actually suggested to me by Mr. Hanley himself. I remembered Professor Hanley mentioning during our Blog Post project that we should try and find other blog posts similar to ours and during my search, I found a source that I kept just in case for my analysis project because I knew I was going to do something on the stock market.

Germination of a cotton seed and the subsequent sprouting and ripening of that seed cannot be affected by the air’s relative humidity. The only thing that could possibly be affected by humidity if the quality of the cotton. For example, if the cotton was soaked through due to the humidity and therefore lost some of its inherent integrity as a fiber. However, humidity does in fact inform the analyst of one thing and that is whether there was rainfall and how frequently that rainfall was taking place. According to Smart Fog “When it rains, it will increase the relative humidity because of the evaporation. The air where the rain is falling may not be completely saturated with water vapor. However, the longer it rains, the more the humidity will increase because of the air constantly drawing the water.” Using this knowledge inferences can be made about rainfall as humidity increases across a certain time period and in turn see rainfalls effect on cotton yields. This roundabout, estimative way of seeing how rainfall affects cotton yields is necessary due to the fact that there is minimal rainfall data throughout the Egyptian Gazette so far as people have either not entered it in or left the template as it was. However, using this method there can at least be some inference about rainfall and its amounts and effect on cotton yield using secondary sources to add where the estimate lacks.\nAccording to data gathered through Xpath queries executed on the Egyptian Gazette content repository which queried the tables that contained figures for cotton exports and recorded the sums found in each issue pairing them to the dates that they were found, Cotton yields were the highest in January. So high in fact that the amounts recorded outstrip the second highest value by more than twice that values amount. This implies that humidity and in turn rainfall was at optimal levels which according to Organic cotton is about 500mm of water between germination and boll formation. Yields then begin to fall to their lowest recorded in March but then rise to more than triple that amount by May. They then fall to almost half of May’s yields by July but almost rises back to May’s amounts in just one month in August but then fall by even lower than half in just one month to September. The least drastic difference occurs between September and October where compared to the other months it’s just a small rise in cotton yields.\nData gathered through the same method used to find data on cotton yields on humidity yielded much less exciting results as the average humidity throughout the months looks much different than the cotton yields. However, data can still be extracted from the results gathered. The graph shows a relative decrease in the average humidity from January to July and a relative increase from July to October. The humidity then begins on a decrease again from November to December which can be inferenced to be part of the relative decrease from January to July.\nAccording to trading economics , which is an online platform that provides historical data, economic forecasts, news, and trading recommendations across 196 countries, the relative increase and decrease of precipitation in Egypt in 1907 corresponds with the relative increases and decreases in humidity as shown in the humidity percentage graph. This supports the theory that by measuring the humidity fluctuations over each month it can be estimated whether it is raining more or less in a specific time period. Through both the graph of rainfall and the graph of humidity it can be inferred that relative rainfall was decreasing from January to July and increasing from July to October. Comparing this with the cotton exports graph shows very little correlation between cotton exports and humidity. The turning points of the cotton exports graph and the relative decreases and increases found in the humidity and rainfall graphs do not line up very well in the slightest. This suggests that either humidity and rainfall in Egypt don’t affect cotton growth very much or the way that the data itself is flawed in some way. This could be further investigated by making sure every humidity and cotton export value in every table analyzed is correct when compared to the page images the date is supposed to be taken from and/or doing the same for rainfall and correcting every rainfall value to see If rainfall may be different than what was found on trading economics.\n","date":1575331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575331200,"objectID":"78b5c0123ac12d1529d0c56c7dbc996d","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-thomas/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-thomas/","section":"post","summary":"Humidity in and of itself does not have a strong correlation to cotton yields due to the fact that humidity by itself does not affect cotton.

This analysis was created with the purpose of finding out whether or not global warming has been occuring specifically in Alexandria, Egypt by taking data found from May 1906 to April 1907 and comparing it to an article I found that lists the temperature change in Alexandria Egypt over the last 100 years to see if there has been an increase in the average temeperature and if so what could be the leading factors in the climate change.\nXPath Query The Xpath Queries I have chosen to use are: 1.Max Temps: //table//cell[contains(.,‘Max. Temp in the shade’)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()\n2.Min Temps: //table//cell[contains(.,‘Min. Temp in the shade’)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()\nThe goal of the query is to find a certain table in the newspaper which shows the weather information which typically is found on page 2-3 and from that, I would take the data that is under the maximum and minimum temperature section. By taking the following sibling cell after the cell that says max temperature and minimum temperature, I will be able to gather the numbers provided and copy and paste them into Atom to then use them to create useful visualizations. The Xpath query had to be narrowed down to keywords such as the exact titles of the weather report or else the information could be skewed. Another important thing in making the query was making sure that the results that were given back were in numbers so it would not mess up the graph if someone would have written something in that section.\nData Visualization Since the data I have gathered was far too large to display one by one on the bar graph, I had to split it up into months and show the average temperature of each month. While looking through the data individually, I found that there were very few giant errors in the numbers provided which made the graphs look a lot smoother than if otherwise it had a giant spike out of nowhere. From the graphs we can interpret that the temperature reaches its peak in July and goes through a steady decline until february and after february it starts to increase back up and keeps following this cycle. When looking at the minimum temperature it looks a little odd how it goes from a steady decrease from July to November, then a huge drop in December and then goes back up in January and then declines again afterwards. It is a very confusing pattern. It may have to do because of the lack of dates around the time which lead to a skewed average or just a cold front.\nSignificance of the Data The data found in this Xpath query was useful in trying to find out the patterns of temperature in Alexandria Egypt over the span of a year. This data gave a clearer picture of how the climate in Egypt didn’t change drastically since of its geographical location being in the desert. It never really got too cold but you could a gradual decrease in temperature over the winter time and gradual increase in temperature over the summer time. This data will be useful in determining whether or not these patterns are supported by an outside source that probably has more accurate information on the subject.\nHistorical Context Temperature Patterns in Egypt over the past 100 years This article shows the trends of temperature from 1900 to 2010 in Alexandria, Egypt and other parts of Egypt. This article shows the bigger picture of the climate change that has been happening in Egypt using a larger sample size than the one we used in the analysis project. To make a conclusion about global warming being present in my data would be difficult to do because the data I have is limited and I don’t have enough data to show the change from one year to another so my sample size is very limited in what it represents but it works with the article I have provided to show the bigger picture of how a gradual increase of temeprature has been occuring in certain areas of Egypt in every single season.\nResearch Remarks After doing this research, there were a few remarks that I would like to point out regarding the accuracy of a given data element and how that can ultimately skew your research. Initially, as I began constructing my XPath Query, as I’ve discussed before, the data isn’t always perfect. The query did not yield results for every single day in all 3 years. The results were dense in the earlier years but as time went by, that data began to thin out, making it very difficult to pick apart data that can accurately represent what I am trying to research. Even though the data that was presented, yielded, some of the measures were wrong, due to human error. For me, as I was dealing with averages across each month, the human error threw my data visualization off-proportion, in which I had to change. I am by no means saying that these digital methods of acquiring data are bad. In fact, the ability to use a query to yield results from various newspapers over …","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"9675e953fb1e467f79914d9ee9fe31fc","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hernandez/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-hernandez/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction Over the last few decades, the topic of global warming has gotten huge publicity all around the world. This analysis was created with the purpose of finding out whether or not global warming has been occuring specifically in Alexandria, Egypt by taking data found from May 1906 to April 1907 and comparing it to an article I found that lists the temperature change in Alexandria Egypt over the last 100 years to see if there has been an increase in the average temeperature and if so what could be the leading factors in the climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Alexandria, Egypt (May 1906-April 1907)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Moriah House"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"For my analysis project, I wanted to find data on where accidents occurred that were covered by the Egyptian Gazette. To do this, I started with the Xpath query //div[contains(., \u0026#34;ACCIDENT\u0026#34;)]//placeName to find articles containing the word accident and a place name tag. This produced 279 results. To see which of these were classified as international, I used the query //div[@feature=wire][contains(., \u0026#34;ACCIDENT\u0026#34;)]//placeName to search only in the Wire/Telegram section. This produced only 51 results, which were interestingly entirely in Europe and North America, with the one exception of a story from Jaffa, in Israel. This tells me that the Gazette reported on telegrams exclusively from the western world, most likely because the telegram system did not yet reach the rest of the world. I knew that people don’t always use the place name tag, so I was missing some relevant articles. To help find some of these, I used regular expressions and searched for “accident at \\w+”, which produced 10 additional results. I then used this data to create a simple bar graph in Tableau, showing the frequency of the occurrence of each location in reference to accidents.\nI also wanted to produce a geographical display of the data, so I used google maps to produce a simple map with pins in each location that occurred. The first layer, with blue pins, is the data from my initial broad search, and the second layer, with yellow pins, is the data I got from the Wire/Telegram section. This shows the spread of where the accidents occurred, but does not show the frequency of occurrence in each location, which is why I included the bar graph as well.\nThis data reveals that the Egyptian Gazette covered accidents that happened all over the world, but naturally the highest occurrences were in places in Egypt, especially in the Nile River Delta. You can also tell that Cairo is the largest and most industrialized city in Egypt, because it is mentioned in reference to accidents almost twice as many times as Alexandria, the city that the paper was in. This means that significantly more accidents occured in Cairo, because an accident would not have to be as noteworthy to be covered by the Gazette if it occurred in Alexandria than if it occurred in Cairo, and yet Cairo still has almost twice as many occurrences.\nOn a global scale, you can tell that there is an important British presence in Egypt, because many cities in England are mentioned, especially London (which makes sense) and Liverpool. This tells me people in Alexandria care about accidents that occur in England because they are from there and/or have investment/business ties there. Interestingly, nowhere in South America or Australia was mentioned in reference to accidents, which could suggest that people in Alexandria do not place as much value in the news about these places, or perhaps that accidents that are considered newsworthy are less likely to occur there.\nThe map also shows that newsworthy accidents occurred in all parts of the mediterranean, and this indicates that people in Alexandria wanted to be informed about Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East because all of these places were geographically close and therefore relevant.\nIn her article Alexandria, 1898: Nodes, Networks,and Scales in Nineteenth-Century Egypt and the Mediterranean, Lucia Carminati writes “The idea of this body of water itself is thus put to test: instead of a physical or methodological barrier, we must understand it as a space that enabled connectivity… Scholars have been challenging the idea that a stark border divided Europe and the Middle East up until modernity.” This data supports this idea that the Middle East and Europe are deeply entwined, despite the “East vs. West” mindset held by many people.\nThe British held some form of control in many parts of the world at this time, and yet this is not really displayed by the data. There are a few references to accidents in India, which was a british colony, but there is no coverage relating to accidents in Canada or Australia, which were under British dominion. The large cluster of British colonies in Africa to the south of Egypt are notably absent as well. This suggests that people in Alexandria did not place value in news from other countries under British control, which suggests that the British Empire at the time was not entirely cohesive. Britain was like the hub of a wheel, and all of the colonies were more like spokes, attached to the hub but not to each other. This could be a factor that led to the rapid decline of British Imperialism over the course of the 20th century. In Lord Cromer’s Ancient and Modern Imperialism, he writes “The great Imperial problem of the future is to what extent 350 million British subjects who are alien to us in race, religion, language, manners and customs are to govern themselves, or be governed by us.” He suggests that the problem with modern European Imperialism was that they had failed to assimilate the conquered …","date":1575072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575072000,"objectID":"a7439d81aa7fd0e727490627dcb18eb6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-house/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-house/","section":"post","summary":"For my analysis project, I wanted to find data on where accidents occurred that were covered by the Egyptian Gazette.

It was about an article written by the editor of Al-Watan, criticizing a news story published in several other native newspapers (which the editor called the “Opposition Press”) criticizing the “Ministers of his Highness”, saying that they had spent all day calling important people in Cairo and trying to persuade them to honor and give money to Lord Cromer, and that they were “met with refusal and left with failure everywhere!” This suggests that there was strife between the different native newspapers around the presence of Britain in Egypt. In the Al-Watan article, the editor is very positive towards the British, referring to them as gentlemen, and saying he had the “honour of calling upon” them. He is very critical of the Opposition Papers, saying that the news story was a “bare-faced fabrication without a shadow of truth.” This tells me that some of the Native newspapers did not support the British presence, and published articles that portrayed them negatively, while at least one, Al-Watan, was very much in support of the British presence and even came to their defense against the Opposition Papers. In the book Nurturing the Nation: The Family Politics of Modernizing, Colonizing, and Liberating Egypt, 1805-1923 by Lisa Pollard she writes, of the native papers in Egypt in the early 1900s, “While editors differed in political orientation- some encouraged continued Ottoman Sovereignty while others demanded egypt for the Egyptians- they appear united in their demands for increased political participation for Arabophone Egyptians in politics.” This suggests that Al-Watan was notable in its support of the British, which may be why the Egyptian Gazette published this article. In another article from May 23rd, 1907, the native press in India is described as “preaching a crusade of rebellion with the unrestrained oratory in which both native writers and readers exult.”\nIn Lord Cromer in the ‘Egyptian Gazette’, Melissa Pregasen writes that Lord Cromer “advocated for more British rule over the lands and dismissed the Egyptian demands for independence from Britain.” It seems that the native press largely opposed Lord Cromer and his Government, which is why this article was noteworthy.\nIn a letter to the editor from January 28th, 1907, a reader wrote that he thought it was unwise to threaten the natives with sending more troops in, because many of them thought there were only two dozen or so troops in Alexandria, and they could use this to their advantage. I thought this was interesting because clearly the editor of the Egyptian Gazette was reading the native papers, as evidenced by The Native Press; A False Charge, but as they published this letter openly describing a way the natives could be deceived, it would seem they did not think that the natives would read their newspaper.\nThey clearly considered it newsworthy that this event occurred in the native press, most likely because an overwhelming majority of the time Britain being slandered, not defended, by native papers.\n","date":1574294400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574294400,"objectID":"c92cad507e47b6b763bb3eb11875c8e1","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-11-20-moriahhouse/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-11-20-moriahhouse/","section":"post","summary":"Alexandria had more than one newspaper...","tags":["government","natives"],"title":"Al-Watan and the Native Press","type":"post"},{"authors":["Austin Kim"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"I was looking through my papers and noticed an interesting article that didn’t seem to align with the theme of the local newsletter.

As I read I realized that even though she did just seem like another local, the point of the article was to show how every citizen is important and it made sure to explain how she was a quality person and her death was to be mourned as many of the locals in Luxor and Cairo cared for her.\n“Each and Everyone of Us Is Unique and Important, and No-one Is Insignificant”\nI find this fascinating because there are two other instances I found while browsing through the blog posts in which the Egyptian Gazette has done this. For example:\nIn the death of Haicalis Pasha Death of Mr. Hanna In both instances the newsletter is reporting local deaths and it shows that the community do care about its people and that no passing is meaningless.\nOne of the important things that was pointed out in the Obituary is how Miss Collins spent a majority of her time at church and actually passed while at a Sunday Service.

As a train was traveling from Crewe to Bristol, it got into this accident in this town located right in the middle of the two cities and resulted in the death of 19 and injured 40.\nAlthough the incident occurred, the cause of what happened is still uncertain. In an article, found here, the officials at the scene examined the driver, and found out that he was not intoxicated nor under any influence of drugs, making the situation even more difficult to pinpoint. In another article, found here, they have another spectulation on why the incident came about, many officials believing that he was sleepy. The article reads:\nThe upshot was that approaching Shrewsbury, sleep overcame him. He passed Harlescott crossing and Crewe Bank without knowing it, and did not see the signals at danger, and on the downward gradient coming in to Shrewsbury the train picked up speed rapidly.\nThe incident itself, even after 100 years, is something to always keep in mind. From another article, a member of the Shrewsbury Railway Heritage Trust, Dave Giddens, believes that the incident should never be forgotten. In his own words he says:\n“It’s very good, even after 100 years to still remember the people who were involved in it and the people that lost loved ones,”\nIn comparison, there are other incidents in the Egyptian Gazette that also involves train crashes, in one blog post by Gavin Clark, another incident involving a train accident was published in the newspaper in 1906. But instead of it being an actual crash, the train caught on fire. In another blog post, made Will Hanley himself, entails an incident where a Prince was killed in an unusual car accident as he was hit by a train. Just from this, it can be concluded that train safety has definitely advanced in the 100 years. Nowadays, you rarely hear of a train crash, resulting in the death of people, where back then it seemed as if this was a common occurence.\nLastly, one might ask “Why would a train accident be newsworthy in an Egyptian newspaper?”. The answer is simple, Britain took control over all parts of Egypt back during the time this was written. Acting as a protectorate under British rule, this lasted from 1886 to 1914. Because of this, it was very common to find British news all throughout the contents of the “Egyptian Gazette,” where the editors themselves were often at times British. At the same, for this incident specifically, it was located in the Telegrams section, where they report news from all around the globe.\nPhoto of the Railway accident in Shrewsbury as officials are investigating the scene.

He started up his business from a small local shop in London. The shop sold traveling related products such as guidebooks, traveling wears, and maps. Several years later in 1872, he expanded his business with his son John, reformed the company as “Thomas Cook \u0026amp; Son”. (1) Throughout the course, we found that Thomas Cook \u0026amp; Son travel company had frequent updates on their advertisements. And they also sponsored the Egyptian Gazette profoundly by putting their advertisements on the title page banner. The company had various travel package options in the Middle East. It was the early age that civilians could afford the expenses and take ships to another continent. In parallel to the analysis of advertisement on the Egyptian Gazette by Olivia Evanoff (2), she wrote that\n“people could pay the fees that go along with it in that period.”\nIt is plausible the early 20 Century is prosperous era in economy. As the company grew, it also owned hotels in Britain primarily, Western Europe, North America, and Middle East. Suggested by a blog post by Kailen Chapple (3), the company had an enormous impact in the 19th Century. Kailen also remarked,\n“It is a new concept … a product of the industrial revolution.”\nThomas Cook ceases trading However, the glory of this family business could not thrive with the competitions in travel markets in 2019. Nowadays, people have more options for traveling. They gradually not rely on package-tours or travel agents. The way people used to travel is changed since it has became more accessible and easier to go foreign places without tour companies. Thomas Cook failed to transfer its tactics with modern travel behaviors, was defeated by other LCC (low-cost company) airlines competitors. It was bought in low stock value due to its 2.1 billion U.S. Dollars debt (4). The bankruptcy also interrupted approximate 500 thousand travelers’ plans. And about 30 thousand Thomas Cook employees lost their jobs. Here is a footage about a pilot of Thomas Cook Airlines in his last day job (5). The company sinks into debt, but its employee tries their best to serve their passengers with professionalism.\nThough it is the oldest travel company in Britain, the British government refuses to offer it bankruptcy protection. It may no longer have value to people, and the government can’t waste taxpayers’ money on an obselete industry.

But when I first saw this ad and researched a bit about its possible background, it came to my surprise that there was barely any information on the event, and it didn’t have a specific title to search by either. Using our present media and technology outlets, it would seem as if the event never occurred. But according to the newspaper, a vessel embarking from Alexandria en route to Brussels went missing months prior in the same year of 1907. It did not say much about the last place the vessel was seen, and all it said about its passengers was that they were men, women, and children all travelling to Brussels for various reasons, including work and vacation.\nIn researching events during that time period that could match up with the ad included in Tuesday’s issue, I found multiple sources that helped me to interpret the event. In the beginning of my findings, I came across an image that represents what an Egyptian vessel would have looked like at the time of this ad’s publication. This image and the page is linked ​here​.

This article was about how an older wealthy lady named Waghida Hanem seemed to have had her feelings captured by a young man, whom her family believed was only after her substantial finances. The young man successfully convinced Ms. Waghida to leave for Zagazig to meet and marry him along with jewels and money valuing around 20,000 pounds. At the news of the marriage the family of the bride demanded the revocation of the marriage and subsequent divorce of the bride and groom which was granted through the correct legal proceedings. Ms. Waghida was left in the care of her brother which she refused and took refuge with her lawyer however she has now disappeared without a trace.\nThis article was interesting to me for a number of reasons. One being that you don’t hear many cases today of young men trying to get with older women for their money, most of the time it’s the other way around with young women trying to find that rich lonely man to latch onto. Another thing I found interesting was how the family was able to literally nullify the marriage without the consent of either the bride or the groom and the fact that it was completely legal. There has been ongoing debate and trials regarding ways to legally nullify marriages in the U.S as outlined here, though I know of no way in America for someone who has no part in the marriage to nullify it against the bride and groom’s wishes so the fact that this was allowed amazes me. However here it is shown how in India a marriage may be nullified for a variety of reasons including if either the bride or groom was declared mentally unsound. This could be attributed to the laws in India that require a woman to have a male guardian so they are seen as less than women are seen in America. I read an article here on how a marriage was made null and void by a court in India over the fact that it was believed the daughter was forcibly converted to Islam. Apparently this isn’t extremely uncommon for countries other than the U.S.\nInterestingly enough I found a blog post here where the author decided to write an article about the fact that marriages were seen as a way for women to be happy and the author seemed extremely upset with that belief. I found it ironic considering Mrs. Waghida’s family forcibly put an end to her marriage even though she inferably was happy. You could say that her family was trying to prevent her from getting her heart broken by this swindler or just hurt in general because as outlined here where a man attempting to fix his relationship with his wife ends up stabbing her out of anger, domestic violence was not uncommon.\n","date":1571356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571356800,"objectID":"283b356d9ebabdf39794062219517a59","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-17-robertthomas/","publishdate":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-17-robertthomas/","section":"post","summary":"An elderly rich lady supposedly found love with a man, but her family believes he is only with her for her money.

While I was expecting there to be education mainly for men or higher public figures, but actually found that education is important to the people of this time in this area, and education for orphans, children of the lower classes, and even young boys (making more elementary schools)(1905-04-14). There are even scholarships being offered, as seen in 1905-05-06, and there is desire to keep improving the educational standards of years to come, and desires to make use of the educational facilities such as the “Museum,” one of the most famous schools in Alexandria (1905-04-12).

This time period seems to be the time for advancements in education in which fund are being put out to make educational buildings, everyone is beginning to get an education, and education is valued. At this time in Egypt, education has made tremendous improvements like an increase in the literacy rate and by a drop in the number of kids outside of school, but still faces some challenges such as the size of school not being able to accommodate the amount of children in Egypt and social issues arise in schools that get in thee way of the higher education of students.

Whoever wrote the review said that the publication “appears to contain nothing startling” and “is as feeble as Mr. Blunt’s last notorious pamphlet.” Given Blunt’s usual mix of erotic poetry and political statements, I wonder which apparently uninspiring work is being referenced here. The reviewer condemns the focus on “accounts of Mr. Blunt’s own interventions,” an odd criticism given the book’s clear self-identification as a “Personal Narrative,\u0026#34; as well as his numerous mentions of Prime Minister Gladstone’s opinions. Gladstone’s name is indeed referenced 109 times within the book. However, seeing as Gladstone had an immense amount of influence over British politics in the late 19th century, his inclusion in Blunt’s narrative seems fitting. As no information about the author is provided for the review, there is little way of deciding whether the reviewer’s disdain of Blunt is due to literary or political reasons.\nWilfrid Blunt held such contentious opinions as supporting Celtic and African freedom from the British empire. As the Egyptian Gazette was highly supportive of British imperialistic efforts (it was, after all, written for Englishmen and Frenchmen residing in Egypt), it makes sense that the writers would disapprove of Blunt. Blunt had a long and tumultuous history with Lord Cromer, consul general of Egypt and darling of the Egyptian Gazette. Blunt was Cromer’s political enemy. In a time when few British individuals opposed colonialism, Blunt encouraged opposition to the British agenda. Oddly enough, despite their political differences, Blunt and Cromer seemed to be friends of a sort. Cromer even accompanied Blunt’s daughter Judith at her wedding in Blunt’s place.\nWilfrid Scawen Blunt I question whether the reviewer actually read the book, as he relies heavily on another newspaper’s thoughts. This is what caught my attention the most. It is a review based on another review of a book. It begins with the words “The ‘Daily Chronicle’ publishes an advance review of Mr. Wilfred Blunt’s book…” and ends with “From the review in question I would consider…” I suspect that any attempts to unravel this mystery would have to begin by examining the political leanings of the Daily Chronicle and the work itself.\n","date":1571356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571356800,"objectID":"9941925fa919d5b33ac751897347d102","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-18-baileeku/","publishdate":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-18-baileeku/","section":"post","summary":"An anonymous author loathes a book he has not read.","tags":["literature","opinion"],"title":"Review of a Review of a Review of a Book","type":"post"},{"authors":["Damian Grant"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"“ROYAL TRAIN DERAILED” was the headline that caught my attention in the October 30, 1907 issue, in which the train carrying the King and Queen of Spain and their infant prince son came off the rails as a result of the “carelessness of a local engine driver.” Shortly after this story, within the same page, was another story with the headline “Train Collision” with yet another description of a “careless employee.” I became curious if there existed a trend in accidents being caused by “careless” train workers.\nI performed a query to find all instances of the descriptor “careless” found in the same division a “train” was mentioned.

Held at St Paul’s on Wimbledon Common, the wedding itself was not the smallest, nor the biggest; it was the perfect size for the new couple. Many family members from both the bride and the groom were in attendance along with the groom’s army colleagues and battalion. The service was conducted by the godfather of the groom and was completely choral.\nMiss Hirell Clarence, the bride-to-be, wore a gorgeous white satin gown paired with a long veil made of tulle and a headpiece with orange blossoms perfectly arranged on it. On the other hand, the bridesmaids wore colorful gowns. Each gown was cream colored, decorated with gold tassels and gold thread, and was paired with dark green satin hats. Their bouquets held yellow roses and were tied off with a cute green ribbon, which complemented the bridesmaids’ hats. As his gift to the bridesmaids, the groom gave each of them a white enamel and gold bracelet with small, purple amethysts on them.\nFollowing the lovely ceremony, the wedding party moved to the location of the reception. The reception was held at Castle Towers, and to make the day even better, the weather was perfect which allowed the reception to be held on the patios of Castle Towers. The newlyweds also hired the Royal Warwickshire Regiment who played some lovely music and gave a romantic mood to the newlyweds’ reception. At the reception, the newlyweds were given a number of wedding gifts such as a silver pepper-port, a stamp box made from copper, a silver mounted jack jug, and many other useful presents.\nIn another blog post, a different wedding is reported with the same title. This one describes the marriage of Captain Charlton and Gwendoline Whitaker, who also wore a crown of orange flowers to her ceremony. This blog post hits on the facts that even now, marriages are normally not publicly broadcasted unless it is a wedding of importance. The marriage of Captain Charles Massie Blomfield and Miss Hirell Clarence was published in the “Egyptian Gazette” along with very personal details of the wedding.\nThis article was published in the “Egyptian Gazette”, so the question still remains: why would people in Alexandria want to read about the marriage of two London locals? After conducting some research, it appears that the groom, Captain Charles Massie Blomfield was born in London, but lived in Port House, Alexandria until the age of nine. His father was the man in charge of the Port of Alexandria and then Director General of all ports in Egypt. With this kind of history in Egypt, it is hard to imagine that Captain Blomfield and his new wife would not have an article of their wedding published in the “Egyptian Gazette”.

There are many different occurrences of death and they occur in all different ways. The one that stuck out to me the most was drowning. On page 3 of the Monday February 25, 1907 issue the story “Well Known Minister Drowned” caught my attention. This article talks about the death that occurred during sea travel from Liverpool to Alexandria. A reverend gentleman had fallen overboard during a storm. However, this was not the only death stated in the article. A few days prior the ship’s carpenter had drowned.\nAlthough it is a common topic in this paper, I wonder why they don’t go into detail about what happened to the minister that drowned. They merely state the fact that he went overboard during a storm. It is also interesting that there were two occurrences of drowning on the same boat in the same time. This makes me wonder how many others were effected in this same way. I went to explore more about death by drowning or shipwrecks and struggled to find data specific to Egypt. However, I did come across a source that showed many shipwrecks that occurred between 1833 and today, showing that shipwrecks were more common in this 1900s period. This could also be because ships were used to transport exports such as cotton. Egypt shipped cotton and other materials to Britain using ships. Although these would not be the same ships as the one the minister drowned on it is important to note that they were commonly used for many things.\nAlso, this death occurred during travel which is something that has happened to many people in 1900s. In the blog post “Cairo Visitor gravely Injured”, the article examined also looks at death that occurred while someone was traveling. They also questioned how in-depth incidents were investigated at the time. Death was also talked about in other blog posts. In many cases there are posts about the plague, which appears to be a more common way to die at this time.

Disease and illness became an everyday battle for those who had been discharged as “incurable” with no hope for a healthy life. Marketing ploys done for many “patented” drugs, such as “Dr. William’s Pink Pills for Pale People”, fed on this vulnerability not knowing that many diseases did not even require medical intervention.\n“Pink Pills for Pale People” grew immensely in Great Britain and North America for their shiny pink coat and claims to cure TB, rickets, kidney diseases, and even paralysis. A new “miracle” drug had been invented that seemed to cure fatal diseases in a matter of days, purifying the “bad blood” that resulted in muscle and nerve disorders.\nOne case was that of a young daughter named Sophie Caspeele who suffered from a severe case of anemia: chronic weakness, loss of appetite, and poor digestion. Claiming to cure female ailments, marketing practices such as this one tugged on the heart strings of parents and suffering women. The pills became well-known and named for the healthy complexion that they restored to its patients.\nLater, the famous “Pink Pills” were discovered to contain merely “extract of Barbadoes aloes enclosed in a thick coating of sugar, colored with pink carmine”, yet continued to be sold into the 20th century. The “Pink Pills” were eventually exposed for quackery and withdrawn in the UK in 1970.\nThough still flawed, this case of medical negligence shows the improvement needed and made within the pharmaceutical industry relied on by many even today.

Well, at least this is the case for novelist Pierre Loti who seems to have struck gold in the next piece of his mummy collection. Yes, you read that correctly. Pierre Loti possessed a collection of ancient Egyptian Mummies. This new mummy is said to hold a young princess and Loti claims it is one of the best in his collection, but never explains in what way. Best preserved? Best wrapped? Either way, Mr. Loti seems to be excited about his find. In Loti’s book La mort de Philae, he records his visit to Egypt and the Museum of Antiquities in Cairo as can be seen here.\nPierre Loti was born in 1850 in Rochefort, France. His birth name is Louis Marie-Julien Viaud with Pierre Loti being his pseudonym. He was raised in a very religious family, reading the Bible every day and originally aspiring to become a pastor. His career path changed as he desired to adventure around the world. More information about Loti’s upbringing can be found in this article.\nSuperstitions run high in Egypt during this time and touching the dead is a big no. With religion being a focal point in Ancient Egypt, mummification was believed to be a way to preserve the body for resurrection as described by this article. A Blog post by Claudia Richardson mentions that the dead were buried with an abundance of food for the afterlife. Gwen Lofman in her Blog Post titled Egyptology \u0026amp; Archeology mentions how the newspaper served as a medium to share the discovery of these mummies. Loti explains how none of his servants would lay their hands on the body, which resulted in Mr. Loti having to transport it himself. Only when he arrived upstairs with the mummy did he realize he was holding on to a corpse. Either way, he added it to his study just as a kid would add a trophy to his trophy case and went along with his day. A typical day apparently in the life of Pierre Loti. Now if all this didn’t give off enough of an ominous vibe, right by Mr. Loti’s desk in his study resides the mummy of a three year old girl who watches as Loti writes.

Despite being written in the early 20th century, the facts presented in this article are very consistent with the science we see to be true nowadays. The author states that a mosquito does not actually have a poison gland, but instead delivers some sort or irritant through its saliva. While that is true, we have more information regarding that matter now. We know now that the irritant is actually a protein in the mosquito’s saliva to which most humans tend to have an allergic reaction to, as stated here. The article states that only female mosquitoes “bite” people, which is supported in modern times as well, shown here. It also claims that more of them tend to be found around swampy areas, which is supported here. As we can see, the information provided in this article is factual and not outdated. This allows it to be a very functional expository piece.\nHowever, the article is also humorous and almost satirical. Because of certain pedantic and condescending phrases such as “we in England”, “if you prefer it”, and “that other annoying parasite”, the author seems to have an inflated sense of self. When they describe the mosquito’s saliva and how different bites come with different magnitudes of discomfort, they follow it by saying that it does not matter since people are bitten regardless. They abruptly shift from giving information to completely dismissing its relevance. Things like this would normally indicate that they think they are above the reader in all possible ways, but due to it being so excessive and exaggerated, it is clear that they are using and arrogant tone to convey some sarcasm.

His attempt for a new system of government led to political and social unrest across the Russian Empire. Although this movement originally began many years before 1905, the “Bloody Sunday” massacre on the 22nd of January of that year is known to have sparked this revolution (Shimazu). When a bunch of workers, specially the poor, took on the streets and made their way to Tsar’s Palace in hopes of presenting a petition for better working conditions, they were welcomed with gunfire. Worker strikes, urban uprisings, and peasant revolts continued over the next several years (Heywood).\nNow this is all just basic research that anyone can learn about using the internet. However, I wanted to go on further into this topic as it caught my attention while I was reading the Egyptian Gazette newspaper. Before hand, I had no clue about this event in history. Being in the class of Microhistory, I have been given the opportunity to access the archives, or newspaper articles, of the Egyptian Gazette. With this source, I was able to look into fresh insights of the roles individuals, social groups, and political parties played throughout the Russian Revolution.\n![Image label](1905-01-23-p3.jpg “OPEN REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA: People’s appeal to the Tsar. Conflicts with troops. Thousands killed!”\u0026#34;)\nAs I did my search query, I wanted to see what this newspaper had to say about the “Bloody Sunday” massacre. Therefore, I looked through the content folder for January 22nd of 1905 but no luck. However the following day, January 23rd, the Egyptian Gazette was full with information regarding this terrible event. According to the newspaper, it all began around 2 o’clock when huge crowds marched to the Winter Palace to present a petition to Tsar. The petition said, “Satisfy these demands and you make Russia happy and glorious. If you do not reply to the people’s prayer, we prefer to die in the Square before your Palace\u0026#34;, and sadly that’s what happened. Soon, the crowd started to run away and rapidly barricaded themselves across the city. Reading insights like, “troops were firing recklessly… The air is rent with cries of women and the angry shouts of men”, heavily portrays a tense mood. This day, full with unpleasant and dreadful memories for many, has come to be known as the “Bloody Sunday”.\nBut why, why and how did all of this start? What were the reasons that led to the Revolution in Russia? Looking through relevant posts I was able to find the factors that played a major role in this, other than the Bloody Sunday. Anthony Muniz argues in his blog post that they are four main factors. Things such as huge gaps between social classes, poor economy, land ownership laws, and “anger amongst the educated class”. Although I agree with Muniz, all of these problems wouldn’t have occurred if the Russo-Japanese War didn’t happen several years before. The citizens of Russia rose in revolutionary groups as they saw Tsar Nicholas II as a weak leader. Civilians didn’t just simply surrender. They immediately rebeled against Tsar’s inhuman actions in a fight that would go on throughout the next 3 years. The question is, will Nicholas II’s actions to preserve his autocracy have serious consequences or will his power over the military suppress any opposition? Jonathan Cannon was able to answer this in his blog post: “if the Tsar keeps the support of the army he can maintain power”. Conversely, his power over the military declined as soldiers began to support and fight alongside the rebels. Even so, in the end, the Russian government “won” as the Tsar remained absolute leader. While this may be true, peace only came about when promises were made to the citizens of a “people’s government” with amendments to come and a new Constitution.\nWorks Cited: Heywood, Anthony, and Jon Smele.

Tensions ran high as Russia was in the process of earning the distinct honor of being the first European nation to lose a war to a non-Western power (Japan), and the great powers were concerned if this, and the nascent but ultimately futile 1905 revolution, meant the decline of Russia as a major imperial power, which would certainly throw the delicate balance of alliances into chaos. But more sensationally, and closer to home, the German Kaiser Wilhelm II openly challenged French claims to incorporate Morocco into their sphere of influence, encouraging the Sultan Abdelaziz to convene an international conference to decide the fate of the kingdom. This is the age of sensationalist press too, where newspapers did not just report news, but had the power to make it as well. Journals mattered, and were a vital means of measuring (or controlling) public opinion, an invaluable tool for historians. Precisely when newspapers are at their yellow-journalistic, propagandic worse is when they hold the most value. The decisions of what stories to run, and how they are written reveal quite a lot about the mindset, values, and beliefs of not just the publishers, but their readership as well.\nAs the main English newspaper in colonial Egypt, the Gazette should roughly represent the overall average of British views, but what surprised me the most working on my week was the sheer variety of opinions, and none felt so jarringly dissimilar as those concerning Germany. With this project, I sought to find out whether there was a discernable pattern in when the Gazette published editorial articles critical or supportive of Germany, and for the most part it seems there is none, and changes in the frequency follow events in the news.\nMethodology and Structure This investigation sought to do two things; quantify a subjective piece of data (occurrence of a pro- or anti- Germany article), collect the data, and observe whether any patterns emerged.\nThe biggest potential fault of this investigation comes from the very beginning: how to measure what is an article’s stance on Germany? From the start I wanted to look at one thing in particular, not wires/telegrams, but articles. These were difficult to isolate because in the newspaper itself there is little regularity in which these appear and how they are presented, which means that in the encoded library it becomes that much more difficult to find them.\nTo do this, I used the following xpath queries:\n//div[@type=”article”]//p[contains(.,”Germany”)] //div[@type=”item”]//p[contains(.,”Germany”)] This is a bit of a “needle in a haystack” approach. I couldn’t use @element=\u0026#34;wire\u0026#34; because that would have only brought up results such as news telegrams, which do not contain the expression of opinion I was looking for. Nor am I sure would more specific queries have gotten me better results, because as mentioned above, what I am looking for is not always classified in the same way, and its page location can vary wildly (especially in 8 page issues).\nI went through these results (which contained many lines from standardized ads or referencing ship arrivals), and read the articles to determine its position. This is unfortunately the most subjective part of the process and thus the one most open to error. I classified any opinion article as pro- or anti- based on two factors. One was whether the article (and being published by the Gazette arguable the newspaper itself) considered the government or state of Germany as a threat either to the perspective of the writer of the article or as threatening to a third party (and not always a military threat, and it was rarely such an outright sentiment of fear or anger), and whether the article held sympathy for or encouraged the success of the German government or state. Both of these are because what would often happen is that the article would extol the virtues of the “German” while decrying his government, most often in the context of the supposed “failure” of the German state to maintain her colonial empire up to “correct” standards. Germans would be portrayed as successful despite coming from Germany, rather than because of it, which I took as a solid indicator of anti-German sentiment. But again, this is the most subjective part of the process, and I could not succeed in standardizing these criteria any deeper than that. It became a question of “you know it when you see it.” In any case, once I identified an article, I would go into the div header and add the phrase ana=”#german-positive” or ana=”#german-negative”.

My project was on wedding fashion, and this article talks about how women don’t consider marrying a man the ultimate way to get a happy life anymore. The writer of this article is very angry about it, saying “Where else [women’s papers] would anyone dare to imply that woman was sufficiently idiotic to believe that marriage “of itself alone” guaranteed anything?” I honestly kind of thought this article was funny. It was just funny to see the writer get so worked up they had to write an article about it that is mostly made up of quotes and not a lot of their own thoughts (pretty bad journalism if you ask me).\nSomething interesting about this was the fact that women are being blamed for the decline in marriage within this article, when there are incidents like one I found in a previous blog post- a crazy man killing his wife. Similar to in the Gazette, the writer of the blog post suggests the woman may be at fault for her unhappy marriage. They suggest that she might have cheated on her husband, causing him to kill her.\nSimilarly, there is another blog post, titled “Women Are Always Lying?”, which describes an article that rants about how women lie to men by changing their appearance (presumably through makeup). Women are depicted as “a creature of broad and gradual curves, whose first duty it is to persuade you that she is the shape of the fashionable corset…” I can’t speak for women back then, but now women really don’t dress up for the sake of impressing men.\nWhen women are treated like this by men in newspaper articles, its really no wonder why they create their own newspapers to say that “it is possible to be as happy without a man’s love as with it.”\n","date":1525305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525305600,"objectID":"ea80635f37dca602db29b991d8965949","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-pustam/","publishdate":"2018-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-pustam/","section":"post","summary":"Spoiler alert: yes.","tags":["marriage","weddings","women"],"title":"Can women be happy without men?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Greyson Porter"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"Golf in today’s day in age has come a long way since it was invented in the 19th century. The technology, how it is played, taught and how it is treated at country clubs. There were country clubs that had golf courses in the beginning of the 20th century around the word but the clubs didn’t usually revolve around the golf courses rather than the typical “sporting” club games such as croquet and other games played on nice grass surfaces. Golf has come a long way but it still was more popular in Egypt than most would assume in the beginning of the 20th century. The picture below was one of the first images that showed the initial relevance to golf in Egypt, it was taken at the Mena Club in Egypt and adds a bit of relevance to when golf started up in Egypt when this picture was posted in a golf magazine in 1898.\nGolf was invented in the UK in the 19th century and didn’t really become a popular sport around the globe til the 20th century. The English and the Scottish were the innovators of golf around the world because nobody knew about it until they began to share it with other countries, according to Places-Golf in Egypt. In Egypt in 1905, there were country clubs that had golf courses but most of the clubs where golf was popular there seemed to be a large influence of it from English members. For example, in March of 1905 the Suez Golf Club registered a tournament for the members to play in and over half of the contestants were English which shows much influence from them. However, as years went on, golf seemed to become more popular to the Egyptians most likely because of the English and Scottish influence that was relevant in Egypt.\nGolf tournaments in Egypt in 1905-1907 were much different than they are today around the world. After searching “golf tournaments” in the sport and play section in xml I found results from a couple tournaments and the formats of the tournaments were different from most of the tournaments in today’s day in age. This is most likely because of how golf was still a new game and people were still trying to learn how the game was played. The format of most of the tournaments I have read about in the beginning of the 20th century were different from what they are played around the world today. They were played in a “match-play” format rather than a “stroke-play” format like in today’s society. The format of match play is played on a hole by hole basis and is played in a “one vs. one” format. One person plays another and the score from each hole can result in 3 different outcomes; a win, loss or tie. Each hole is worth one essentially in the match and whoever has won the most holes after the conclusion of 18 holes has won the match. Stroke play in today’s day in age is much different because it is based upon a player’s total score over the course of 18 holes and is not played in “one vs one” format rather than a full field of however many players play and whoever has the lowest total score is the champion. Tournaments were played like this most likely because it is more enjoyable and an easier way to keep score against your opponents; it also makes the round of golf take a shorter amount of time and is a much easier way to play for those who aren’t as skilled as golfers are today. After analyzing much of the country club tournaments they are all played in a handicap format as well which is a way a less-skilled golfer can play a better player in a fair format. Handicap is based upon your average score from previous rounds and for those that are less skilled playing a higher skilled player gives them a “handicap” so they can compete fairly. Once again, this makes it more enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels to have a competitive match against anybody. The Suez Golf Club had two tournaments every month for their members; a bogey play tournament and a match play tournament. I configured this information from xml by searching for “golf clubs” in divisions and finding a sport and play section talking about the Suez Golf Club on October 18, 1905. A bogey play tournament is a format that is not common whatsoever now but was probably a more enjoyable way for those of less-skill level to enjoy competition. The tournaments in Egypt in the beginning of the 20th century were all ran by country and sporting clubs and took time to play. Since match play tournaments are played “one vs one” there were more rounds of golf to be played and this was in the form of a bracket. Therefore, these tournaments would take weeks to complete and those who lost a match would be immediately disqualified from the tournament because they would be knocked out of the bracket. Tournaments now are ran by organizations are much more competitive than they were over 100 years ago mainly because of the popularity of the sport. There was a tournament at Alexandria Sporting Club that included 3 different formats: match play, foursomes and stroke play. The championship format was match play in which M.

This incident caused the chancellor of the university to face repercussions from the government, being required to implement a new system for visitors at the institution.\nParts of Mr. Amos’ story do not add up. He claims that the students were rude to him, but at the time he visited the mosque, there was a commotion among the students due to a sudden rain shower. The chancellor of the school claims the visitors were probably sent in the direction of disorder, and that any claims of rudeness are simply a misunderstanding.\nThe writer of this June 13, 1906 article in the Egyptian Gazette seems to believe Mr. Amos. They claim that his job as judge of the Native Court means that he has thorough knowledge of Arabic and could not possibly mistake jostling for rudeness. They even go so far as to question if the chancellor of the school was there at the time of the incident. The writer of the article seems to have some preconceived notions about this university. They claim that an Indian student was recently made fun of for his political views.\nAccording to outside sources, Amos was born in 1872 in London. His full name was Percy Maurice Maclardie Sheldon Amos. He was appointed to the Cairo Native Court in 1903. He was educated at Cambridge and came from a very wealthy and well-known family. When considering the reasons for the unrest in the article, it is worth noting that Amos was a European man with a position of power in Egypt. European presence in Egypt was agitating to many Egyptians, and as a result caused unrest.\nThe article is not in any particular section of the paper, but is its own section.

I was particularly intrigued by the emphasis on marriage being placed in the Egyptian Gazette newspaper which is opposed to what we see in these modern times. One specific section in my reading that gathered my interest was titled “Alexandria Merchant Divorce” published on August 6, 1907.\nA brief overview about the story resulted in the end of a marriage between Mr. William Getty, a cotton merchant of Alexandria and his wife. Over the past years, she strayed away and disappeared from him, leaving him to wonder about her whereabouts and how she was doing. While on her death bed, she had an incurable diseases that she couldn’t be healed from. She wrote a letter to her husband confessing that she was unfaithful to him throughout the duration of their marriage. In defense of her statement, she felt that the money she had leftover should be given to him since she recently became a Christian Scientist.\nThis excerpt from the passage was quite interesting for me to read because I was fascinated with the explicit details provided and how it was shared with all of the world to see. Although they didn’t share a response from her husband after he received the message from her, I would have wondered what his thoughts, response or even last words to her would have been.\nIn reference to this article, I found another interesting topic from the “Egyptian Gazette” in another blog post about a crazy man killing his wife with an unusual weapon. Although there is no reason for his crazy acts, he committed the crime from speculations that his wife was cheating on him. The magnitude of this article was extremely huge enough to reach the newspaper because people thought the city should be aware of this person and who he is.

The editor well-articulated their points of the show, being critical but also giving a lot of praise. They begin with the overall thoughts, saying it began slowly, but within a little bit of time it picked up into a great show. The following paragraphs go deeper into the different performers and even the chorus. The editor praised all the performers on how well they sang, but nothing really on acting skill. They did go onto write the chorus was a failure of the performance, but did no effect the overall show.\nI really felt as if I went to this show, hearing and visualizing the actors throughout. It was very surprising to me to see such good talent being exhibited during this time period, but also the critic who wrote the excerpt was impressive. I did not know that Egypt had such a well-rounded society with a variety of quality entertainment options. However, I do not think it is anywhere as good as what we are seeing during the present day. Today’s entertainment is a wide variety of genres, which means actors must have a wide variety of skills. One of the analysis projects titled, “The Exploration of Musicians in Alexandria” agrees with this as well. Ragland, the editor writes that most of the performers were amateurs, but were still greatly supported by the community. He goes on to say that there are no negative reviews that he can find, and the “Los Huguenots” review is no different. The editor does nothing but praise the performance. One last thing I found interesting in his analysis was he said the amount of musicians in the Egyptian Gazette was outstanding. He does not give them by specific name, but mentions the sheer number that are mentioned.

My data was qualitative, not quantitative, so I couldn’t just find charts with what I needed and call it a day. Initially, I wanted to look at fashion trends and how they evolved within the 2 year period. However, as mentioned before, finding the data was difficult. Whenever I looked up ‘fashion’, it would refer me to a hotel ad. Back then, they used different terms to describe fashion. I had to come up with a way to find them. Eventually, I looked up ‘dress’ and found some wedding articles, so I decided to stick with that since the category of wedding dresses would be more consistent and a better way to compare clothing than normal streetwear.\nTo collect my data, I looked up the word ‘wedding’ within headlines, took all the articles, and copied and pasted them into a different document. I did the same with ‘marriage’, and within that document, I looked up the words ‘dress’ and ‘gown’. I would read the words around whatever came up, and created a spreadsheet of details I found on the dresses. Then I had to look up the article in the content repository again so I could get the date. I had to do this because simply looking up ‘dress’ would have gotten me a lot of articles I didn’t need, and just copying and pasting the results would only get me the 7 words around it, which was way too little information to work with. I logged in details of who wore the dress, who made it, what color it was, material, trim, bouquets, and more. Then I created a chart with as many of these details as I could find. Some of the data I collected was not reported with the other dresses (like with the creator of the dress, or with the bouquet), so these results could not be graphed. Obviously, this research relies entirely on how the newspaper reporter describes the dresses, the reporter could call something ‘pale blue’, when in reality, it could be ‘periwinkle’, or something like that. Most of the dresses are white, as expected, but some are referred to as ‘cream’, or ‘ivory’. I kept those as different colors because I wanted to see if different shades came into fashion at some point, or maybe there was a significance within the shades depending on class. I thought it was an important difference.\nThrough this project I aim to analyze the trends of Egyptian wedding dresses from 1905-1906 (I could not find any articles in 1907) to see what colors, materials, decorations, etc. get used and what trends get repeated, and if there is any change due to season (I’m thinking specifically with the flowers used). I’m hoping to find things that aren’t typically seen with American wedding dresses, and I want to look at what certain things such as material or color says about a bride. In the article Late-Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Wedding Costumes as Indicators of Social Change by Nancy Micklewright, she describes how certain things about a bride affect what the dress looks like “Her choice would have been determined by her religion, her social status (which in turn involved her family and its financial standing), and her education” (Micklewright 1). If these aspects are mentioned in the article, hopefully there is a correlation between the choice of dress and the features mentioned above. I feel like material will definitely be influenced by social standing.\nHere is a graph of what colors I found to be used and who wears them:\nAs said before, most of the colors were white. Wedding dresses are traditionally white, so this is no surprise. There was not a lot of variation within the bridal dresses in terms of color- ivory, silver, white, and crème. There is not a correlation between dates or seasons for these color variations. Additionally, there does not seem to be a difference in the kinds of people who wore this color (there are no descriptions of what kind of position these couples hold in society… one is married to a well-known contractor and that’s it. There’s a wedding of a princess described, and she wears white).\nHere is the graph that depicts the materials used in wedding dresses:\nSatin was the most frequently used and most consistent material. It appears to be used throughout the two years steadily. One dress uses ‘blonde lace’. This couple got married in London, in the same church that the king and queen of England had attended to view the wedding of Lady Alexandra Acheson’s marriage with the Earl of Derby’s son. The groom was the Captain of the Egyptian Army. Blonde lace appears to signify a very expensive dress. This was a bridesmaids’ dress, and from the article we can see it was very worked up. “charming gowns of white blonde lace on soft white satin, the bottom of the skirts trimmed with Empire wreaths of pink chiffon roses, set in by garlands of blue ribbon… trimmed at the back with little rosettes and short folded ends.

Specifically, I gathered information about the maximum temperatures and the minimum temperatures. This data was pulled from the section titled ‘Daily Weather Report’ from within the Egyptian Gazette newspaper. The section appears in almost every days’ issue and includes information such as the highs and lows in the shade, the humidity percentages, and the rainfall totals of all the major cities within Egypt during the early twentieth century. With the information on temperatures that was pulled from almost every day from 1905 to 1907 I was able to analyze the trends in seasonal changes. I observed to see if there were days or weeks where temperatures were too high or too low, resulting in the possibility of work being postponed or the possibility of people getting sick. Outside sources and credits made this process more fluid and really assisted in gathering information about safety requirements within a work place and the dangers of being in extreme hot or cold temperatures for set durations of time.\nThe locations of Port Said and Assouan are the key points of focus for my research. Port Said is a city that is in northern Egypt and located on the Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, Assouan is in southern Egypt, near the Nile River, and a part of the Sahara Desert. Both cities have vast differences in their climate and these differences are easily recognizable. For example, Port Said is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea meaning that it gets a sea breeze unlike Assouan. The sea breeze provides outlets for more moisture content to build up in the area, causing the overall weather-like symptoms to be rather humid and seem hotter on some days than it actually is. Unlike Port Said, Assouan is located in the midst of a desert, meaning that the temperatures fluctuate during the day and night. However, the climate of Assouan is notoriously dry and hot. The Nile River does provide some moisture that can increase the humidity, making the temperatures seem like they are hotter than they actually are, and vice-versa with wind coming off the river making temperatures seem cooler and more bearable.\nAnother locational difference that stands between the cities of Port Said and Assouan is the Tropic of Cancer. The line serves as a peaking point for the sun during the summer months in the northern hemisphere. On June twenty first of every year the sun appears directly overhead of the Tropic of Cancer marking the initial point and start of summer. The southern most city of the two, Assouan, is directly in the path of the sun during this time. The Tropic of Cancer is located on the latitude 23.5 degrees north, and Assouan is on the latitude 24 degrees north. In addition to being in the path of the Tropic of Cancer line, Assouan is also closer to the equator than Port Said is. When drawing a direct line that connects the two cities the distance between them is four hundred ninety-eight miles, or eight hundred one kilometers. This concludes that Assouan is nearly five hundred miles closer to the equator than Port Said is. For a better grasp of understanding on the distance I’ve included a comparison on distance from two cities in the U.S. From Miami, FL to Charleston, SC it is a direct distance of 485 miles. If you are a native of the Southern region of the United States or have ever travelled to Miami and Charleston during the peak of winter and summer, you know how different these climates and seasonal temperatures are.\nIn addition to differences in climate and seasonal changes, the data that I collected and observed for Assouan and Port Said were fairly different from one another. To show the data that was collected and then evaluated based on several averages I made two graphs. One graph is composed of the average maximum temperature for each month that the data was recorded for, and the other is the same, just with the average minimum temperature. Note that all the temperatures within ‘The Daily Weather Report’ were recorded in Celsius and not Fahrenheit.\nLooking at the graphs, you can see that there are numerous spikes within the data. The spikes occur around the month of July, and the month of January both for the maximum and the minimum temperatures. The maximum temperature spikes for Assouan are around forty to forty-three degrees Celsius. Meaning that the maximum average temperature for the month of July in all three years was 109 degrees Fahrenheit. The minimum temperature spikes for Assouan are around twenty-seven to thirty degrees Celsius. Meaning that the minimum average for the month July was eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit. That is a fluctuation of about thirty degrees per day, which is very common all around the world.\nThe maximum temperatures for Assouan in the month of January averaged at about twenty-three degrees Celsius, or seventy-three degrees Fahrenheit.

A man named Mr. Sequino, a worker for Sudan Railways, was the main topic of this article. He had somehow managed to shoot himself in the mouth. Yes, in the mouth.\nOwning a gun was unheard of in early twentieth century Egypt. Never the less owning a magnum, a powerful hand gun that packs a punch with a .45 caliber bullet. Working as a bridge foreman one day, Mr. Sequino ‘carelessly’ placed his gun down on a table and it managed to fall off. When reaching down to pick it up it fired a bullet straight at him, wedging the bullet through his two bottom front teeth, knocking them out, and sawing off part of his tongue. The event resulted in him having to take therapy lessons, basically learning how to speak again.\nGuns typically don’t fire on their own, they need someone to pull the trigger. How Mr. Sequino’s gun fired on its own before he even contacted it is just absurd. It really leaves someone wondering about his personality, and if people in early twentieth century Egypt roamed the streets with unsafe handguns.\nSpeaking of which, there are many articles within the Egyptian Gazette that give evidence that people owned and perhaps roamed the streets with guns and other types of weaponry. In my weekly issue there are instances where a rifle club appears, and there is an advertisement for the club practice. This means that people owned rifles in Egypt. Also, in an earlier week there is a mentioning about being able to trade in weapons for even better weapons that were once owned by criminals or murderers. These guns were taken away from them by the police, and then taken to a shop where citizens could trade or purchase them. Mr. Sequino might have purchased his revolver at a store like this, and as you can see, his purchase did not end in a good result.\nEvents like these are included all throughout the Egyptian Gazette.

This can be easily understood; as humans have been interested in death for centuries. However, I wanted to delve deeper into the kinds of deaths that were mentioned in the newspaper. Unfortunately, I came across a telegram that talked about a Jewish person’s death because of Anti-Semitic reasons. Because of this, I was moved to look into the Jewish condition in Egypt, as it is a relevant topic today and it had not been looked into my another classmate. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, they believe that “Alexandria in Egypt was the birthplace of anti-Semitism’s ideology. There also the first pogrom in history-as we now would call it-took place” (in 38 C.E.) (Horst). The Center also talks about how the first indication of a negative attitude towards the Jewish people stemmed from the writings of the Egyptian Priest, Manetho. He writes that “Jews are dangerous and enemies of humankind” (Horst). But, in an article in the Gazette, a writer states that “while the feeling of antagonism towards a race so unlike the rest of the world undoubtedly gained intensity and bitterness from misdirected Christian sentiment and passion, long before the Christian faith had gained ascendancy the streets of cities inhabited by Jews bad been reddened with Jewish blood” (“Egyptian Gazette,” 11/11/1905). Though many of these ideas and allegations happened long before the early twentieth-century, it is easy to see how effects of these beliefs may have still affected Egyptians during this time as well. Ironically, though, especially before the war, many Jews moved to Egypt to escape the strict regime of the Ottoman Empire, as Egypt was seen as “a safe haven and land of opportunity” (Takla 28). There was an increase in the number of Jewish refugees to Egypt during this time because of the increase in Anti-Semitic ideologies in surrounding countries. Because of this, I would like to see the extent in which Anti-Semitic ideologies are evident in Egypt during this time. Therefore, I will seek to answer the question: what Anti-Semitic ideas or events does the Egyptian Gazette include in their newspaper?\nTo do this, I conducted several queries of the entire Egyptian Gazette using a series of keywords, including Anti-Semitism, Jews, Jewish, and Anti-Semitic. Though I did specify in my query that I wanted to look in the telegram and local and general section, I realized that, because there were only so many mentions of Anti-Semitism, this specificity was not necessary for every search. With those searches, I found 18 solid, relevant results, ranging from articles discussing the Jewish condition in Russia to riots in Warsaw and Anti-Jewish attacks. To organize and analyze my data, I collected all the different locations that telegrams came from and categorized these events into instances of deaths, attacks, rallies, and support, to see what is actually happening in Egypt during the time.\nTo start, I looked at the places where these mentions are coming from, according to the dateline in the telegrams section. Most of the reports came from St. Petersburg and Warsaw; St. Petersburg was mentioned in the dateline eight times and Warsaw was mentioned six times. This information did present an interesting perspective on the Russian Revolution of 1905 and how that political freedom sparked Jewish freedom and, consequently, Anti-Semitic beliefs. Because this is such a major event and Russia’s geographical closeness to Egypt, it is understandable why this information made it into the “Gazette.” Some researchers also say that the freedom that happened in Russia stirred the Warsaw Jewish population to become more organized and prevalent. Because of the rapid readjustment of power, objectively it makes sense that it would be met with more resistance that would be documented in the newspaper. The Russian Revolution’s effect on its neighboring countries is also evident in two of the mentions of Anti-Semitic attacks that happened in Riga, which is part of Latvia, and Homel, which was a part of Belarus. In both of these places, natives pillaged Jewish shops, and, at Riga, the chief of police was killed. However, both of these events only had one sentence descriptions, which is very small compared to at other places. Perhaps it is because these cities are a lot smaller and less politically important than St. Petersburg and Warsaw. This shows that, though the Gazette is interested in documenting tragic events, they do focus on bigger cities and more well-known places. Therefore, the data I was able to collect may be skewed compared to the actual number of attacks that occurred. It is also interesting though, that Anti-Semitic events are more widely documented in the Gazette than the Jewish political growth. Perhaps this has to do with most people’s interest in death and other destructive elements.\nAnti-Semitism in Egypt was only mentioned once, on …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"25265a283eee86d0d1cb863479d0f1c5","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-northcutt/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-northcutt/","section":"post","summary":"When first reading the Egyptian Gazette, one can see how many times death is mentioned.

Over the course of this course of this class I have read countless articles on Lord Cromer and the Plague, but there has been little mention of children in Alexandria. With the help of Mr. Hanley I choose to further look into an area of history that this class has not studied. There is little known about children in Alexandria during the early 1900’s. A chapter in “Childhood in the Late Ottoman Empire and After” by Benjamin Fortna gave me the only insight I could find into childhood. He said “Girls stayed at home until around the age of five, when they would then begin fetching water and helping their mothers with such work as cooking, cleaning and making fuel cakes. Boys also usually stayed home until the age of five, when they would then begin to take the donkeys to the field or the buffalo to the canal” (Fortna). This gave me insight into the expectations of children, but I wanted to know more.Therefore, my analysis question is, how are children described in the Egyptian Gazette?\nProcedure After finalizing my analysis question, it was important to narrow down what I was looking for. My first step was to write an Xpath query that would find how many times child appeared in the Egyptian Gazette. I used //div[contains(.,\u0026#34;Child\u0026#34;)] and found over 18,000 results. I knew this overwhelming amount of data had to be better classified, so I choose to use another Xpath Query: //div[contains(.,\u0026#34;child\u0026#34;)]/@feature. This Xpath looks in all the div that contain the word child that fall under a feature in the Gazette. This Xpath had produced 297 results. I than took all 297 results and placed them into Atom. After cleaning up the results to only have the date and the feature name, I transferred the results into Tableau to make a graph. After looking over the results I realized that there were results that included information that was not about children. I felt it was important to only include information that related directly to children. This meant that I had to get rid of results that included last names. Instead of going through all the results individually using the Xpath from above, I broke the Xpath down further. I used the find and replace button on Oxygen. I first entered in the text to find box the word child and the restriction to Xpath was //div[@feature=\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;]. The question mark was replaced with any of the words that feature equalled on the graph. I started with @feature=“army” and ended with @feature=“wire”. This helped me eliminate the results that included last names and information that did not tell me about children in Alexandria. When I changed the restriction Xpath I found data that was not included in the original /@feature div, so I was able to add dates and features that were important for the graph.\nTableau Table Using Tableau I organized my results into features vs. years. I choose to get remove the year 1907 because there were little results and most of the results were prepaid advertisements. I made this table to see what feature of the Egyptian Gazette contained the most articles with children in them. If I could better pinpoint a section of the newspaper I could better collect data that would allow for me to see how children were described in the Egyptian Gazette.\nResults After creating the graph I found out that the most mentions of child was in the local and general section of the Egyptian Gazette. Prepaid Advertisements was the second highest, but most of these were advertisements that were repeated throughout the weeks. Advertisements told me about what children could wear and toys they had, but not much information about children themselves.\nLocal and General I decided to look into the findings of child in the local and general section of the newspaper. Overall, the mention of children ranged from a variety of different topics. The most interesting of these findings are: entertainment, child found, hospital, children and accidents and child weddings.\nEntertainment Throughout the local and general section children entertainment was a major reoccurrence. The San Stefano Casino hosted the Children’s ball. The Children’s ball was put on about seven to eight times during 1905-1906. The readings suggested that the ball brought together a large amount of young people. Through the reports made the ball appear elegant, tasty, and enjoyable. contained and The main feature of a ball mentioned on August 19, 1905 was a Massinet pavan, which was danced by children. Children seem to have danced and put on performances a lot for Alexandria events. Alexandria also started hosted matinee’s for children in 1906. Along with entertainment for children there were fundraisers that benefited the well-being of children in Alexandria. On February 8, 1905 The Germania lodge was hosting a ball that collected articles of warm clothing for indigent children. Another fundraiser was reported on April 26, 1906 saying the …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"6e1a45a2598aeed3a54394f08b6ac394","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-richardson/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-richardson/","section":"post","summary":"Analysis topic The Egyptian Gazette is filled with information from accidents to steamship schedules.

They are Carver Bros Company and Behrend Company. I will compare and contrast the goods that each company exports as well as their levels of success. I am analyzing data from the full content available to me from the Egyptian Gazette, meaning these results range from January 1905 through July 1907. I will also use them to exemplify the Egyptian export industry based off of research I have collected.\nSteps Taken Towards Completion and Problems in the Way 1. Query: While coding the Egyptian Gazette in XML I found an interest in economic topics, such as imports and exports. I wanted to know what goods were being shipped in and out of Egypt and what countries they were coming from and going to. Therefore, I figured it would be useful to use the data from the “Export Manifests” section. I tried using the xpath query //div[@feature=\u0026#34;exportManifests\u0026#34;] but a very large majority of the results were un-updated templates that had just been copied and pasted. So, with Weber’s help, I came up with a new query using regular expressions. In “text to find” I searched for behrend.+ and then restricted it to //div[@feature=\u0026#34;exportManifests\u0026#34;]. I did the same for Carver Bros. This gave me a unique set of results for each company that I could work with.\n2. Results: This is where I experienced the most difficulty. After copying and pasting the query results into Atom and cleaning it up using regular expressions I could not get my results to paste into Tableau for some reason. One of the companies worked fine, but the other would only paste as a single column instead of separating the data into a table. After some trial and error, Dr. Hanley was able to help produce results that could be transferred to Excel and then to Tableau.\n3. Visualizations: Analysis Before doing research on scholarly articles having to do with Egyptian exports, I tried to find any additional information on these two companies within the Egyptian Gazette. I did a query for “behrend” and “carver bros” in //div[n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;] but none of the results were very fruitful. The only results for “behrend” had to do with a rice mill owned by someone of the same name. Perhaps it is the same person, or maybe a relative. For “carver bros” the query returned results with information about the office of Carver Bros being a meeting place for the ‘British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt.’ It was also referred to as “a great cotton house.” Based off this limited information, I would hypothesize that Carver Bros was a larger and more successful company than Behrend.\nBased off of my results and my visualization, I can see that Behrend company exported fourteen products, while Carver Bros only exported eleven. If one were to simply look at the visualizations, one could make the assumption that the total amount of exports is about the same, since majority of the exports for both companies fall between zero and ten thousand units. However, concluding this would be innacurate because the unit type for each product is different. For example, cotton is sold in “bales” but cotton seed is sold in “tons.” Other things, such as onions and sugar, are sold in “bags.” Since it is unknown what constitutes a “bale” of Cotton or a “bag” of sugar, it makes comparing products difficult. Due to Behrend Company exporting an immense amount of beans, it caused outliers on the graph. I still want to include the data for beans since it is one of the products that both companies exported, so instead of excluding the outlier I changed the y-axis of the Behrend graph to a logarithmic format to make the graph more readable.\nIn comparing specific products, I will focus only on those that are shared between the two companies. These include cotton, cotton seed, beans, oil cake, and onions. Most of these products are shipped several times per year, however I find it fascinating that the Behrend company only shipped beans one time throughout the whole span of January 1905 to July 1907. Not only were beans exported only once, but it was the biggest shipment from the Behrend company in that entire two and a half year span. This makes me wonder if beans could only be harvested and shipped one month out of the year (April, in this case) or if London had another, more valuable, source of bean imports.\nIt is easy to tell by looking at the visualizations that Carver Bros is largely a cotton company, with its main two exports being cotton and cotton seed. Although it out-exported Behrend in cotton itself, Behrend actually exported much more cotton seed than Carver Bros. Carver Bros also only sold 384 units of onions and 126 units of oil cake, compared to Behrend’s 19,997 units of onions and 996 units of oil cake. Based on looking at these visualizations and analyzing the data one could conclude that Behrend was a much more diverse and probably more successful company. Behrend not only exported more total products, but also exported more …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"65ffae580c3f05e0071e79164d8349c6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-ebert/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-ebert/","section":"post","summary":"My analysis project focuses on two companies that ship goods from Egypt to England.

When temperatures become so high, it can be extremely easy to ignite or cause a fire by heat from the sun. The topic that I am going to analyze for this paper is the fires that appear in Alexandria, Egypt and that are accounted for and the amount of fatalities marked in each. This topic sparked my attention after hearing about the past several years of the wildfires in California. The week that was given to me was the week of February 11th, 1907. With a fire the rate of survival can decrease, and the costs of damage and replacements can increase. The question of interest is if there is a high number of deaths due to fire, is that the reason there is so many insurance company advertisements within the Egyptian Gazette.\nLooking through issues of the Egyptian Gazette, I found several features and advertisements about fire. I was interested to see how many fires were accounted for and the amount of fatalities that were acknowledge within each instance. I became interested in the trends that may also carry over to insurance companies of the Alexandria and Cairo area seeing if the reason there is so many is due to the amount of fire that are counted for in Egypt.\nAfter downloading a copy of the master content from GitHub, the first preliminary query I ran was for any div type item that contained the word fire, which resulted in coming upon several fire incidents, but as well as a variety of insurance companies. Upon first glance, this information would indicate that there were various occasions of fires in the early 1900s, but with additional inquiry, a lot of those instances of the word “fire” were advertisements for insurance companies. These advertisements are still relevant to my project and will come into play in further explanation. I took into account that where most of the fire instances were being reported was in the “Local and General” section of each issue where there was an outbreak of a fire.\nWith the primary knowledge of this project being from the repository, I also took it upon myself to research the history of fires in Egypt in the early 1900’s. Much to my dismay, my research came up short when the only incident of fire I came across was in Cairo Egypt much later in the 1950s called the Cairo fire, also known as Black Saturday. Cairo Fire was a series of riots that took place on 26 January 1952, marked by the burning and looting of some 750 buildings. If the riots of Cairo were bad in the 1950’s, there could be a likelihood that they were not as far off in the early 1900’s.\nBy looking through the repository with the keywords “fire” and “death”. which focused on the number of fatalities in reported fires, Each XPath query was searched with an item containing the word “fire”. When first using the term, there were over two hundred results, however upon looking through them it is easy to see they don’t fit the article type I need. Some of these articles simply talk about advertising for insurance companies and the rest would only indicate that a fire occurred, but no other details were given. Getting further into my research I soon realized that these findings weren’t the most helpful, there were not a lot of deaths with each report of a fire. At this point I decided to change my research from the amount of deaths reported in each fire instance to the reason of each fire. After doing this I erased my keyword “death” and just decided to look through the “Local and General” section to see the reports of fire and the origin of each one.\nWhen discussing with other classmates about their analysis projects, as well as looking on GitHub, a lot of them seemed to have the same problem of having a topic that was so broad, but not knowing how to reduce the results with the proper keywords which is the major problem I ran into. I didn’t know how to reduce the amount of results I was getting back since a majority of them were advertisements without using the word “fire”. So after further discussion, I decided to change where I was looking in the repository. I narrowed it down to only looking in “Local and General” although there were maybe a few reports of fire in “Personal and Social” the majority of the content I was looking for was found in “Local and General”.\nIn this graph it shows the percentage of the cause of fires from 1906-1907. With a total of 19 reported fires from 1906-1907, there were 10 that were accidental, 8 that were caused from an explosion, 3 that were caused from a crime, and 3 that were caused from miscellaneous categories. With the section of explosions, the occurrences of fire were either on a boat or from mining. At the time in Egypt, there was a high demand for coal and the use of coal for the steam powered engines on the ships which explains why there were instances of explosions that would turn into a fire in the mines and on …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"f3cf9d691fc58e61c5aa8d5016a88e64","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-meyer/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-meyer/","section":"post","summary":"With Egypt being located along the Mediterranean Coast, most of their months in the summer is hot and dry in the majority of the country, and humid in the Delta.

In reality humidity could have an effect on how these Alexandrians functioned in their daily lives and caused different consequences on the city as a whole. Seemingly small things can be more impactful than as they appear on the surface. In this analysis project research was done to see how these Alexandrians could have been affected by humidity and what other consequences could have resulted due to high levels of humidity. The resource that was used to gather this information was from a microfilm version of The Egyptian Gazette. This was a British run newspaper in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 1900s when Egypt was still under British control. This means that some of the information in the newspaper could be skewed to make the British empire look better, so I chose to go with something that would be unbiased. In the newspaper there is a section called The Daily Weather Report which presents much information about the weather that the Alexandrians experienced on each day. The Daily Weather Report was found a page 2 in many of the editions of the newspaper. This was the main source of information used for the analysis project and the Xpath query I used was able to pull all of the data for humidity for each of these days in order to help further my work on the project. The Xpath query done in Oxygen XML editor was //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr01\u0026#34;]/row[6]cell[2]/measure[text()] and it yielded 149 items which is a sufficient amount of data that could be analyzed and allow me to draw conclusions. Through conversations with class members I was able to find out more interesting facts about humidity. My classmates helped me to become more aware of the health effects of humidity on the human body, so I used their knowledge to investigate on the web. The information found in The Daily Weather Report was useful to Alexandrians in the past, but now it is also useful for todays weather experts in order to compare it to the present to see changes in climate and also to see what kind of health conditions these Alexandrians may have been experiencing.\nWhen trying to decide what to write about for the analysis project humidity was something that came to mind for me because it seems very relevant when studying microhistory to study something that many others would consider such a minor detail to observe, but is very interesting and thought provoking to fellow microhistorical researchers. Weather is fascinating to me so I figured it would be best to pick one aspect of weather to focus on in order to keep in tune with microhistory and what it studies. Microhistory studies small and miniscule things in order to bring everything back together and form a big picture about the past that can help gain much more understanding about how the world used to function and how the world has changed since that time. When looking at recorded health records at the time researchers can see at what times sickness was more prominent in Alexandria, Egypt and compare that to the humidity levels at that time of year. With this correlation now known it can be assumed that during the times when people were sick or suffered bad symptoms it could have affected Alexandrians workload. In order to further revise and improve what I have proposed I would have to try and make sure that all of the data inputted was recorded correctly in order to make sure that this information is reliable enough to make assumptions about past times.\nWhen beginning my study into the humidity levels in Alexandria, Egypt I wanted to make sure that I would be able to find research on a topic in order to be able to apply what I found. I was able to find much information on medical websites to explain what high and low levels of humidity can do to the human body. Information about past humidity levels in Alexandria is important because it is important to see how the humidity levels have changed overtime in comparison to now because keeping track of climate is vital for future generations to come. The climate regulates how much work can be done and the health of the citizens in a specific area, while also regulating people’s moods and emotions. All of this information correlates together by deciding how productive a society can be at all times. Researchers all over the world try to further improve their knowledge on climate so that they can apply it to the society they are studying. Some of these studies reveal many results since their research may study outliers in the climate that they are studying, while many may not reveal much new information at all since what they are studying is too similar to recognize any drastic change showing results.

The Egyptian Gazette from the early 1900s provided daily weather reports in their weekly issues. This newspaper also referenced the many ways the population escaped from the dreadful summer months. Although Alexandria is still a highly populated city, the booming city from the early 1900s was filled with many immigrants. Even though Alexandria is close to the Mediterranean Sea, the western desert provides much of that dry heat to Alexandria. Many citizens escaped the heat by going somewhere cool back in Europe.\nThe heat gave the residents no relief, even at night. Without modern day technology how did the residents survive? We may also ask ourselves now, was the temperature a factor in activities in Egypt? If an average spring day in Alexandria hit a temperature of 29 degrees Celsius (84* Fahrenheit) in the shade, how hot did it actually get?\nThe Daily Weather Report from the Egyptian Gazette highlighted the different observed temperatures and conditions throughout different locations around Egypt. The Daily Weather Report also recorded the moon phases and other station’s conditions. All these values are published in the Egyptian Gazette once or twice a week. To extract all of Alexandria’s temperatures, I searched through working sets and got the query: //table[@xml:id=“AlexandriaWeather”]/row[contains(.,‘Max’)]/cell[3]/measure to get 1905 daily max. temperatures from Alexandria’s observations.![Max. temperatures from 1905].\nThen I did the query //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr01\u0026#34;]/row[contains(.,\u0026#39;Max\u0026#39;)]/cell[3]/measure/text() to get the data from 1906 and 1907, since it used a different template.\nThis query helped me draw a relationship between the weather temperatures were livable conditions to survive without the technology we have now. The graph I produced from the query shows recorded temperatures around Alexandria. Alexandria’s average temperature mean was 25.81* Celsius or 78.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The coldest temperature is even higher than the average temperature for Earth (57*). These temperatures demonstrate that the climate was much warmer than many other habitable places in the world.\nThe seasons in Egypt are quite minimal. Alexandria is close to the coast so they tend to have a higher humidity than the surrounding desert. Since it is hot all year around, and many people escaped the heat in the summer. Especially the British who were not used to the heat, since the UK has a maritime climate. Winter and summer align with the U.S., since Alexandria is in the northern hemisphere, but Egypt’s location is an important part of the heat they receive.\nBesides the abnormally warm temperatures, precipitation is also an important factor for the climate. Alexandria tends to have a higher amount of precipitation than the majority of Egypt, but rain has always been very minimal to around a maximum average of 200 mm a year. Although Alexandria is close to the Mediterranean sea, the water was not sufficient to drink, nor did they have the proper technology to extract the water for drinking. This means they had to transport most of their water from the Nile. Besides water, shelter is also very important for living. Homes and businesses were built from stone and clay which are materials that help keep the area cooler. Since refrigerators and air- conditioning were not yet accessible during this time, citizens probably had a harder time cooling off during the summer months. Hence, why the wealthier population tended to leave during the summer months.\nThe results I received from my data can be conclusive. The average temperature was 25.81*, while the high and low temperatures were 39* and 10.5*. This means that the temperatures were 102.2* and 50.9* in Fahrenheit, giving the average to be. A few data points were taken out of the graph due to being outliers. The first outlying point was a mistake in the Egyptian Gazette. The printed high temperature in the shade displayed on the issue from March 5th 1906, said it was 7.5*. This can only be a mistake considering below it says the low temperature was 11.3*. Therefore the point was taken out. seventy-six other values were also extracted due to the inaccuracy of duplicating the template.\nThese temperatures recorded would make it hard to live in especially within the summer months. Without proper electricity and water, Alexandria would be a hard environment to live in. Combining the results of the data with the knowledge of technology and resources, Alexandria was most likely a difficult place to live. The harsh climactic conditions could have contributed to a decline in population after the early 1900s. While many of the people who grew up in Alexandria were used to the climate, Europeans who immigrated there could have had a much harder time adjusting. Although the climate in Alexandria, Egypt was much harder to live in, it doesn’t mean it was unlivable for the early 1900s.

The specific contents of the job advertisements that I analyzed were the languages that employers wanted applicants to know, the expected gender of the applicants, and the adjectives used to describe desired applicants. In addition, I considered the amount of job advertisements that were present in different months during 1905 and 1906 to see if there were any noticeable trends.\nI used an excel sheet to organize my data into five categories. I placed job titles in column one, the date of the issue in column two, gender mentioned in the advert in column three, adjectives used in column four, and languages required in column five. Overall, I found 129 instances of job advertisements in the issues I searched. I used the Xpath query //div[@element=\u0026#34;prepaidAdvertisements\u0026#34;] to search my content folder. This brought up places where people used this element tag to describe an item or section. From there, I went through the results and put the data I needed from the job advertisements into my excel sheet. The Xpath query I used was very broad, but I had to use it because there was no way to search for specific job advertisements without yet knowing the names of different jobs. The one disadvantage of using this query is that some people might have put the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section in their file without using the element tag. That said, I decided that my results would provide a good representation of job advertisements in the Egyptian Gazette.\nHere is an example of the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section in an issue of the newspaper:\nThe first way I chose to visualize my data was with word clouds. One word cloud represents the prevalence of different types of jobs in advertisements:\nThe top three jobs advertised make up over 50% of the advertisements overall. Looking at the word cloud, the most commonly advertised job was for a clerk. In order to organize my data, I did not separate each different type of clerk into separate categories. Among the advertisements for this type of job, many were for general clerks, while others were for typing clerks and office clerks. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a clerk as someone “whose job is to keep track of records and documents for a business or office.\u0026#34; According to Robert L. Tignor in his book Modernization and British Colonial Rule in Egypt, clerical positions were normally held by people in the Coptic religious community prior to British colonial rule due to their clerical skills. This was especially true for clerical jobs in the government (Tignor 308). Such jobs became held by a wider variety of people during the period of British colonial rule. This happened because Egypt became more modernized during this time, which called for more advanced skills from those working as clerks (Tignor 308). Most of the job advertisements for clerks expected a wide variety of skills from applicants. Applicants were often expected to speak multiple languages, with some advertisements even expecting them to be fluent in five languages. The languages that seemed to be most important to employers were English and Arabic, with many advertisements mentioning that reading and writing these languages was an indispensable quality for employment.\nThe second most advertised job category was nurse. Many of the advertisements for nursing jobs mentioned that the position was specifically available to women. The word nurse was used to describe a caretaker for children in many circumstances, which is different from the common use of the word. Something interesting I found was that many families would put out advertisements to find a nurse to take care of their children for the course of a ship voyage.\nA couple of jobs were only advertised once or twice. It was very interesting to see what kind of unique jobs there were during the time period. For example, one advertisement was for a position as a draughtsman who would make plans and drawings for the government. Another was for an organist to play at a church event. The frequency of advertisements for some jobs surprised me. I only found one advertisement for a blacksmith position, and I thought that it would be a more common job during the time period.\nThis graph shows the frequency of each type of job advertised:\nAs I looked at each job advertisement, I wrote down if it mentioned a specific gender preference for applicants. I found that the majority of advertisements did not specify a gender. The only time women were mentioned in job advertisements was for nursing and child care positions. Men were mentioned for a variety of positions.\nI made a second word cloud to demonstrate adjectives used to describe what type of employee each advert was seeking:\nMany advertisements sought young applicants. The adjective with the most occurrences was experienced. None of the adjectives stood out as unique. …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"3d7f9585d137242995e5e4d592a8886b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-brown/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-brown/","section":"post","summary":"For my analysis project, I decided to analyze job advertisements in the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section of the Egyptian Gazette.

As a history major, I am constantly learning about different time periods and cultures, while desperately trying to grasp the true interests of the people living in these different time periods and cultures. So, when I saw the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section, I imagined the potential for greater understanding of what people were interested in Egypt during the early 20th century. With that being said, when it came time to analyze an aspect of “The Egyptian Gazette,” I knew immediately the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section was what I wished to know more about.\nWhen beginning my research, I first looked at the ‘Analysis Directory’ on our class website, where I noticed a student in a previous semester had already looked into the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. Since they focused primarily on 1905, I decided that I would look into 1906, and after gathering my data and making my analysis, I would compare our findings to see if public concern had shifted between the two years.\nAfter constructing my analysis question, I began formulating an XPath query. I looked to my predecessor who relied on the query, //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\u0026#39;)], and decided to use this as a preliminary search. I also searched //div [contains(., ‘LETTER TO THE EDITOR’)] to account for any differences in the way the heading may have varied between issues, as did she. However, I felt that this query was far too basic. Yes, it returned all instances of the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section within “The Egyptian Gazette” but, it did not give me much else.\nSo, I decided to build on this query and tried to pinpoint the titles of each individual letter within the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. In order to do this, I started with the XPath query //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;][@feature=\u0026#34;letters\u0026#34;]. When encoding the digital Egyptian Gazette, each student should have included the ‘@feature=“letters”’ for the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. Thus, when querying this, I was able to pinpoint the exact location of the section. Obviously this returned essentially the same results as my initial query, however, I ran it again and I added //head to the end, allowing it to pick up each individual headline within that section.\nI had quite a few results after this query, but I felt that I needed to take into consideration students different styles of coding, while keeping in mind that not everyone would make the title of the letter a headline. Therefore, I decided to then query, //div[@type =\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;][@feature=\u0026#34;letters\u0026#34;]/div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/p[1]. With this query, I was going into the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section, then into each item within each division and finally looking at the first paragraph in each division. This did not return nearly as many results as the previous query, but it served its purpose by looking for any differences in encoding which may have caused my previous query to miss a title.\nFinally, in order to procure as many titles as possible I ran my previous query again, but changed the ending to /head[1] to compare these results with my first search of the headlines in the section to again make sure that I did not miss any.\nAfter I finished gathering my data through these queries, I needed to clean up my results which I did in Atom using regular expressions. Once I had a cleaned up version of my results, I was able to cross-check the dates of the occurrences of ‘Letters to the Editor’ throughout the year of 1906 from my predecessor’s query, with the titles of the letters I had acquired with my own query. These were the number of letters I ended up with in 1906:\nUpon looking over my data it occurred to me that querying the digital Egyptian Gazette for the authors of the individual letters to the editor may be useful in determining not only who was writing, but why they were writing—i.e. what interests did they have in a particular topic. However, this immediately posed to be an almost insurmountable obstacle due to the varying ways people encoded their individual weeks of the newspaper. When querying the titles, I had a similar experience figuring out where in the code the title could be; but, the title only had a couple possible locations, while the authors had more than I could count. Every time I felt I had figured out the proper query, or queries, there was always another issue I had not accounted for. The name of the author could be located in any paragraph within the section, all depending on how many letters were in that issue and how many paragraphs the student encoding allotted those letters. The more letters there were, the more authors I needed to find.\nObviously I could have gone through every paragraph in the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section picking out each individual author but, I began to think about patterns and the way in which each author signed-off. It usually was some …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"00c1637370305cb2be8a33eafce9f8f7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-majonica/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-majonica/","section":"post","summary":"Immediately upon first glance of the Monday issue of my week in “The Egyptian Gazette,” I was intrigued by the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section.

I was interested in the topics that showed up most in the section and moreover what topics kept getting printed in the issues of the newspaper. I wanted to know throughout the newspaper what topics were, not so much being read more than the other but, reoccurring actions to be talked or read about in Egypt during the time.\nWord Cloud Photo As a result of this I decided to create a word cloud to make a visual representation of the headlines of each section of the newspaper. In the word cloud, the headlines that were printed most are the largest in the figure and then following that are the headlines that are posted less which are represented by the smaller words in the figure.\nData For this data set I created a query that would find only the headlines in the section of local and general and it would also include the date of the issue posted. I used two queries to do this because the @feature and @element tags were implemented and each contained data that I needed to combine to get accurate results. The first query used was as presented //div[@feature=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;]/div/head, the second query is different by one word //div[@element=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;]/div/head . The first query search returned 2,497 items while the second query resulted in 308 items. After this I transferred all the results into atom and refined the visual content that the search gave me. At the end I had two columns of data that was the date of the issue and the headline that was posted on that date in the “Local and General” section of the newspaper.\nComparison and Outside Sources Reading through other analysis projects from previous students, as well as the discussion of it in class, there was one that stood out to me about the Plague. As I was reading through their project they mention that their search for any div in any item would contain the word “plague” and it only returned 82 items. This search seems to have returned a small number of instances for the return of the word plague considering one of the more prominent words in my word cloud is the word “plague”. They continue to go on to explain the way the word was used and the context of the word in the multiple occurrence in the Egyptian Gazette.\nAlso in relation to my analysis search I want to reference today’s newspapers and/or ways of information in today’s society. We hardly get our information from a daily newspaper anymore, we typically get our intel from either social media or from the form of digital news still found on the internet. There is the more common way of reeling in viewers with a headline that is either a hook or a brief excerpt of what the piece entails. This differs from the way the Egyptian Gazette displayed its news. The headlines for the news paper in the section are 2 to 3 word headlines that explain the passage.\nConclusion The largest printed headline was the word “Canal” and the second most printed headline was “Suez”. There were other headlines printed that were seen quite often throughout consisting of: Alexandria, Plague, Egyptian, Stray Dogs, etc. There were often topics that were repeated in this section of the newspaper and new information was displayed this way in the Egyptian Gazette.\nBelow is a clip of the newspaper that I would find the “Local and General” section in and it is typically found on the third page of the issue. Also, to conclude this analysis project I think that the way I represented this data works much better visually than any bar graph would have been able to.\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"f9adaf80a486fd8fc38f5bed590a6c2d","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-bridges/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-bridges/","section":"post","summary":"There were many topics to chose from pertaining to the Egyptian Gazette however, in my analysis project I decided to look at the “Local and General” section of the newspaper.

I first searched a simple XPath query by searching for the word “Cromer” with the restriction of //div[not(@feature=“advert”)] to look throughout all the issues and every div except the divs with the feature of advert. I looked through the entire content repository. I found each issue that Lord Cromer had been mentioned at and put that data into the text editor, Atom. Using regular expression, I cleaned up the data to only list the dates with how many times Lord Cromer was mentioned in each issue. I then plotted the dates into a bar graph as depicted below. The bar graph accounts the dates from January 1905 to May 1907 when Lord Cromer retired and was not mentioned further.\nLooking at this data I could see that Lord Cromer is mentioned consistently with high points during the months of January 1905, August 1905, January 1906, August 1906, and April 1907. This means that he was mentioned many times during those months and few times in others. Between October 1906 and March 1907 Lord Cromer is not even mentioned at all. Throughout the latter months of his tenure as Consul General, Cromer was mentioned on average more than during the earlier years cataloged.\nLord Cromer, born Evelyn Baring, was the first Consul General of Egypt. He was given this position in September of 1883. He kept this position until May 1907 when he retired due to health reasons. He lived the rest of his life in England. During Lord Cromer’s reign over Egypt, he advocated for more British rule over the lands and dismissed the Egyptian demands for independence from Britain. Lord Cromer instituted mass reforms like the Veiled Protectorate “whereby he ruled the rulers of Egypt, with the assistance of a group of English administrators trained in India, who were placed in key positions as advisors to the Egyptian government” (Marsot). Along with governmental reforms, Lord Cromer helped institute public irrigation works and many agricultural feats that helped with the Egyptian economy and grow industrially. In 1907, a new British Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, was elected into office from the House of Commons. Campbell-Bannerman was more lenient to the Egyptians. Lord Cromer was in Britain during the time of October and March, which is why he was not mentioned at all in the Egyptian Gazette, when he found out about Campbell-Bannerman’s plans. Seeing the news and hearing of plans that would be put into place, his retirement seemed to be the best course of action. Lord Cromer’s health had been deteriorating too.\nLooking closely at the data, I noticed that many of the mentions about Lord Cromer discussed his travel across Europe. Many of the articles in January 1905 that spiked the mentions of Lord Cromer all discussed Lord Cromer’s trip across the Nile. Cromer discussed is thoughts on trade in his speeches during the trip. They discussed the prospect of Lord Cromer’s arrival back in Alexandria being delayed by a few days and social engagements Lord Cromer will come back to attend. In August 1905, an article featured titled “Lord Cromer His Life and Work.” The article discussed Lord Cromer’s personal life such as living in an old-fashioned mid-Victorian house and his professional job in Egypt. He was initially given ten years to deal with Egypt. The article specifically praises Lord Cromer’s work with irrigation that helped increase the population of Egypt. In January 1906, Lord Cromer gave a speech regarding opening a Nile-Red Sea Railway. The article praised for Lord Cromer for being a “master of English prose.” In August 1906, Lord Cromer was heavily mentioned. An article criticized Lord Cromer’s reforms and his past actions in relation to the Egyptians. In April 1907, Lord Cromer announced his resignation. As a result, he was widely discussed. His career and personal life was analyzed throughout months leading to May when he formally resigned his position. Throughout the other months Lord Cromer was mentioned a couple of times. These mentions often discussed his travel plans, his social engagements, and his actions. The only time when Lord Cromer was not discussed at all was October 1906 to March 1907. Lord Cromer was in England for an extended period of time. His health had been deteriorating and these months lead up to his resignation for health reasons. It could be that Lord Cromer was dealing with his health seriously that caused him to formally resign his position as Consul General. It is interesting that January and August were very highly discussed months for Lord Cromer. There does not seem to be a seasonal correlation between Lord Cromer’s mentions and his actions. August and January seems to be the months when big decisions and roles Lord Cromer had to fulfill had happened.\nThrough my research, I noticed that Lord Cromer was often discussed as being the “Honorable Cromer.” He was clearly thought …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"4eddbe1d67502cc647efcc9f0737ef23","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pregasen/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-pregasen/","section":"post","summary":"For my research analysis project, I looked at the number of times Lord Cromer was mentioned throughout the Egyptian Gazette.

When looking through my page images for the Egyptian Gazette, I came across something that really peaked my interest, “A Prison Wedding”. This directed my attention towards unions during the times the newspapers were published. I was curious to discover trends in marriage during this time-period to divulge whether prison marriage was a societal norm. It’s not every day in today’s society that I hear of a convict being married in secret to a prison guard’s daughter, and accusingly by the prison guard nonetheless! My goal was first to find who the Egyptian Gazette was reporting on getting married. I wanted to find whether there were trends in the demographics of those being reported on. To truly give an accurate analyzation of the demographics and marriage during the time, I felt that I must also analyze weddings and divorce. I chose those two words because they closely correlate with marriage and there could be articles discussing marriage that don’t mention the word marriage, and that mention the words wedding or divorce. So, I began by searching for each of those three key words one at a time, marriage, wedding, and divorce. The query I used to search for each word was, //div[contains(.,”keyword)]. This query gave me results on all dividers that contained the word I entered in the spot “keyword.\nUsing the basic query, there were a very high number of mentions for the word marriage (543), less than half of that for the word wedding (184), and the lowest number of mentions for divorce (58). I found that while not many articles that mentioned the word marriage used the word wedding, a large amount of the articles including the word wedding did include the word marriage. Though these two words had correlation, articles mentioning divorce rarely spoke of the words marriage or wedding.\nDue to the large number of mentions, I had to find a way to narrow down my results. The first step I took to narrow down these results and begin to analyze the demographics behind marriage in the Egyptian Gazette, was developing a typology for the articles mentioning my key words. I noticed from skimming through each of my my prior searches that my key words all seemed to appear in the same types of features. These reoccurring features included local, social, wire, notesPortSaid and the khedive. To put in to perspective what types of features my key words were being used in the most, I searched for each feature containing my keywords with the query, //div[@feature= “typefeature”]/div/p[contains(.,’keyword’)]. This query specified where I wanted to search, in my recurring features, and what I want to search for, my key words.\nWhen searching for marriage in the feature local, the query returned 11 mentions. Topics of the mentions included marriage announcements, the word being used as a reference for time (ex: “On the occasion of the marriage of his daughter”), the kidnapping of a young native girl, an obituary, a man murdering his wife for a second wife, the disappearance of a bride on her wedding day, the proprietor of “Al Moyad’s” marriage, a quote in a book announcement, a cinematograph review that included a marriage, and last but not least and my personal favorite, 11 moslem women divorcing over their husbands refusing to buy them the expensive cakes they wanted. The results showed that the most popular use of the word marriage in the local feature was for marriage announcements. In the feature social there were 5 mentions of marriage. One of these five mentions were on royalty. Other topics in this feature included marriage arrangements and marriage announcements; marriage arrangements being the most popular topic opposed to marriage announcements being the most popular in the local feature. In the feature wire there were 10 items. Nine of these ten items had to do with royal marriages and one with abolishing the church’s rights to interfere in civil marriages. When using my original query to just search for the key word I also found many results in the features khedive and notesPortSaid. After searching with the query limiting my results to specific features, I came up with no results for the keywords marriage or divorce. I also found many more mentions of my keywords in the features that I’ve discussed than what was returned. For these reasons I am leading to believe that there may be manual error in the labeling of the features. This error could alter the authenticity of my analysis.\nWhen searching for wedding in the feature local the query returned 4 items. These topic items included an obituary for the death of the “Newab Begum of Murshi-dibad”, a band of rouges that assaulted a wedding party, a missing bride, and a woman dying after getting knocked over by a horse at a wedding. In the social feature there was 1 item, the mention of a description for an Arab wedding.

As a Sports Management major, this subject is very interesting to me as I can compare how sports culture has evolved and changed throughout the years. Newspaper sections titled “Sport and Play” frequently appear throughout the issues of the Egyptian Gazette, and many popular sports and sports clubs appear throughout the years. To be clear, I can’t analyze the most popular sports in all of Egypt because the Egyptian Gazette is primarily geared towards relatively wealthy British colonists in Egypt during this period. For this reason, I will be studying the most popular sports in Egypt specifically among the wealthy British occupants of early 1900s Egypt.\nI began studying the most popular sports in the Egyptian Gazette by sampling several months of issues in the Egyptian Gazette and finding the “Sport and Play” section in each newspaper issue. I was able to narrow down the most frequently mentioned sports in Egypt by doing this. Once I had the list, I created an XPath Query for the different types of sports I had found, and compared the totals. By doing this, I found that horse racing and tennis were by far the most frequently mentioned sports throughout the repository with over 1000 results for each. Billiards and yachting were around 400, while cricket, football (soccer), and golf were just under 300. Other sports with less results included polo, swimming, rifle shooting, and rugby. However, with this method I was only able to survey the number of times these sports were mentioned throughout the entire repository including numerous types of divs. For instance, sports such as tennis, golf, and football might have been featured in more ads than horse racing because people tend to buy sports equipment frequently but they don’t buy horses or rifles as frequently. In addition, the results from conducting an XPath on the entire repository were significantly different from those found while just sampling the Sport and Play category, which was originally intended to be the basis for my serial question.\nBased on my random sample of the Sport and Play categories, the most popular sport by far seemed to be horse racing which was consistent with the larger XPath. Frequently mentioned horse racing clubs included the Helouan Sporting Club and the Khedivial Sporting Club. In the issues that I sampled, horse racing was mentioned in 26 articles. The articles described the results of various horse races, pony races, and donkey races between 1905 and 1907. These articles also described meetings scheduled by the Helouan Sporting Club and the Khedivial Sporting Club, demonstrating that readers of the Egyptian Gazette were fascinated by horse racing and looked for when the next race would occur so they could find the results. This is likely because most of the readers of the Egyptian Gazette were English colonists who probably gambled on the races as this was common at the time.\nThe second most frequently discussed sport in the Sport and Play sections between 1905 and 1907, far ahead of the other mentioned sports, was football (soccer). I was originally going to focus on football as the subject of my serial question, but I decided to widen the scope of my search and compare its popularity to the other sports played during this period of Egyptian history. From the issues of the Egyptian Gazette that I sampled, football was mentioned 14 times, 12 less than horse racing. It was difficult to determine when some of the articles were talking about rugby football and when they were discussing regular football as “football clubs” can refer to both. Football/soccer clubs such as the Royal Berks Regiment, the Port Said Football Club, the Suez E.T.C. Club, and several others were mentioned numerous times throughout the sampled issues. Though not as popular as horse racing, football was definitely a prominent sport in Egypt during the early 1900s and has remained and even become more popular across the world since this time.\nWhen looking at other background sources, I found that football seems to be the current most popular sport in Egypt, especially at the moment due to the fact that Egypt qualified for the 2018 World Cup. This is only the third time Egypt has ever qualified for the world cup and it’s also the first time they’ve done so in almost 20 years (Sky Sports). Evidently, football is a huge deal in Egypt and it was likely just as popular in the early 1900s. According to Muhammad Y. Gamal, an independent researcher of the “Arab world,” ancient Egyptians potentially played a sport similar to football. This idea is supported by ancient paintings in Egypt that show people kicking a “round object on the ground with their feet.” However, the game was never a prominent part of Egyptian society until the occupation of Egypt by the British introduced the game as we know it today.

It appears this is something distinct and special to Alexandria. As I was adding the advertisement for page 2 of the October 1906 issue. As a person that loves to learn about skin care and is addicted to by skin care products, this advertisement stood out to me. According to the advertisement, the cream derives from Icilma Natural Water, but most have named it Nature’s Skin Food. From the Icilma Natural water a cream is produced called the Icilma Flour Cream. It is described as the being a no grease or oil cream which I find amazing because most skin care products are filled with oil that, as a result, often causes the skin to produce more oil. This is especially helpful to people that have oily skin which leads them to have problematic skin. The advertisement states that it cleanses the pores of the skin and make it pearly white. I think the Icilma Flour Cream could possibly have been the modern invention of acne remedies in Alexandria during the 1900s. The Icilma Flour Cream sounds like the Neutrogena or Proactive most people preferred to use for their skin problems.\nAccording to Back to the Roots: Dermatology in Ancient Egyptian Medicine in the 2016 Journal of the German Society of Dermatology, Egyptian medicine and the treatment of acute and chronic wounds and injuries such as cosmetic procedures took an important role. Additionally, it seems that another student, Sabrina Nunez, also took a curious look into the Iclimia medicine and discovered that Stephen Armitage founded Iclima in 1989. Yet, it seems that herbal medicine was the best option remedy for the Egyptians seeming as the technology was not very advanced, according to the 2015 review journal Ancient Egyptian Medicine: A Systematic Review. However, there were instances of “miracle” cures and medicine like Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, as reported by previous student Justin Esteve. Nevertheless, the medicine used in Egypt was produced in different ways and counter products such as in mineral-based compounds, set milk, honey using tropical, oral methods, according to an Treatment Adherence and Beliefs about Medicines among Egyptian Vitiligo Patients published in Dermatologic Theraphy Journal in 2016.\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"edc11077cd925f0bf76ba739f511aeb6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-castro/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-castro/","section":"post","summary":"Alexandria very own Aloe Vera water that cures many skin problems","tags":["acne","natural","cures"],"title":"Nature's Skin Food","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ian Bolger"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"I chose to do my Analysis Project on the performances of different polo players and teams in Egypt and using different xpath queries and analysis to see who is the best polo player and the best polo team in Egypt. For this analysis, I will be searching through the editions of the 1905-1907 Egyptian Gazette and determine which of the polo players and teams in Egypt have the better performances through those years.\nWhile reading through my week of the Egyptian Gazette, which is March 5-10, 1906, I was always interested when it came to putting the ‘Sport and Play’ section together into xml formatting and I ended up reading most of the articles in that section. One of the headlines that would always seem to pop up for my week and interest me was the Cairo Polo Tournament. During the Cairo Polo Tournament and other polo games throughout the Egyptian Gazette, there are usually two games that are played on a given day and the days of the week that the Cairo Polo Tournament was being played were Monday, March 5th, Wednesday, March 7th, and Friday, March 9th, of 1906.\nPolo is a game that is played on horseback between two teams, each who use mallets with long, flexible handles to drive a wooden ball down a grass field and between to goal posts. Before reading the articles about the Cairo Polo Tournament, I was uninformed about the rules of polo and how it is played. Now, I am most informed about the sport and can understand terms that are being used in the articles about the games. Polo has aptly been called hockey on horseback. Each team usually consists of four polo players in each game and one umpire to regulate play of those games. The games are separated into four chukkers and whichever team scores the most goals at the end of the fourth chukker wins the match.\nMost historians of the sport consider that the game was first actively played as a cavalry exercise in Persia as early as the 6th century BC, migrating with conquest both east to China during the Tang Dynasty (7th century AD) and west to Byzantium, arriving in Egypt during the Ayyubid period (12th century AD). When I was reading through these articles, I wanted to know the context of these games, and which of the players and teams were really good and supposed to win and which of the players and teams weren’t as good as the other teams in the tournament. When thinking about what my analysis project should be, I immediately thought about this concept and was intrigued to find out more about the world of polo in Egypt.\nTo answer the questions that I had about polo teams and players, I composed and ran an xpath query in our main repository of the Egyptian Gazette issues that were already put into xml formatting. The xpath query that I ran to execute this task is //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#34;chukker\u0026#34;)]. I used the word “chukker” as my search word because there are many times where the word “polo” shows up without their being an actual game. Whenever the word “chukker” showed up, there was always a game that was attached to the term. After I ran the xpath query and sorted in the repository to see where the polo games were in the Egyptian Gazette, I started to read the articles that consisted of those polo games in Egypt and find out which teams played in each game, how each of the teams performed that game, as well as their players, and who ended up playing the best.\nMost of the polo matches and tournaments were found in the ‘Sport and Play’ section of the Egyptian Gazette, which was located on page five most of the time. The search for my query on the word “chukker” came back with 54 results, which was not as much as I thought it would be, but it is still enough to do analysis for this project. Most of the returning results from my query were from the first few months of 1906 and all of those results came from tournaments that were being played. The results of this query can also be hampered because of the fact that there are some issues that have not been turned into the main repository yet, or some students just didn’t correctly format when they were doing their xml coding. I think that if I had every issue from 1905-1907, correctly formatted and turned in to the main repository, I would have a lot more results for my query and more games that I can use for evaluation to see who ends up being the best polo player and team in Egypt.\nAfter going through my results, I put together a bar graph showing the number of goals that were scored per game in all of the polo games combined by each of the teams that played, along with players that scored those goals each game. Out of the five teams that played polo in Egypt during this time, the Tourists is the team leading this category, scoring 4 goals per game. The player that had the most goals per game was Captain Stockwell, who averaged 1.5 goals per game. Stockwell plays for the Mosquitoes, who was second in this category with 3.25 goals per game.

Microhistory for this class allowed the students to investigate the Egyptian Gazette newspaper from 1905, 1906, and 1907 and see details from our certain weeks assigned to us. The week that was given to me was the week of June 17th, 1907. After analyzing six days of this newspaper, we start to see similarities and patterns in the paper overtime. Each day has around six to eight pages and while each page is different, each page of each day has a similar format with different topics. Page one consisted mainly of ads which were pretty much uniform throughout all of the days for my week. Page two has some adds mixed with some text. The page threes are mostly text. They all start with “Local and General,” then the “Financial Crisis,” and then articles about what is happening at the time. Page four mostly consists of charts full of data, ranging from cotons to stocks and shares. Page five is more information about what was happening in their society at the moment. It has two columns of telegrams, a daily weather report, and usually a story highlighting a specific person. Page six continued with more ads along with ads that would normally go on flyers and some data. The daily weather report on page five is my main focus for this assignment.\nAfter downloading a copy of the master content from GitHub, I used it to isolate the daily weather report from the deliverables. Using the daily weather report I wanted to find out all of the inputted values for the amount of rainfall every month for every year. After retrieving the values, I could not fully complete the graph that I wanted to have consisting of months, years. The reason behind it is because some of the data consisted of “Heavy Dew” for some records rather than a number of how much rain. Because it is a text and not an exact amount, the graph could not show the amount of rain each month for each year. However, I computed a graph that shows and added amount of rainfall for the month. There are some months with no rainfall because it did not rain, and it is recorded that it did not rain that day. The day that it rained the most is undetectable because there are two entries of “Heavy Dew” which could be a larger number, we do not know.\nIn analyzing how much rainfall there was over time, after looking at the graph, we can conclude that there was only recorded rainfall for fourteen out of the thirty-six months. After going through a majority of the files to be sure that the data for the rainfall daily was correct, I also chose to read the information under the “Remarks” tab regarding the weather for that particular day. Doing this give me a look to be sure that the value entered is correct. I can determine this because if a value is recorded as no rain for that particular day, but the remarks for that day says that there was heavy pour or “dew”, then I know that the data is incorrect. While I did not read through all of them, because there are an awful lot, I read through one every other Monday. I chose to do it like this because it is easier to stick to one certain day to look at rather than switching days and getting mixed up.\nThe graph above shows the amount of rainfall from 1905 to 1907 each month. The months that have no data are crammed together and not shown because there is no recorded date for those days or months. For the graph, the average rainfall cannot be shown because all of the entered values are not all numbers so the graph can only show the amount of times that it rained every month. After working with Webber in office hours, we came to the conclusion that there was no other possible way to retrieve that data for average rainfall and that the only possible solution was to record the data for how many times it rained per month per year. Using the daily weather report data, not only rainfall for the day is shown. It also consists of direction of wind, maximum temperature, and humidity level for the day, etc.\nThis graph displays the amount of rainfall per month in hundredths of a mm. The difference between the two graphs is that this one disregards the values that say “Heavy Dew” and only focuses on the numerical values that were inputted.\nThe reason that I chose doing a graph using the data of rainfall recorded in the Egyptian Gazette for all three years is because I favor the rain. There is no special reason that has to do with my major or what I am interested in, it is simply because I enjoy the rain and I was curious to see how often it rained in Egypt during this time.\nIn order to obtain a graph of the amount of times it rained per month per year in Egypt, I first had to search in the master content folder on my hard drive. The XPath query that I used to get these results is //cell[contains(.,\u0026#34;Rainfall\u0026#34;)]//following-sibling::cell/measure.

However, from first hand experience I know the largest disruption to daily life are accidents. So when looking at the lives of people living halfway across the world over a hundred years ago I wanted to see how they handled these accidents and in what ways they were affected by them. In this analysis I will be finding the various accidents that made it into the Egyptian Gazette between the years of 1905-1906 and will compile the data based on what they were called, what type of accidents were likely to be deemed newsworthy, and to see what sort of long term impact (if any) they might have had on the city of Alexandria.\nThe first thing that I need to do however is to define what I am searching for. This is where the source came in handy, as even though it was more recent than the time period I will be analyzing it still laid out a format on analyzing accidents. According to the study, in a group of 500 young Egyptian men around 4.6% of the group experienced an accident within sometime in their lives. This is helpful in analyzing what types of accidents were most likely to make the headlines as well since the study was also able to gather the percentage of people who experienced various accidents such as motor or fights or even an electrical problem. When I say the word accident, I will be referring to both accident and any other word that was used to describe such an event. Another term I looked for when studying accidents was the word “incident,” which it turned out gave a lot of results but not the same kind of news. While articles with the title accident they focused on an event that was caused by something random or unexpected whereas incidents seemed to be used more for intentional conflicts such as on the frontiers.\nBy taking all the times that the word accident was used in just the headline for an article I was able to gather 103 results. Many of these headlines were duplicates in the Local and General section such as “Terrible Accident” or “Motor Accident.” I thus divided these titles by certain features with accidents related to vehicles categorized under “vehicles” and more general headlines like “tragic accident” under the “general section (please see the graph for Accident Reappearance for a visualization). The most interesting ones were ones that had a specific title next to them, such as those that mention the specific individual by name such as an article from the June 12th, 1905 that had the headline “Mr. Clowes in a Railway Accident” or the “Kafr Zayat Railway Accident” on June 23, 1905.\nSpeaking of the year 1905, the month of June saw a large spike in railway accidents with headlines such as the two I mentioned in the previous paragraph as well as those with the title “Cairo Express Derailed” and “Another Railway Accident.” This indicates a massive problem with the Egyptian rail system if it was a frequent enough disaster to be a cause for discussion repeatedly in the Egyptian Gazette. Another accident that got multiple articles was when the King of England ending up tearing a tendon in his leg. According to the articles (one was published on the 17th of November and another on the 18th in the year 1905) King Edward VII had ended up tearing a tendon above his ankle. The articles focused on separate issues, with the preliminary one giving the details about where the King had his accident, what he was doing, and tried to downplay what exactly happened to him while the follow-up that was issued the following day gave the specific details such as where the injury was, who was surrounding and greeting the King during his rough time, and what he plans to do since he was issued to be in no danger anymore.\nThese two articles help illustrate who was reading the Egyptian Gazette, cause while the railway accidents and other disasters that frequently made the news were never issued a follow-up (including one of the specific headlines that had a government agent named) the only one to receive one was based on a foreign king. This points the disparity between using the Egyptian Gazette as a source for the common Alexandrian people as this paper was written for an international audience in mind and focused on English events whenever they had any impact on its citizens.\nAnother term I was expecting to yield results was any headline pertaining to tragedy, however to my surprise I was only able to pull up 17 headlines containing the word. The title seemed to indicate that when it was used it was during an act that was either indefensible or an incident that had personal information on the victims. One such example was on January 4, 1905 when two men were killed by a third when they all wished to marry the sister to one of the victims. This seems to indicate that the news did not try to stir emotions as tragedy is usually implied to an act that was meant to stir up emotions.

Whether it is out of desperation, or simply for the rush of adrenaline, robbery should not be a crime that is as common as it is today. However, robbery has not only been an issue recently; as shown in multiple issues of The Egyptian Gazette from 1905 to 1906. My main purpose in this analysis is to make evident the prominence of theft in Egypt during the time period previously stated. In doing this, I will try to uncover a pattern with the robberies by analyzing when and where the theft occurred, what type of robbery it was and if the crime ended in murder.\nData Accumulation What influenced me to look into the prevalence of theft in Egypt was my assigned Monday issue. On October 29, 1906 alone, there were three news articles reporting a sort of robbery that had occurred. This made me think that there would be similar articles in other issues. However, the three news stories I had read in my issue used different wording to describe the robbery. This caused me to realize that if I wanted to get the most results possible, I would have to test multiple different keywords. Therefore, I ended up using five different keywords, which combined, gave me 51 occurrences of robbery to work with. The keywords I used each gave me a different number of results: my first search using the word “robbery” came back with 49 items, “burglary” with 152 items, “thief” with 39 items, “thieves” with 54 items, and finally, “theft” with 102 items. It was not uncommon for these keywords to overlap in an article, so I had to ensure that I was not reporting an instance in my data more than once. I decided the easiest way to collect my data was to make an Excel sheet with four columns titled date, place, type of robbery, and if the crime ended in murder or not. I created a typology for the different kinds of robbery; individual, house, business, ship, post office and train. Most of these are self-explanatory, being that a house, business, ship, post office or train robbery is one where items are being stolen from that particular setting. However, to clarify, an individual robbery is one where belongings being held on an individual are stolen. After collecting this data, I plugged it into Tableau, where I created different visuals to present my data in an aesthetically pleasing way, which is shown further in my project.\nResults Date An aspect of the robberies that I thought would be interesting to examine was the dates that they occurred. I wanted to see if there was a spike in robberies during a certain time period. However, in doing this, I had to acknowledge the fact that the digitization of The Egyptian Gazette during 1906 is not fully completed. This could be the possible explanation as to why in the line graph below, robberies decrease in 1906. However, it could be possible that this information is true and there actually was a decrease in theft in 1906 due to possibly stricter security or punishment, which could decrease the desire for people to steal. Something else that I found to be unique was the drastic decrease and then increase between August and November of 1905. It is pretty much impossible to discover the exact cause for the extremity of going from seven robberies in August, to one in October, then back to seven in November. However, a hypothesis for the reasoning behind this could be that after such a large amount of robberies in August, security became tighter, causing theft to decrease. Then once robberies decreased, people might have loosened up security because they assumed robberies were less likely to happen, triggering an increase in theft.\nPlace Another significant detail I decided to analyze about the robberies was the city in which the crimes took place. As shown in the visual, the majority of the robberies occurred in the northeast region of Egypt. There are many possible reasonings for this trend, including the fact that the capital of Egypt, Cairo, is located in the northeast. In fact, 16 of the 51 robberies took place in Cairo. Since Cairo is the capital, it can be inferred that the city was considered modernized and urban, taking in an influx of wealthy European immigrants. This could be the reason that the capital was targeted for theft. The northeast also has access to oceans, making ship ports another easy target for burglary. Thieves may have been attracted to the immigrants coming in on ships with valuable belongings, as well as materials being imported and exported through ports, like Port Said which had 3 reported robberies.\nType Something I found to be important when analyzing the trends in robberies was the type of theft that occurred. I categorized the robberies by whether it was a house, individual, business, post office, train or ship that was robbed. The two most popular types of theft out of my data are house and individual robberies, each …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"ff88a02f900c00251578aa8a2ff4af2c","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-donofrio/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-donofrio/","section":"post","summary":"Theft should be considered one of the most selfish crimes, as it is literally the act of stealing from others in order to benefit from their belongings.

A stock is a portion of company ownership that is sold to the public for which the owner of the stock receives a part of said company’s earnings. A debenture, is similar to a stock, but instead of the value of the stock rising and falling with the company’s wealth, it has a fixed rate of return.\nThe point of this project was to not only compare the stock price and debenture price of any given investment over time but also to compare both a “gilt edged” investment, meaning a strong investment, to one that may have been suffering in the oncoming financial crisis in Egypt at this time period (as explained in my blog post).\nWhat spurred this investigation were the parallels that I was seeing between the Great Recession of 2008 in the US and the articles written about the Egyptian economy in 1907. It is true that markets are cyclical and have their ups and downs. For the most part, we can see these cyclical trends coming every 10 or so years. This would mean that exactly a decade before the US market 2008, Egypt would have been feeling the sting of an economic crisis similar to that of the one the US experienced.\nWhen searching for information on the Egyptian market failures of 1907, the Panic of 1907, also called the Knickerbocker Crisis, kept appearing as a result of my searches. The Knickerbocker Crisis was a US Stock market dip that occurred in October of 1907 and the effects of this crash were not limited to the US as explained here.\nTracing the financial articles throughout the Egyptian Gazette, and as noted in my blog post, it is clear that Egypt felt their economy failing and very quickly what was a “localized” crisis began to spread:\nSoon after, the crisis was felt abroad, as seen in the article below from the introduction to a quote of a French article. Not only is the crisis officially “raging” in Egypt but is felt all over Europe (which, honestly, has the most to lose seeing as Egypt was still under European rule).\n.\nBelow is the visualization of the results from tracing the “Stocks and Shares” table in the Egyptian Gazette. The strong stock that was analyzed was The Agricultural Bank of Egypt and the stock that was supposedly losing traction in the market was the Land Bank of Egypt. This is not unlike what most consider the cause of the US Great Recession of 2008 and many other economic recessions throughout history, speculation, in particular land speculation (or in 2008 the bundling of blatantly faulty mortgages).\nFrom this visualization, it is evident, in a loose pattern, that the share and debenture prices seem to mirror each other. It seems, by this visualization, that the Land Bank of Egypt outperformed the Agricultural Bank of Egypt which is the opposite of what is expected given the information found in the financial articles of the Egyptian Gazette. As to why the debenture price of the Land Bank was so much higher in general than the other measure, I cannot say. This could be due to improper coding of the Gazette or some other underlying force at the time. To speak to the stability of the investments, the only one that seemed to be unwavering was the debenture price of the Agricultural Bank which we would expect from a “gilt edged” security. The share price of the same investment does not stay as steady but is still much more constant than the Land Bank debenture price.\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"9e005db20e795cfde6b55d4c8a4dd13e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-metallo/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-metallo/","section":"post","summary":"Expanding on my blog post “Is Egypt In a Bubble?,” I dug through the pages of the Egyptian Gazette and traced the “Stocks and Shares” table throughout 1905 and 1906 with as much data available from 1907 as well.","tags":null,"title":"Stocks and Shares","type":"post"},{"authors":["Adam Hutson"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"The Egyptian Gazette was a well-rounded newspaper containing topics varying from weather, plague, sports, and daily trade. There are so many topics covered, it was Egypt’s source of news in the early 20th century. While going through the newspaper, coding it, and reading the different stories, something stuck out to me. I was coding page four of my Monday issue when I read about a show within a small theatre in Egypt. This stimulated my interest in what shows were like in the 1900s compared to how they are now. With all the different events going on within the newspaper, there was a large emphasis on the arts, especially musical art and theatres. This was interesting to me because I was always around live shows growing up. I wanted to see how things were different over a hundred years ago in a different country than they are today as I know it. Also, I wanted to compare the theatres mentioned within the region the newspaper covered.\nGetting Acquainted There are four prominent theatres that occur throughout the newspaper from the years 1905-1907, although there are more that show up. Most of the appearances from these theatres come during our winter months (December-March), I am assuming because that is when most of the shows happened. The four theatres that show up the most are the Zizinia Theatre, Verdi Theatre, Abbas Helmy Theatre, and the Alhambra Theatre. To look more in depth to these theatres I used the query, //head[contains(., \u0026#34;THEATRE\u0026#34;)]. This searched all the headers containing the word theatre. The all caps were necessary because most of the headers coded for use all caps as the header and also used “Theatre” as a search to find the headers with lowercase letters. After gathering more and more information about what theatres were present and which ones appeared the most, I changed theatre to the different names of the specific theatre to narrow my search. The Zizinia and Alhambra theatre show up the majority of the time compared to the other two. Also, the Zizinia Theatre seems to be widely popular, and by far the most popular out of all of them based on the reporting on it. The Alhambra shows up the most number of times trhoughout the paper. The way these theatres worked was a company would rent out the theatre for a certain period of time and put on shows there. A lot of the time there were operas, but other shows range from dramas or comedies. The Verdi Theatre, for example, is a company and they rent out the Cairo Opera House to do their shows.\nLocation My first thought when reading into these different theatres was where they were located. I thought the location would give me more insight on how each one functioned, and I could draw my conclusions on the overall performance from there. To my surprise, the Zizinia Theatre, Abbas Helmy Theatre, and Alhambra Theatre are all located in Alexandria, while the Verdi Theatre location is in Cairo. Alexandria is on the coast, which means more people coming through the city such as tourists or just passing through. I think there is a greater demand for theatres in Alexandria because of this foot traffic. Cairo is also a large city in Egypt, but the demand for theatre is less there. The trend for this holds up in the actual stories of the newspaper.\nVerdi Theatre The Verdi Theatre in Cairo struggled a lot during this time period, which surprised me because of the magnificent layout the Cairo Opera House was. The Khedive at the time wanted something superior to anything else, so the building cost a fortune, but was well constructed (LePaitre 1963). However, upon deeper research in the newspaper, reading what the editors wrote on the Verdi theatre, my opinion was quickly changed. On one occasion in the newspaper, an editor was begging the people of Cairo to go watch shows there. They said the theatre was empty and the companies did not want to rent it out anymore. At one point the Verdi Theatre even went on strike because of their struggles. There is never anything of this sort about the other theatres in Alexandria.\nThe struggling of the Verdi theatre intrigued me. They struggled at the beginning of 1905, as I was going down the dates, another event was interesting.\nFire! The Abbas Helmy Theatre caught on fire in April of 1905. No one was injured, but the whole theatre was destroyed, and this caused a few things to happen. After the sudden decline of Abbas Helmy, the Alhambra Theatre received a lot more coverage from the newspaper, and I think this gave them a lot more popularity. Towards the end of the content (around April 1907) there is reporting of the Alhmabra Theatre getting an upgrade. Another cause and effect was the emergence of a new theatre, the Ezbekieh Theatre. However, this new theatre was located in Cairo. This theatre was built next to the Ezbekieh Gardens, along with another theatre next to it. The Khedive made a lot of money by renting these theatres out to various European companies (Barbour 1935).\nConsistency The most popular one, the …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"cb9a67172dda60bc9766c2776baee654","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-hutson/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-hutson/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette was a well-rounded newspaper containing topics varying from weather, plague, sports, and daily trade.

This project will include the locations of schools that make headlines in the news, including the schools that are being advertised. This will also include what months of the year education seems to be of most importance in the newspaper. I will also look for trends in the school system, such as common problems (Sailer, 1912) or modernization (Saleh, 2012). Keep in mind throughout this paper the changes that Egypt is going through during the early colonization period of 1905. Britain was occupying Egypt during this time and many other countries were represented in Egypt making Egypt a melting pot like America. Education and schools in Egypt were overall successful between 1905 and 1907 because of the new schools built, resolved conflicts, and excellent displays of intelligence from the children.\nThe first preliminary query I ran was for any div type item that contained the word school, but that resulted in too many vague answers that were repeated and not entirely relevant to my purpose. Ultimately my query boiled down to school* in any headline within the master content folder which returned 234 results. Upon first glance this information would indicate that education is something that the Egyptians took seriously in the early 1900s, but with further research, a lot of those instances of the word school in a headline were simply advertisements for those schools. These advertisements are still relevant to my project, however, because it proves that the school system itself was interested in persuading the parents that were reading this newspaper to send their children off to school through mere exposure advertising. The school that advertised the most was the Berlitz School of Languages, which offered lessons in languages such as French, German, Arabic, and others. I also noticed off the bat that there wasn’t much of a pattern in the months that schools showed up most in the newspaper. The only months that were slightly above average in displaying the word school were July and October, and I will discuss why later in the paper. This lack of dominance by any specific month proves that education was pushed evenly throughout the year, therefore represented well in Egypt throughout the whole year.\nAfter skimming through all of the results I noticed that there were certainly a lot more schools that were successful than there were schools that were failing. This was due to the increase in the number of children interested in learning and the many advertisements for schools in Egypt during this time. Even though most schools in Egypt were doing great in this time, the parents and students wanted more funding to come from the Government. The Egyptian Government, however, was pouring all of their money into different public buildings and physically building new schools because the current schools are overcrowded. There were, in fact, four schools that were either built or planned to be built between 1905 and 1907 in Egypt including the fourth secondary school and an Italian school. This progress of the school system proves that the population in Egypt was growing during this time and these people that were coming to Egypt wanted to go to school and learn which is positive for this community.\nMoving on to the schools that showed up the most in the newspaper, the Berlitz Schools of Languages showed up in the Egyptian Gazette 110 times between 1905-1907. This means that the Berlitz Schools took up almost half of my results from my query. For the most part, the Berlitz Schools were simply advertising for their individual language lessons, and the other times they showed up in the newspaper it was for an award they received for doing such a great job teaching. The reason that the Berlitz Schools advertised so often was because it occurred year-round, that is there was no start date and end date so the ads played through every month, because it was more similar to a tutoring service for those who wanted to learn a new language. This is important because it really proves that many different cultures were flooding into Egypt and it was best for people to understand and speak several languages so that they could communicate with each other. The progress of Egypt as a country was clear in population, economy, politics, and most importantly, education.\nAlthough there were a few schools that showed up many times in the paper for prestigious reasons (Berlitz, Zeitoun Blind School, several girls’ schools), there were a couple of higher education schools that gathered fame in the paper for their students’ disobedience. More specifically, in 1905 and 1906 the Polytechnic school and the Khedivial Law school students went on strike against the administration. It was the Polytechnic schools that went on strike first in 1905 because the students were simply unhappy with the way the school was run, but the strike was short lived after the administration threatened the …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"da51a8ed5793b11dc669a0bb7644726e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-clark/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-clark/","section":"post","summary":"I will explore the Egyptian education system in the early 1900s.

The source of our curiosity stems from a trait of human species call neoteny, according to Tom Stafford of BBC. This trait means that we as a species are more childlike than other mammals and tend to want to explore, whether it be physically or mentally. This trait could explain why the stories about death and murder seem to be some of the most popular articles in the Egyptian Gazette.\nSince death is such a popular topic among readers, the newspaper probably liked and even encouraged articles and advertisements to write about it because it would please the readers, which in turn would result in more people reading meaning more money for the company. There is a common advertisement found in almost every day’s issue which is titled “The Egyptian Gazette” and is the subscriptions and advertisements article which has information on prices. One of the topics suggested in the advertisement sections is “death” showing how popular and common it was to find articles about it throughout the newspaper. The idea of death is almost a form of entertainment for humans. We love to know how the person died, where it occurred, and if it was a murder, who did it and what motivated them to do so. Criminal forensic psychologist Paul G. Mattiuzzi talks about this concept in his article, saying, “In the real world, there is in fact a practical duty we share in understanding the means and the motivations for crime. Understanding is necessary for prediction, prevention and protection. But the popular fascination with homicide goes far beyond the practical. The story lines are a staple of art and literature and a subject for both drama and comedy. The murder mystery is often most compelling when it abandons reality and is framed in fantasy.” When reading stories about death and murder it is our natural instinct to put ourselves in that position, either the person who was killed, or the person who did the killing. We want to know as much information as we can get our hands on and putting ourselves in those positions allows us to see the different sides. By doing this we begin to think about if faced with a murderer the possibility of escaping or fighting back. Or vice versa think about if you would be capable of committing such a horrendous crime based on the motives.\nThe subject of death and how frequently it appeared in the newspaper peaked my interest and prompted me to focus my paper on death throughout Alexandria. Although there have been similar topics, I will be looking at death with a more broad perspective. For my query I chose a fairly simple one to run. At first I tried using the query //div[@n=\u0026#39;4\u0026#39;]//div[contains(., \u0026#39;death\u0026#39;)]/head to try to get a fairly large pool of data from page four of the different issues containing the word death because page four usually contains the telegrams which sometimes contain news of an important person’s death or an interesting death such as murder. It also usually has a few articles on the page which also sometimes contain a story about a death or several deaths, but this resulted in only 48 results which was too few to work with and resulted in such a broad range of items that would be difficult to work with and get the best results possible.\nAfter this failed attempt I settled on a more simple query to ensure that I got a large sample of data to work with. The query I used was //div/p[contains (., \u0026#39;death\u0026#39;)]. This looked in each paragraph within a div and found any item that had the word “death” inside. It resulted in 953 items from which I took the dates from each time it occurred and made a frequency graph to find which months the most deaths occurred. From this data I came up with this graph.\nFrom these results we see that the months with the highest death rates are June through September for both the years 1905 and 1906. The highest deaths total was in September 1906 with 68 deaths. This isn’t a huge surprise because there is usually a high birth and death rate during the month of September, even to this day. These results show that this window in time is quite possibly a sick season and the reason for the high amount of deaths could be from an easily contracted and spread illness. There’s a possibility that since this time is around the holiday season that families could be together and there could be tension among relatives that could possibly result in murder, or it is also a high stress time which could cause heart attacks and other natural causes of death. These are just assumptions and the sickness theory is the only trend to be easily identified because death is hard to predict and can be caused by many factors. With this in mind I wanted to find what some of the main causes of death were. To do this I used the same query but …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"2c114ebbba13246326c32903600ace04","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/","section":"post","summary":"Humans have a natural sense of curiosity about them, and this curiosity can be innocent such as the fascination with a person they’ll never meet and instead reading stories about them, but it can also be darker and the focus can be on murder and torture.","tags":null,"title":"The fascination with death","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tiffany Medina"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":" Introduction The Egyptian Gazette delves into detail about the plague and its various forms. The cattle and bubonic plague both created epidemics in Egypt especially from 1905 through 1907. The spread of the bubonic plague swept through Egypt during the early 1900s. Regions across the nation including districts of farms, small towns, hubs, and port cities were all infected by the mass illness. The epidemic did not only hurt the well-being of residents of Egypt, but it resulted in a change in agriculture, markets, the economy, and the habits of everyday life for the residents of Egypt.\nGathering Data The frequent articles under the “Local and General” section prompted me to discuss and analyze the different plagues in Egypt and how they correlate, if a correlation does exist. I began this analysis by first narrowing down the searches of the plague into a reasonable number of returns to search through. The query I used, //div[@element=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;]/div[contains(.,\u0026#34;plague\u0026#34;)], searched through the Local and General section of the Egyptian Gazette for the keyword “plague”. This search came up with 133 results. I then organized these searches into three categories based on the most frequent words that came before the plague using the regular expression search of “\\w+ plague”. The most frequent words used before the plague were the words “the”, “bubonic”, and “cattle” along with other variations of words that can be found in this word cloud.\nWhile searching through the variations of word combinations with the plague, I noticed many of the results came from the same articles that used the word “plague” multiple times. Therefore, I changed my xpath query to //div[@element=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;]/div[contains(.,\u0026#34;plague\u0026#34;)]/head to search only in the headings of the “Local and General” section. This search resulted in 47 queries with 31 results being “the plague”, 9 results being “cattle plague”, and 7 results being “bubonic plague”. From these headings, I was able to get a better understanding of the frequencies and dates of both plagues.\nBackground The bubonic plague epidemic began in the early 1900s with a sweeping illness that resulted in 843 cases of the plague in 1904 and 501 deaths as a result. Throughout Egypt, methods of preventing the plague and its spread began to arise to prevent further fatalities and sicknesses that occurred as a result of the plague. The most prominent reason why the plague was being so quickly and widely spread was because of the strong trading business that occurred in Egypt during the early 1900s. Top locations that showed the highest fatality and contractions of the bubonic plague typically incorporated port cities of Egypt and large hubs. Alexandria, Suez, and Port Said were some of the main cities that had the highest records of the bubonic plague in Egypt. As a result, beginning in 1905, cases of the bubonic plague struck Egypt and its citizens through contractions from other nations. The bubonic plague became a record-breaking epidemic in Egypt. The average rate of contracted illnesses that were a result of the plague was approximately 7 per week and approximately 4 deaths per week from the plague. Nations and regions including India and Upper Egypt have spread the disease through merchants and traded goods between the two locations. As distinguished by Sir H. Pinching and Dr. Cresswell the “infection conveyed …. had been infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt”. Through the use and distribution of these goods the plague impacted many civilians such as one case in January of 1905 that caused the illness of fifteen people and three deaths caused by the bubonic plague. This resulted in a search and cleaning of multiple ships and shipments that may have been affected by the plague. Many ships were seized if they were found to have traces of the plague and taken into quarantine. The search and seizure of many ships that had goods that were impacted the plague also resulted in different maritime procedures and a delay in times for the passages of ships – resulting in delayed voyages and arrival of traded goods.\nIn addition to the bubonic plague, another form of plague quickly spread across Egypt as well. The cattle plague came across Egypt from Sudan and infected the cattle of Egypt and the produce market as well. The outbreak first came across Sudan and then impacted Egypt through imports from Sudan. The epidemic only affects cattle and cows directly and causes the death of these animals in large quantities. However, the cattle plague does affect humans indirectly also. The lack of cows leads to a lack of products that result from cattle causing a shift in the Egypt economy, market, and dietary habits of the people of Egypt. The cattle plague also affects the residents of Egypt since the consumption of milk and other products that originate from cattle may result in illnesses to the individual who has digested it. Although the cattle plague was still a significant epidemic in …","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"48235e080323d3bd71d5fc693ca4970b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-medina/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-medina/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction The Egyptian Gazette delves into detail about the plague and its various forms.

Typically, these events consist of many different activities including people going to the theatre, listening to the orchestra, or dressing up to attend glamorous galas. I noticed that in the Coming of Events Calendar there were many reoccurring theatre names. I decided to research the different types, and the most reoccurring theatres in Alexandria between 1905-1907.\nIn order to locate the different types of theatres within Alexandria, I ran an XPath query searching in element of the Coming of Events element. I received about a little more than hundred. I also used the regular expression to search anything with the word theatre within the template. In my original XPath I searched through the whole content file, but I realized that I did not have it updated. This caused my search to include the element tag instead. As a result, I had to update my content folder and then began my XPath search again. I received a little less than my original XPath search, but I copied my work and placed it into an atom document. I also used regular expression to be more specific with my search and took at all the mentions of theatre within the Calendar of Events. My XPath query result then was the following: //div[@feature=\u0026#34;comingEvents\u0026#34;] with regular expression \\w+ theatre.\nOnce in atom, I deleted everything that was not labeled or named theatre. I realized that there were a couple of misspellings and I corrected them. Overall, nine theatres were constantly contracted and used for different events. These theatres including the following: Esbekieh, Eden, Theatre des Nouveautes, Alhambra, Esbekieh Garden, San Stefano, Zizina, and Abbas. Based on the four most mentioned theatres in Alexandria, I decided to do another XPath search. I wanted to understand the different importances of these reoccurring theatres, and I began to research the number one theatre, the Esbekieh Garden theatre. Then, I continued my search by exercising multiple Xpath searches by using the Calendar of Coming Events tag and placing the specific name of each theatre from my original search. Although it was difficult because the Calendar of Coming Events has a specific template, I excluded the items that did not have a description following. However, I did keep the theatres which had the type performance such as Italian comedy or French comedy. Initially, I only had a couple of theatres under the year 1905, but after searching through each individual theatre more results were gathered for that year. As I gathered my results in a tableu worksheet, I discovered that most shows were seasonal. Most of the theatres occurred during the fall beginning in August and ending in January or February. My data ranged from the year 1905 to 1907, but the majority of my results were within the first two years possibly because most of the class encoded their issues from 1905 and 1906.\nAccording to the novel Egypt and How to See it written by Lamplough, the Ezbekieh Gardens was a small threatre, where during small intervals of time small French plays performed for the Egyptian people. The author also recognized another one of the reoccurring theatres in my XPath query search named the Abbas Theatre. It is clear that Egypt held a vast majority of culture such as French and Islam. These types of evidence can be seen throughout the Egyptian Gazette; for example, the Notes de Critique, which are often written in French. However, in the Abbas Theatre, they shared many different cultures, as well. According to Lamplough’s novel, the Abbas Theatre held many Italian opera, grand, and light, and French opera. It is stated that these French and Italian operas were very successful and held nearly twelve hundred people, and the author even mentioned that the seats were quite comfortable adding to the Abbas Theatre’s attraction. This is understandable because Egypt did not have particular demographic. In fact, during the 20th century, the population of Egypt included Jewish, Islamic, and other races and cultures.\nAfter reviewing all the different types of theatres, it appeared that most of them held different types of appeals either comedy or drama. Additionally, according to the essay “Theatre in Egypt Before and After the Revolution,” Egypt transformed due to the rise of independent theatre at the beginning of 1990s. As a result, my XPath search indicated that within the first couple of years of the 20th century the threatres in Egypt were very prominent. Furthermore, the author of the article Joseph Fahim states that the “modern” theatre we know today had its roots in the folk traditions and streets of Egypt. In fact, the theatre began to boom in the 20th century when Egypt became the cultural hub of the Middle East. I can tell from the articles that Egypt and its cultural society held an important impact both culturally and socially.

I took notice of the date these weddings were happening, and if orange blossoms were used. I did research that showed during the 1900s orange blossoms and myrtle flowers were very popular in royal weddings.\nTopic Looking through issues of the Egyptian Gazette, I found many features about weddings and funerals. I was interested to see if trends were popular during certain seasons during 1905 and 1906. Having a wedding announcement in the newspapers may also require a position of authority. I became interested in the trends that may also carry over to weddings outside of the Alexandria and Cairo area.\nImportance Finding information about Queen Victoria’s wedding in the mid-1800s, showed that she had a crown of orange blossoms, which started a trend into the 1900s. Royal weddings are always of interest to people reading in multiple different countries. I also found information about orange blossoms and their role into Chinese wedding celebrations. “There are few trees so prolific as the orange; it is one of the rare that blooms and bears fruit at the same time, thus becoming symbolic of fruitfulness. During the Crusades, the custom was brought from the East first to Spain, then to France, then to England in the early 1800s.”\n(Victoriana.com) Interested Wedding have always been of interest to me because they are such a happy celebration. Flowers are also one of my favorite things, I love to look at them and help my mom with the garden at home. In present times flowers are a focal point for weddings\nX-path I started by looking through the entire repository with the keywords “wedding” and “flowers”. However, these findings weren’t the most focused or helpful. I then tried using “marriage” and was able to find more articles with descriptions of the wedding ceremonies. Upon talking to Professor Hanley, we decided to also look for funeral information. I then searched for “funerals” and looked through the articles for flower arrangements. Once I found specific articles I was planning to use, I also searched for “orange blossoms” to see what results came back and see if they corresponded to articles I had already found.\nProcess While doing x-path queries it was fairly simple as far as finding articles, and then narrowing down my results. When first using the term “marriage” there are over six hundred results, however upon looking through them it is easy to see they don’t fit the article type I need. Some of these articles simply talk about advertising for marriages, deaths or illnesses, and other simply say that a marriage occurred. Using “wedding” narrowed the result to one hundred and forty-three articles, which offers a lot better descriptions on the ceremony and decorations. “Orange Blossoms” brought back ten results that were the most helpful in this analysis project. On the opposite side, “funeral” brought up a fair amount of results, two hundred twenty-four, which had a mix of good and bad articles. Again, some simply talked about funeral advertisement space, and others gave information about services. The search that gave the most confusing results, was “flowers” this is such a common word that it comes up in battles, market shops, and as names. I decided to specifically look at orange blossoms instead of the generic flower.\nResults/Difficulty I found over one hundred results for both weddings and funerals. Some of these instances had the flowers specifically named or how they were arranged, but the majority didn’t mention either.\nConclusion There was not any direct correlations between the date of the weddings and if they had orange blossoms.\nQuotes “One remarkably consistent usage was the symbolic meaning of “Chastity” attached to orange blossoms.

The data is given in a form containing the date and desired data of the pages assessed.\nFigure 1\nPurpose The purpose of this research is to analyze records of messages - asked by the people whom inhabited the area - to be sent to Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and London. The information will be displayed in various forms throughout the paper and will be analyzed in relation to events occurring around the time, more so understanding the actions that would have occurred in Alexandria/ Cairo from 1905 to 1907.\nDuring the 1905 time, the British Occupation Army began to become more so relaxed in Alexandria causing the citizens to feel slightly lied to as they continued to show their authority over the people of Egypt by making decisions regarding their land and relationships. The data collected showed two areas that sent the messages to the other areas of the world. The first location was referred to as “The Company’s Office H.M.” The slight variation regarding period of time for messages sent from this group likely means that it had been used by more private companies/ industries. The other location was “The Postal Telegraph Office H.M.” A company that seemed to send messages from the citizens of Alexandria as well as the British Occupation Army Soldiers and Officials. Each of the locations seemed to be used by different members of the area due to the different amounts of time that it would take for each to send messages to the cities.\nRecords of Telecommunication during 1905 seemed to be healthy, likely being used by some citizens and soldiers – whom knew people in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and London. A similar period of time for messages had been sent during that year in relation to other years. Though, the times were different for each year’s month, the same areas received the fastest messages. The country of London has been observed to have the most messages being sent in every month of every year (other than February 1907). This large period of time for messages recorded information being sent to a city shows the population of the army, which would have likely lived in the differing locations with the United Kingdom.\nThe leaders of the British Army in Egypt and the soldiers they were with during the time would do messages sent to London. Many messages were likely sent in the years during which the Egyptians would have noticed they were not going to leave peacefully without being confronted about the problem. As stated by Stephan Luscombe, “as the Suez Canal continued to grow in importance… the conviction grew that the British had no intention of leaving.” This seems to be rather true in relation to the plans made with France, causing the Northern area of Africa to be Great Britain’s Share and the lack of Egyptian members of the parts of the government, which made important decisions for Egypt and its people. The “temporary” guests from a foreign land were already sowing the seeds of anger in the land of Egypt. The action resembles someone asking to stay in your home, but then sleeping with your husband/ wife. Their actions were clear, to establish complete control over Egypt’s government then its people; the next event which occurred showed this to be true.\nWhile assessing the data, the highest amount of time for messages were sent to each of the areas directly before and after June 1906. The month seemed to be the period of great unrest and interest for the people of Cairo. After assessing the information, I began to perform some research on the time. The day of June 12, 1906 (Figure 1) was the day of the Denshawai, soldier incident; there have been several iterations of the story told about the event since the time of its occurrence. A general summation would be some soldiers came back from the hunting pigeons and met a crowd of citizens who needed the birds for food, there was a fight and then a woman had been shot by a soldier causing the citizens to become more upset and on soldier was injured and left the group of soldiers. He later died due to exposure from the sun during his attempt to return to the camping ground, he was found next to a citizen whom had been attempting to help him. The man was thought to have killed him and was beaten by another group of soldiers, fifty other members from the group of citizens were then judged and had received punishments for their acts. Two people were sent to death and the others …","date":1522627200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522627200,"objectID":"783d216f1939f579aedd9bbd45503108","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pierre/","publishdate":"2018-04-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-analysis-pierre/","section":"post","summary":"My research topic is communication and travel in Alexandria/ Cairo, through means of Telegraphs.\nMethod //div//head[contains(.,\"EASTERN TELEGRAPH CO.

As Michael B. Miller said in his book, Europe and the Maritime World: A Twentieth Century History, that “commercial maritime world helped to shape the modern world’s organization of consumption and production”. The topic of how shipping works and how it affected the world then is in reality, a study of how our world has came to be. The world economy is driven in part by the movement of goods across large bodies of water. The twentieth century was no different as this is when shipping people and goods became something that a middle class person could do. As someone with a minor in geography, how people interact with others on a global scale is of great interest to me. When I learned we would be doing a project such as this in the class I knew I wanted to do something with the globalization of trade. This is the era of the steamship, as shown by the plethora of ads showing off the prices of travel. The steamship revolutionized global trade as it opened up new trade routes that were previously unavailable due to wind patterns. As it is quite obvious how important these steamers are, that raises new questions. Where are these ships going and when? What is on these ships, people or cargo, or both? Did the proportion of ships with humans versus cargo change throughout the years? What about the overall volume of ships going back and forth, did that change? These questions are the ones that this analysis seeks to answer. This is a history class, in part at least, and this microhistory blends well into the overall fabric of industrialization of the twentieth century. Each ship makes up a tiny story in the sea of history (pun intended).\nBackground Information In order to get this raw data in the first place, my fellow classmates had to use Microfilm which possessed the Egyptian Gazette on it. We all collectively have scanned this newspaper using microfilm machines, specifically the ScanPro 2000. A very tedious process begun after scanning this pages, because it was necessary to split the page into fourths in order to get better image quality. You then had to stitch up these fourths into one image again so that you could finally OCR (program that allows you to scan an image and convert it into text). This is the graft that a microhistorian has to do in order to get the historical information.\nSerial Question All of the questions listed above are relatively specific, considering the scope of the source material. This topic though can be pulled back a bit to find something that can be applied more generally. My goal is to learn how shipping from and to Egypt changed over the three year period in which the Egyptian Gazette is available for research. Unfortunately the findings of this study can’t be too intensely generalized to the shipping world in general because of the scope of the Egyptian Gazette. In light of all of this, I arrived at the question of “What is the usage and frequency change in shipping in 1905-1097 Egypt as represented by the Egyptian Gazette?”.\nXPATH Query In order to search the full contents of the Egyptian Gazette, a Xpath query had to be formulated. This allowed the total contents of the newspaper to be searched in its entirety from 1905 to 1907. This XML search needs two things to be successful, a where and what.\nWhat The “what” was relatively easy, find anything to do with ships right? No, because that gets every ad and listing in the paper, which there are many. The search needed to be refined, so the “what” changed to “shipping” instead of “ship”. This still wasn’t good enough to be used in any substantial way. Finally the solution was found, the xml id for a section of the paper called “shipping movements”.\nWhere The xml id of shipping movements made the where easy, I just then needed to get the content out of the division. This was done by searching for every paragraph inside of the feature “shipping movements” by using the query of //div[@feature=\u0026#34;steamerMovements\u0026#34;]//p. I collected the data after updating the working sets to the most current pages. This was done on Wednesday, March 28th.\nChallenges Not all of the sections that were pulled for research were OCR’d correctly so they had to be either corrected by hand if they could be figured out what they were supposed to say, or they had to be deleted if they were too poor to even guess. Often times place names, one of the essential parts of the question, were incomplete or misspelled. There would be awkward spacing or formatting issues, as well as sometimes where the section would be the same for a couple days, showing that a person most likely copy and pasted the same template from either their own issue or from someone else for several days and didn’t bother to change the values and content to reflect what the their specific issue said.

Fact. They will experience ups and downs. Fact.\nBased on the headlines of “Financial Crisis” glaring from the pages of the “Egyptian Gazette”, it is safe to assume that Egypt will be heading for an economical decline. As 1907 progresses, the financial situation in Egypt seems to be falling to great depths, and fast.\nIn the May 5, 1907 edition of the “Egyptian Gazette” claims were made that the downturn was only impacting Cairo and Alexandria, it was “only confined to Alexandria and Cairo.” The positivity, as seen in the article below from May 1907, was meant to keep the entire country from panicking, preventing a self-fulfilling prophecy of a complete market collapse.\nBy June of 1907, only one month later, the country began to feel the effects of the crisis spreading further from the localized markets of Cairo and Alexandria. Banks began to suffer, stock prices began to drop, and the country was searching for an answer.\nThe image below is a screenshot from June 1907. It is now apparent that something needs to be done to solve the slipping economy. The Alexandria Stock and Shareholders Association brought it upon themselves to attempt to curb the fall by creating a deputation and appointing Sir Eldon Gorst as their deputy to lead them in their efforts. Gorst was the controller of taxes and undersecretary of finances in Britain and was sent to Egypt to work along side Egyptian financial officials to fix their inevitable market meltdown. He was also tasked with promoting native Egyptian responsibility in government positions (this did not happen and he would become hated by the old British rulers in Egypt and distrusted by Egyptain officials).\nSoon after, in the June 19, 1907 issue of the paper, the crisis was felt abroad, as seen in the article below from the introduction to a quote of a French article. Not only is the crisis officially “raging” in Egypt but is felt all over Europe (which, honestly, has the most to lose seeing as Egypt was still under European rule).\n","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"30d00c96bc6c707a7e6c0c2f8e7a5079","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-metallo/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-metallo/","section":"post","summary":"Bursting Egypt's Bubble...

However, the woman simply fell unconscious and did not die. This story has a theme similar to Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet pertaining to the story of a spouse thinking his partner is dead and consequentially killing himself because of that thought. It also shows that people would do anything for love, and that people act irrationally when they are put in desperate situations.\nAlso, domestic violence was not uncommon, as shown in Matthew Cooper’s blog post.

As I venture into another day of my week in January of 1907, I have become accustomed with its format, easily pulling code from other parts of the paper I, and my classmates, have already worked on.\nMy favorite part of the paper is the advertisement section. No hassle of OCR, lots of pictures, and its sheer simplicity makes me feel like an encoding wiz. And when I was working on my Thursday issue, I imagined myself reading “The Egyptian Gazette” in Alexandria.\nThis was surprisingly simple for me, to read the newspaper as if I always had, as I even began to memorize the advertisements in the same way people living in Alexandria probably did, knowing their location and contents by heart. Interestingly enough, the most common advertisements seemed to be for travel, focused on both steamship movements and hotels. However, I did not really enjoy reading these advertisements, and even worse were the ones relating to finance or insurance. My favorite by far were the advertisements related to health. These advertisements were less common, but they were unique, scattered throughout the paper making me feel as if I was on a scavenger hunt in search of the next one. They are the complete opposite of the steamship and hotel advertisements that overwhelm the first, second, and last page of the paper. I actually wanted to read the health advertisements because who isn’t intrigued by the idea of something that can make one feel or look better?\nEach and every time I see an advertisement for Peruna, a medicine advertised for women, the miracle stories about how it has changed people’s lives, as well its format and illustrations, catch my attention. Peruna’s advertisements jump off the page, unlike the steamer and hotel advertisements whose contents are seemingly stagnant and are not eye-catching at all. The Mena House Hotel advertisement is an example of their lackluster design, with its only description being that it is a “First Class Family Hotel.” Hard to say if I would stay there. The same goes for the boring advertisement for the Savoy Palace Hotel, which does not get me excited at all for it to open “shortly.”\nHow different are these advertisement tactics from that of today? Not very; the same tactics are used, especially when advertising medicine, as “success” stories continue to be attached to medicines sold in present day. Yet, in terms of travel, it is easier for hotels to excite the consumer today with vivid websites that show luxurious amenities at the click of a button.\nThus, although their contents may have shifted, people are still consumed with products that provide personal benefit, and travel, because even now commercials, computer and phone advertisements everywhere consist of these things, similarly to that of Egypt in 1907. In Alexandria it seems that just like in 2018, trying to get the daily news comes with an unexpected bombardment of advertisements that we love to hate, but hate to love.\nIf you wish to look more into advertising and its impact in present day with technology and print, check out these links below:\nThis article talks about how advertising is changing to target the consumer, which is interesting because specific advertisements from “The Egyptian Gazette” were of interest to me, and are probably of interest to you, a concept this article explores.\nThis article focuses on the idea that print advertisement is in fact not dead, but actually extremely effective because our brains work in such a way that makes us better at memorizing print advertisements over digital ones. In terms of “The Egyptian Gazette” this article highlights the effectiveness of the advertisement section to those who read the newspaper in Alexandria and how it could have bolstered consumer activity.\nThis article analyzes the changes in advertising ten years after the release of the iPhone. When looking at the advertisements in “The Egyptian Gazette” in comparison to the advertisements that we interact with in the present day, this article dissects this transition from them to now.\n","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"0f74629ed02db6d11e8ae20b2d3b6f58","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-majonica/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-majonica/","section":"post","summary":"Advertisements are a part of our everyday life, and it does not seem that much has changed since 1907 Alexandria.","tags":["advertisements","commercials","consumerism"],"title":"Advertising...

If the critics don’t like me, will the show keep running? Will I lose my job? How can I ever become a star if I have a single, bad review? Unfortunately, for performer Sig. Battani of Ernani at the Abbas Theatre, these questions may soon become a reality. This dream-crushing review becomes a reality on the third page on the Monday issue of February 18, 1907. At first, a reader may think that the critic is praising the actors for their work, as he says that “The fine old filibustering sentiment of “Ernani” seemed to please the performers, and more especially Sig. Arrighetti, who was in splendid form. Sig. Lucenti was, as ever, delightful all through.” For those actors, the fear of receiving a career-crushing review has still not come to fruition, yet.\nHowever, the review takes a turn for the worst as the critic states that “Sig. Battani is most disappointing this year to those who delighted in him during the summer.” The critic tries to lessen the blow to Sig. Battani’s self-esteem by saying that the performance may not have been as bad as the audience thought; perhaps he was sick from the weather or that his voice was changing from a lyric to strong tenor. This might be because of Sig. Battani’s reputation. Since at least May of 1905, when he was first mentioned in our portion of the Egyptian Gazette, he has received tremendous reviews. One critic even called him “the best tenor Cairo has had for years.” Unfortunately, the critic for Ernani was not so complementary, as he did not hold back when he said, “It is a pity his acting is so poor. His manipulation of the dagger (and, indeed, all the death scene) was rather absurd.” Though showing the death of a character on stage is a challenging task, unfortunately for Sig. Battani, a death scene with a dagger cannot be falsified or exaggerated if it is to be believable for the audience. As the star of the Abbas Theatre for many years, it is intriguing why his performance quality so suddenly dropped. Perhaps Sig. Battani could have redeemed himself by having more believable acting or a stronger voice throughout the rest of the performance. Alas, this is not the case. For the amount of time that Sig. Battani most likely put into developing this role and his previous theatrical successes, this review is quite a shame. Let’s hope that Sig. Battani’s future is not destroyed because of this one performance; otherwise, he will have stabbed his himself and his career in the back with his own dagger.\n","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"ac3f9eb5f63bbe8cd11d5401b3be4fa4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-northcutt/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-northcutt/","section":"post","summary":"What do critics really know?","tags":["theatre","critics","reviews"],"title":"An Actor's Nightmare","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alexis Fitzpatrick"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"For the blog post I chose an article titled “Cairo Visitor Gravely Injured” from page 3 of the Thursday December 13 1906 issue. The article talks about an accident that occurred on the P. and O. express in France the Friday before where two passengers were injured, and I believe one of them died? It’s not very clear and is not actually stated, but is implied.\nThe two passengers injured were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanna, who were visiting from Dublin. Mrs. Hanna was not seriously injured but it seems that Mr. Hanna was killed. The suspected death was caused by a piece of metal that crashed through the window. Apparently, they’re not sure how it really happened, either from a bridge or a part of the train which doesn’t really make sense because I would think if it came from the bridge it would cause more external damage versus internal like the part of the train would cause making it easier to pinpoint the cause.\nThis leads me to question just how in-depth incidents were investigated at this time. Did they just quickly glance at the scene and decide on the circumstances surrounding it, or did they thoroughly investigate and try to find the actual cause. Interestingly enough there is a similar article that was found in The London Times that follows up on the accident and says that Mr. Hanna was severely injured in the accident and died the next morning at the hospital. It gives a little bit more information about him saying he was 42 years old and was an engineer on an Indian Railway. It also says how his wife Mrs. Hannas condition has improved.

This is one of many language related events that occurred after the British took control of Egypt as an imperial power.\nIn Egypt, and Alexandria in particular, there are many different people speaking many different languages, this causes many conflicts throughout the years. This article shows that attempts were being made by the British to push their agenda ahead through the bureaucracy of Egypt and acquire power from both of the other powers competing for control of the territory.\nWhile the courts in Egypt are different than the ones we know today, European powers had already had a fair amount of influence on how the courts were set up and run. Based on this the British clearly already had a basic framework from which to build off of, and during their occupation only took further.\nHowever, despite this it still took the British many years to reach the point of where they were able to get English. This allowance and then use of English in the judicial language of the court provides us with an interesting point of reference of just how long it took for Cromer to gain a modicum of control of this part of Egyptian society.\nThis should be compared to other points of British influence to determine if the British were took a long time to get this far with only this issue or if this was a common time frame for how long it could take for an effort such as this one to come to fruition.\nSources http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2283\u0026amp;context=gjicl http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/egypt.htm https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/British-Imperialism/ ","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"7b0610b430ab8fa92e79c828dcada4ca","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-ooten/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-ooten/","section":"post","summary":"First time English is used as the judicial language.","tags":["Imperialism","Courts"],"title":"English in the Courts","type":"post"},{"authors":["Thomas Wallace"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"In the age of clickbait, tabloid papers, and fake news, it’s still nice to see that we haven’t changed a bit.

Even though it will not come for a decade, a newspaper like the Egyptian Gazette was still able to see the potential fall of the tsars. This speaks to me for several reasons.\nFor one thing, it implies that this was both a solvable issue and one that had been building for decades. In fact, one of the reasons for the fall is directly mentioned in the writing as the Egyptian Gazette states on August 9, 1906 that if the Tsar keeps the support of the army he can maintain power. We know the revolutions were as successful as they were because the army began to support the rebels and not the government. Another reason why this aspect interests me is that it shows a global interaction with large scale events, as these were not just things that happened in a bubble.

I found this article on page 3 of the Tuesday edition of January 23, 1907. I chose this article because of how interesting the topic was.\nThe article talks about how the Russian Consulate in Alexandria had reason to believe that three individuals were contemplating undergoing the task of causing harm to public security. The article explains that these three terrorists had sympathy towards the Russian revolutionary parties causing them to want to strike terror into the autocracy. The terrorists were caught due to the police receiving a warning and keeping a close eye on the small group of menacing men. The men had begun to purchase metals and chemical products that were normally used by private manufacturing companies in order to make high explosives. These suspicions were confirmed when the Captain of a Russian Steamer received a letter from the leader of the terrorist group asking the captain for 5,000 roubles to the boatswain of his vessel to be paid to the Russian Revolutionary Society of Alexandria, and if he failed to do so he would be killed and his ship destroyed. This lead to the three men being arrested and a search by the police found incriminating documents and materials for explosives. Their plan was to put the explosives in the engines of the Russian steamer. These explosives had a two-hour timer set to explode once the steamer had left port.

This article discusses how there was a surge in the production of raw cotton and how the industry of yarn weavers was able to handle this situation. In a brief statement – the weavers could not handle the overwhelming amounts of raw cotton being produced and had to cut manufacturing for a few weeks at a time.\nThis led to the up-rise of the spinning industry for cotton since the method was much more advanced and faster than the weaving method for goods. The cotton industry was being taken over by the newly found cotton industry in America causing an offset in production and quantity of raw cotton in Egypt and Lancashire at the time and in an imbalance in the financial markets. This can be known as “War Capitalism” a movement where developed nations were taking the crops and markets of smaller nations such as Egypt during this time and doubling their market. There is a great concern for how other markets such as those in America and Europe will impact the growth of the Egyptian cotton market through the West African slave trade, since cotton is Egypt’s number one crop. This led to Egypt selling off a fertile land to large estates to make every available land crops for cotton. By the 1900s, Egypt’s land was made up of 40% of cotton crops. In 1907, Egypt’s cotton crops were thriving and competing internationally with America and England with this textile.\nToday, the cotton industry is still important in America and is still increasing as one of the top textiles produced in America. In Egypt, the cotton industry is still as prosperous yet unreliable due to wavering points of success and crises in the industry.\n##Links\nWas the Panic of 1907 a Crisis?

An “enthusiast” sent in the article of the summary of this football game hoping that the Egyptian Gazette would be kind enough as to give this “enthusiast’s” article a corner of the paper.\nWhen this article was made in 1906, football was one of the the most popular sports in Egypt. Egyptians would use to gather around to watch their various clubs play, including the Egyptian national football team, almost on a daily basis. No matter what level of play it was, football was a big deal wherever it was played in Egypt. There were many other sports in Egypt, including polo, which was another popular sport in the Middle East, but football, at the time, stood out amongst all of them.\nThe match that was being played was referred to as the “Varsity match of Egypt”. It is one of the most important football matches in Egypt played between Khedivieh and Tewfikieh Schools. This was the first inter-school match played between the teams since December 28th, 1905, with Khedivieh beating Tewfikieh School two goals to one. The Khedivial and Tewfikieh Schools were two secondary schools that had a long standing rivalry in football. There were other secondary schools in Upper Egypt, including Girgeh, Ketieh, and Assouan.\nThe Tewfikieh boys won the coin toss, but ten minutes into the game, Mahmoud Ali, left wing for Khedivial, scored for the first point of the game. Then, near the end of the first half, the Khedivial centre forward, Ahmed Aly, who is the brother of the player that scored the first goal, added another point for his team to make the score two goals to love.\nThe whole second half was pretty even, as the Khedivial boys topped their rivals two goals to love. This was the 6th consecutive match that the Khedivial School have ended up as the victors.\n","date":1520208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208000,"objectID":"12ca12bd4c8d024768e661c48b267c9b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-bolger/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-bolger/","section":"post","summary":"The Khedivieh v.

The only other blog post with an explosion was larger scale, but it was done on purpose. Read more about this military-style explosion. Lamps actually exploded fairly often in 1906 because electricity was fairly new and the light bulbs must not have been built properly. Read more about the quality of light bulbs in the early 1900s. Apparently to deal with this burning train car, the best plan of attack was to detach it from the rest of the train and send villagers to put out the fire, which makes sense so as to not allow the fire to spread all around the train, but what about the people inside the car that was on fire?? This brings me to my last point of curiosity, which is certain members of the crew that helped put out the fire. According to the paper “Three Italians distinguished themselves by the coolness and the effectiveness with which they worked.” This just proves that Italians must’ve been cool all throughout history and still are to this day because I’m just imagining three big guys with slicked back hair in suits named Tony communicating wonderfully with each other and the other villagers to put out this train fire. This brings to mind a different blog post about close knit communities in Egypt, because the community of Kift must’ve been close with one another to put out this random train fire. Read more about the togetherness of the Egyptian community. The article concludes with the fact that there were no injuries in this fire, which is pretty miraculous considering the assumed lack of experience among the villagers who worked to put out the fire.\nUnfortunately, flaming trains are not a thing of the past in Egypt. In the early 2000s a train caught fire due to an illegal use of a gas stove. The passengers of this train weren’t so lucky as there were at least 373 confirmed deaths.

The letter written by Canis Major is posted in the newspaper above the Letter to the Editor – Police Dog Service. Canis Major’s letter discussed the treatment of dogs when getting closer to death. Major stated that “[he] thinks that the matter should be looked into, and something should be done, to make the life of [the] dogs, during the time they wait for death, less painful for them.” In response to Canis Major’s letter, a “Lover of Animals” commented how a friend of theirs dog suffered from a disease “contracted in the black hole of Boulac.” The animal suffered through death, and the person who responded to Canis Major’s letter wanted to make a statement agreeing with him, that dogs should be treated better in their last days and minutes. Having this section, “Letters to the Editor,” allows the public to develop their thoughts and issues about society to the newspaper. This gives them a chance to speak up. Even though, the newspaper most likely cannot put in submissions that will cause a riot, they still put in some that have a small amount of concern from the people which keeps everything well balanced.\nAfter doing another search about dogs, not animals, there were only a few articles that came up about the cruelty in their treatment. While there are other blog posts about different animals and dogs, I saw no record of any with an emphasis on the treatment of dogs during their dying stages.

What is surprising, and as an immigrant, more than a little upsetting, was reading a quoted article from “Home Counties Magasine” bemoaning the supposed death of the neighborhood of Whitechapel in East-end. The language used is frightfully familiar. “Extreme poverty is perhaps the most striking characteristic of this community…” The unnamed writer goes on to describe just how “the typical alien in his English career” establishes himself. He finds a cheap room where he sleeps with his entire family and where he “plies his trade.” Expanding his business he recruits fellow immigrants, and they “dexterously avoid the eye of the law.” Ultimately, this faceless alien creates and propagates a nasty system of poverty, crime, and misery.\nThis viciously dehumanizing view of immigrants stands in bewildering contrast to other articles the Egyptian Gazette publishes observing native Egyptians daily. There is almost a respect given to some members of the Muslim community and the next day there is an article welcoming the construction of a Mosque in London!\nIt seems that Great Britain had a history of Anti-Semitism in this era that also saw the Dreyfus affair and the proliferation of biological racism that further dehumanized non-white groups. Oscar Slater, for example, was a British Jew living in Glasgow in 1908, and like Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit, in this case the murder of a white British woman. I can only hazard a guess as to why such a heinously racist view of Jewish immigrants in Whitechapel can coexist with the apparent celebration of Muslim culture. The closest I can understand is the idea of “defensive imperialism” Historian Eric Adler in an article in the International Journal of the Classical Tradition posits that Late-Victorian/Edwardian imperialists sought to define the British empire in terms with which they could compare it to the Roman empire. Unlike the Romans, Adler posits that a popular refrain of British imperialism was that they effectively sought to “protect” themselves by expanding. As subjects of British rule, Muslim Egyptians are thus “ok” so long as they stay in their separate sphere, since they are not “intruding” into British space, unlike the Eastern European Jews that are immigrating to Whitechapel. The whole point of empire, other than enrichment, is to protect the colonial nation from the subjects of other empires when they “invade” (I cannot stress the quotation marks there enough) home. The new Eastern European Jewish community therefore turns the idea of Empire on its head.\n","date":1520121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520121600,"objectID":"6852ece26deacc12f85bd15d19bed167","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-arenas/","publishdate":"2018-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-arenas/","section":"post","summary":"Anti-Semitism and Anti-Immigrant sentiment in pre-War Britain","tags":["Racism","Immigration","Orientalism/Exoticism"],"title":"The More Things Change","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sami Squires"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"The Egyptian Gazette shows that Double executions took place in the early 1900s, especially for murder.

I am so sorry I had to be the one to break the news, but someone had to. Have you ever thought about your funeral? How you want to die? Or if you want to be buried alone? What if I told you no one in Ancient Egypt was buried alone?\nWell I am telling you that and it is true. In A.R. William’s “Packing Food for the Hereafter in Ancient Egypt” article she says “Each had spent years preparing a lavish tomb stocked with everything they might need or want in the afterlife, including food, preserved for eternity.” Your death is just as important as our life so one should be prepared for it and they did. W. St Chad Boscawen found that ancient Egyptians were buried with food. Yay, you won’t spend eternity hungry! This food was found in vases or food dishes and there is a fine collection of food from vegetable matter to bread, fish or even fresh water crustacean.\nI know what you are thinking, what if you get thirsty? Have no fear if you are lucky enough in “the temeros” where your body is placed there is a round hole in the middle that contains a drain where offering of beer or wine could be made. Your party doesn’t have to stop because you are dead. In fact in an article written by Patrick J. Kiger called “Ancient Egyptian Tombs and Death Rituals” it says “Egyptian funerals also were elaborate. The body was placed in a coffin and transported to the tomb in a cart pulled by oxen. It was accompanied by a procession that included relatives, priests and priestesses, along with dancers, and musicians.” History.com says “The original purpose of a tomb was to protect the dead and provide the deceased with a dwelling equipped with necessities for the afterlife.” I really think it was Egypt’s way to send respect and keep the party of life going.\nIs it easier now to accept the inevitable? At least you won’t be hungry.\n","date":1518912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518912000,"objectID":"8becef3a2bf995399a58b7a6dd0b23ea","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-richardson/","publishdate":"2018-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/18-blog-richardson/","section":"post","summary":"Have you ever feared that you would be hungry in the afterlife?

However, myself being an upcoming meteorologist, I look for weather in anything because, not only does it stimulate my current interests, but also engages me in other topics. In the Egyptian Gazette, there is a section found in almost all of the daily issues from 1905 to 1906 and it is called the Daily Weather Report. Here, the readers can find out the high, low, current humidity, chance of storms, etc. for their hometown as well as other surrounding cities. While this may be useful, why does it matter?\nOn the news, a meteorologist may mention the almanac or climatological data. An almanac is an annual publication containing a calendar for the coming year, such as regional weather predictions, times of sunrises and sunsets, as well as phases of the moon and tides. Something like this is still produced every year and it known for it’s accuracy. Back in 20th century Egypt, a publication like this is very important due to the fact that many people at this time were farmers. Farmers need to know when floods, sunrises, sunsets, freezes, etc. are going to place so that they can better prepare and protect their crops as to prevent shortages and starving people. Climatological data, rather than predicting the weather like the almanac, looks back at the composite or generally prevailing weather conditions of a region such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, etc. averaged over a series of 30 years. How can something like weather data from Alexandria, Egypt over only two years have an impact on something as large as the climate?\nSuppose that the climatological data for Tallahassee, FL weather from the year 2015 to 2016 just went away. If this were to happen, two of the hottest years on record would be erased. Now living in Florida would be much easier if we could just get rid of the hot days! Sadly, that is not the case. While this data may not seem that important, it actually skews the averages so it is a bit higher. While some people may not be a big fan of heat, it is significant enough that if there is a warming trend, using this data can better help meteorologists and computers to predict upcoming droughts and storms. It’s obvious now as to why this data is very important to not only historians, but also to modern day scientists.\nSometimes, people can be skeptical about scientific data, especially if it came from over 100 years ago. For instance, the instruments that they used to measure weather phenomena are most likely not as accurate as today’s. Also, the process in which they measured weather phenomena may have been different than today. Small variables such as these seem unimportant; however, these were the exact same variables that got the world’s hottest temperature ever recorded to be disqualified back in the year 2012. ‘Aziziya, Libya held this record for over 90 years before scientists re-evaluated the data recently. Not only should scientists be wary of such data while taking the readings from The Egyptian Gazette, but also should take into account possible misreadings or lack of data. Considering many students put this together, there is a large room for human and computer error, especially because not everyone is a programmer or scientist. For example, when I was using my XPath Queries, I began running into some errors because some issues of the paper, did not even contain a Daily Weather Report section. Another error that came up when I was constructing my data visualizations was the fact that some people left the default data on the table, or there was no data available. Because of this, there are some obvious errors that can be seen on the graph. To improve on this data and to get more accurate readings in the future, students should ensure that they do not leave the default text by looking it over carefully and setting aside some extra time to do so. During that extra time, the student who issues did not contain a weather report should note as such to prevent future error.\nOn a microhistory scale, weather is extremely important. Many people tend to look over microhistory because nothing big or extreme may happen over a short period of time. Weather, on the other hand, is constantly changing and can make a huge impact on a persons day to day life. I touched on this a bit in my blog post, but many citizens of Alexandria, Egypt at this time were farmers. Farmers depend on accurate weather reports and predictions so that they can plan when to protect, preserve, and harvest their crops. Something like this is especially important due to the fact the Nile River has a tendency to flood. Flooding at first may not sound good, but in Egypt, this flooding allows for river deposits to enter the soil and make the ground more fertile. If the farmers and scientist know when these floods will take place, then they can better prepare for famine by stockpiling food early.

As a result, many colonies and cities sprouted up. Historically, humans tend to colonize towards large bodies of fresh water such as rivers or lakes because it is essential for life. However, a desert doesn’t seem like a great location to live or get a good supply of fresh water. Alexandria, Egypt is one of those exceptions. On May 30th, 1906, according to their Daily Weather Reports, Alexandria received 0.05 rainfall. It started off with a change in the wind direction from East to West, and the air became very electric. Vivid lightning strikes lit up the sky as thunder came booming in and the clouds began precipitating. While it may not be much, it still rained in the desert.\nRain is not a phenomenon many people are too pleased with; however, rain brings much more benefits, especially in the desert than some may think. With rainfall, there tends to be a decrease in the high temperature, an increase in the low temperature, cool winds, as well as an increased chance of the Nile flooding in the future. While flooding certainly does not sound good for most, in Alexandria, Egypt, when the Nile floods, it fertilizes the land making it ideal for growing crops. The more floods there are, the more fertile the land is; therefore, the more food that can be grow. Maybe living in the desert is not a bad idea after all.

I had very little knowledge on this topic beforehand, not knowing that it even existed. Even though I had no knowledge of it and thought it was unimportant it seemed like a major concern the readers of the Egyptian Gazette. With this in mind I wanted to explore the question: What role did the Russian Revolution play within the lives on the readers of the Egyptian Gazette?\nTo understand and conduct this research question I had to know about the Russian Revolution. The Russian Revolution started in January of 1905 due to 4 main problems that the Russian government had. The first problem was the social structure which revolved around how land was handled amongst people. A couple of years before the revolution serfdom was ended and new laws were implemented for peasants to be able to own land. The peasants would pay small payments over a large time, but the peasants would work as a community owning the land in order to pay. The problem with this that the land was not enough for them to support themselves. Along with this problem they also had to pay taxes to government for owning land which made it incredibly difficult to live.\nAnother problem that contributed to the Russian Revolution was that the Russian economy was in a slump. The Russian government was spending too much on war supplies, the economy was importing foreign goods while not producing any agriculture to ship out and the price of grain dropped. These factors led to the along with the taxes and community payments led to anger amongst the peasants.\nThe educated class was also dissatisfied with the government. Before the revolution Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom and lifted restrictions on university. This allowed many to go into universities and express their ideas in forms that they could not achieve before due to the lack of knowledge. Due to these reforms the educated class became outspoken and started talking against the government, which led to the government putting restrictions on education. This led to anger amongst the educated class.\nThe war was between Russian Government and nobility against working class, peasants, and the lower educated class. In the end the Russian government won, but many new laws and a new constitution were set in place to appease the revolutionists.\nTo answer the question on what role did the Russian Revolution play within the lives on the readers of the Egyptian Gazette, I used an XPath query. It took many tries to get to the right results and even then, there were still problems. The main and most significant X-path query that was used is //div[@type=“item”][contains(., “Russia”) and contains(., “revolution”)]. This produced an item that contained the word “Russia” and any word that contained “revolution” such as revolutionary. I noticed that this only produced one item per page, but when reading them I notice that many times there were several more articles on the Russian revolution. Those articles didn’t use both “Russia” and” “revolution” because they already used it earlier. To solve this problem, I read each section that my query gave results for. This helped me in two ways, one it gave me a better understanding on how the newspaper reported the Russian revolution and it also helped me create better queries to help me look up certain questions I had.\nWhen I went through my query the first time I took notes on certain people, places, and things I thought were valuable. I also recorded the dates that month and year that the words “Russia” and “revolution” appeared to understand if the Russian revolution was more discussed on certain dates. This led me to create this bar graph:\nThis graph shows many things, one of which is that the Russian revolution started to be more discussed as the year went by. This makes sense logically as usually a war starts off with a big event that gets a lot of coverage and then dies down and picks up again. There are still some notable problems with the graph such as the low values in January and February, which is when the civil war started. It would reasonable that to assume that there would be coverage on this event if a war did start. There can be a few reasons why we see this trend, the first could be that the Egyptian Gazette editor did not believe that this would turn into a war, another issue could be that there is a lack of data early in year which led to the graph being misrepresented. The final possibility is that there were other, more important events happening at the turn of the year.\nTwo possible conclusion can be drawn, the first is that there is just a lack of data. The second, more revealing conclusion that helps understand how the Russian revolution affected readers of the Egyptian Gazette is that the readers were uninterested in the …","date":1493942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493942400,"objectID":"fc86a5c459d0989925d6e311074074e5","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-muniz/","publishdate":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-muniz/","section":"post","summary":"While looking through the Egyptian Gazette I found a plethora of interesting articles on varying subjects, but the most interesting articles to me were about the Russian Revolution that took place from January 1905 – July 1907.","tags":null,"title":"Russian Revolution","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jackson Boucher"],"categories":null,"content":"During the time in which the Egyptian Gazette was being produced in Alexandria, the world was dramatically different compared to today. Lifestyles and occupations in Egypt along with the rest of the world had changed. However, basic human behaviors rarely change, including our desire for money. Among the highest paying professions in the past few centuries have been banking and investing. Modern investing and stock trading traces its roots to European investing, which has existed in one form or another for over 600 years. Currently, computers and robots make billions of exchanges automatically every single day while updating employees of investing firms, large and small, in real time. Most trading is done on the New York Stock Exchange, the largest in the history of the world. Following World Wars One and Two, the United States took over a majority of stock and bond exchanges, thanks to massive infrastructure investments that allowed American traders to reach clients across the world via telephone and eventually the internet and its satellite network. However, before the United States became the super power for banking and trading, major countries (typically those with expansive colonial empires) set up stock exchanges in their capital cities that allowed citizens and firms to trade locally.\n(Images Courtesy of Investopedia.com)\nIt was then, about 200 years ago, that the London Stock Exchange was created. It only served clients locally as no reliable and quick long distance communication network existed yet. However, this changed with the invention of the telegraph, and the subsequent installation of massive, government funded underground and undersea telegraph networks that connected colonial empires with their own territories and with each other. At the stock exchanges, firms and governments were now able to serve clients in all their colonies and across the world, thanks to communication exchanges that took minutes to send and receive rather than weeks.\nNewspapers were the worldwide medium for reporting prices of stocks and bonds, and the story was no different in the British empire, including Egypt. In the Egyptian Gazette, stock and bond prices were reported daily to investors and firms who had assets around the world. It was around this time that modern trading first began to develop. But, in comparison to today’s markets, stocks and bonds were far less diverse. Most exchanges dealt with import and export markets and government issued bonds (and, in more complexity, the futures of those). Additionally, stocks and bonds in the 1900s were far less volatile. Changes were observed over weeks and months in newspapers and were usually only dramatically affected by global events like conflicts and wars or major political events. Another major difference was a lack of reliable indices, like the Dow Jones and S\u0026amp;P 500, that normal citizens could read and get an accurate idea of the general conditions of the market. Instead of an index, most people observed bond prices of major countries to get an overall idea of the other regional markets. United States bond prices gave a good idea of how well the New York Stock Exchange was doing, Germany and France for markets in Berlin and Paris, Japan for Tokyo and so on.\nThese prices were reported by each of the major exchanges across the world to show the conditions of world markets. On almost every page 4 of the Egyptian Gazette, bond prices from around the world were reported, each with the prices and type of bond listed in order. The format, as with most papers across the world, was to state the country who issued it, the interest rate when first purchased and the selling year. Selling year is the year in which the bonds were eligible to be sold and interest rates were the rate of return at the time it was purchased.\nAlthough information regarding the exact selling years and interest rates in this period of time is scarce, the interest rates and selling years serve to identify the type of bond, as only commonly purchased ones were reported in the paper. The information that is important is the prices reported with the bonds, and how they change over the course of the paper. In order to analyze the price changes, I ran XPath queries for five different bonds from important economies all around the world during the early 20th century. The five I selected were the United States, Germany, Russia, Japan and Egypt. Egypt was a selected as a standard for other countries. The goal of this investigation was determine if major events around the world affected the bond prices, indicators of overall market conditions, and to what extent.\nI began by running 5 XPath queries on stock exchange sections of the entire contents of the Digital Egyptian Gazette. Each XPath followed the same template: //table//cell[contains(.,\u0026#39;Augment.\u0026#39;\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/string(). To locate each bond within the newspaper, I replaced the term ‘Augment’ with the name of the bond (i.e United States …","date":1493856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493856000,"objectID":"7f79be06ed10d2cad5b50e37c9e3d06a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-boucher/","publishdate":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-boucher/","section":"post","summary":"During the time in which the Egyptian Gazette was being produced in Alexandria, the world was dramatically different compared to today.

In particular, the infamous Khedivial Cairo Law School strike led by graduate students was mentioned in just two issues and discontinued. Conversely other strikes were continuously reported from various sites outside of Cairo, Egypt. Points of inquiry then developed as to how often were the grievances of the Egyptian education system voiced in the Egyptian Gazette as opposed to these other strikes and what relationship, if any, might these outside strikes relate to the essence of Egypt. In order to resolve these curiosities, several queries were executed to determine the relevance, dynamics and parallelism of these movements.\nThe foremost query merely revolved around the word “strike.” This query was run in the preliminary round of research and resulted in just 63 items, the majority of which were articles written in 1905. At this point in time the content repository had hardly been updated which led to the minimal return of usable information. Nonetheless this preliminary query offered a starting point as I was able to skim through the items to identify the categories of strikes that were often reported in mostly in 1905 and some of 1906; the foremost category being strikes relating to labor, the police, and foreign powers, as well as the one example pertaining to the law school.\nThis query certainly posed a few challenges. One being that in some cases, I found that articles may have contained the misspelled versions of the word “strike” due to the lack of the utilization of OCR in some issues. Thus, the use of that query may not have included articles that presented another useful instance. Moreover, the word “strike” was often used out of context of my research, by the definition of “to come to mind unexpectedly” rather than “to protest”. For instance one article mentioned how a school curriculum may “strike” the attention of boys. This exception however was relieved by the fact that there were so little results in the initial query; reading through each item it was easy to disregard that information. Then again, when the content repository was later updated and the query was ran again, yielding more results, identifying these miscellaneous uses of the word “strike” was not as easy to distinguish.\nActual Queries:\n//div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;strike\u0026#39;)] //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;strike\u0026#39;)]//dateline //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;strike\u0026#39;)]//placename In order to return more applicable results, I then developed my query to include the words “strike” and “dateline” as well as “strike” and “place name.” With the results of these queries, I was able to determine what time of year most strikes occurred as well as what were the major locations in which these strikes took place.\nThe prominent months in which strikes occurred were November, May, October, and January, with the former being the highest. Additionally the top locations in which strikes had occurred included _London, St. Petersburg, and Paris.\nIn 1905 the Russian Revolution, a time which provoked hundreds of thousands of workers to resist, began and was the centripetal for labor strikes. According to “Moscow Workers and the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917”, the strikes really escalated the last 4 months of 1905, beginning in September with the protest against the wages, and hours in the printing industry. This could possibly be an explanation as to why the queries yielded a great number of results for September 1905 through October 1905. In addition, the Russian city St. Petersburg yielded several results from this query which is understandable considering that it is the “primacy of the national economy…holding a seat of government.” In order for wages to truly change, or for universal suffrage rights to be upheld The Situation in Russia protesters most likely would have led strikes in St. Petersburg to be a direct link to reform that would be executed by the Russian Government.\nMoreover the months of October and November witnessed the formation of several labor unions, probably explaining the increase in yielded results for the word “Strike” among these two months. The question then becomes, why are the strikes in Russia relevant or newsworthy to the readers of the Egyptian Gazette? Egypt had amicable ties to Russia, which was exemplified by the construction of the [Egyptian Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Bridge Besides) in January 1905. The success of the union strikes in Russia would more than likely yield hope for the union movements coexisting in Egypt.\nTwo other cities that also returned several results from the query were the British city of London, England (United Kingdom) and the French city of Paris, France. It is not a surprise that these two cities, in addition to Rome, and Warsaw, cities yielded the second highest results, because these are all territories of the dominating European powers, …","date":1493856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493856000,"objectID":"619a97ff9a275eaf47743edf2a4e140f","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-johnson/","publishdate":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-johnson/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette sporadically provides abstract accounts of various 20th century strikes.

Those were horrible times, but at least you didn’t lose your favorite arm like Baron London Bavastro de Cortazzi.\nIt all started over a dispute over an allegedly unpaid bill at a hotel while in the United States. He had gotten into an argument with the proprietor of the Grayson Hotel and in anger he barged out and forgot his arm in a trunk that he had left. Realizing his mistake he went into the hotel and tried to retrieve it, only to get arrested (damn Americans). Now you’re thinking that it’s only just an arm, I mean what does an arm really do, but you don’t understand how pristine this arm is. It is described by the Egyptian Gazette as “Probably no better left arm can be found in this country than the one which the Baron had. It is almost human, although it is made of papier maché, aluminium, steel and wax.” They also state the usefulness saying, “The hand of it could twirl a cigarette, write checks and carry a cane”. That is the equivalent of losing an Iphone 7! Not only does the baron have to deal with his lost arm, his arrest, but he also has to deal with being a witness to the death of one his friends.\nAlong with all of this the newspaper seems to be mocking Baron de Cortazzi, they take the upmost pleasure in using puns to describe his ordeal, “His heart is in Egypt”, “he declares that his neck has felt the heel of the oppressor”, and “through various legal complications he has nearly lost his head”. Talk about a crappy day.\nBut on a serious note who is Baron Cortazzi? Baron Cortazzi was a man who was testifying about a murder that happened to Mrs. Blanche Turner Dennis. His dad apparently owned estates in Egypt and was friends with Arlbett Sackey. His dad must have known some important people because he met Sackey through an unnamed high official in Egypt. He stated that Mrs. Blanche Turner Dennis was Sackey’s fiancée. Baron Cortazzi said that Sackey beat her once and that she may have died from that beating. No other reports could be found of Baron Cortazzi even through x-path query.\nIt is important to note that Sackey denied any role in Mrs. Dennis’ death and that someone else was accused of her murder.\n","date":1493769600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493769600,"objectID":"02a40aada25b6621ca53e3768b53fedd","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-05-03-muniz-thats-my-good-arm/","publishdate":"2017-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-05-03-muniz-thats-my-good-arm/","section":"post","summary":"A deep and intellectual discussion on the horrors of life","tags":["Arm","Baron London Bavastro de Cortazzi","Mr. Potato Head"],"title":"Hey That's My Good Arm!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jaime Sepulveda"],"categories":null,"content":" The Egyptian Gazette provides insight to the lives of people living in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 20th century. An activity of importance to these people is sports, particularly the sport of cricket, with weekly updates of game results. The 1905 home cricket season is documented in the Egyptian Gazette, which normally includes a small “Sport and Play” section usually on the third page of each Monday edition dedicated to reporting on a number of sports including cricket. A reading of this section over the 1905 editions of the Egyptian Gazette provides a description of the teams and players participating in the 1905 County Championship.\nThe League After a reading of the home cricket sections of the 1905 editions of the Egyptian Gazette, the home cricket league, which is referred to as the “County Championship”, began in the spring and ended in the fall, which the first game being documented on 27 April and the last on 1 September. There are no playoffs, the champion is simply the team with the most “points” at the end of the season. A point is gained for a win, and taken away for a loss, with ties and draws having no effect. The type of cricket played is referred to as “First-class cricket”, which means that matches last at least three days and explaining the large margin of victories, often over 200 runs. The County Championship is based in England and Wales, and is reported on in the Egyptian Gazette as entertainment for the British forces occupying Egypt during this time.\nUpon further research of the County Championship, the league had its debut season in 1890, initially with eight teams. The league is still active today in 2017, expanding to 18 teams over the years. The 1905 County Championship was the sixteenth officially organized running of the County Championship.\nThe Teams The teams are all based in England and Wales. The teams mentioned in the newspaper include: Yorkshire, Somerset, Surrey, Essex, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Gloucestershire, Middlesex, Warwickshire, Sussex, Hampshire, Derbyshire, Kent, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, and Worcestershire. A total of 16 teams. They are distributed all throughout England and Wales as shown:\nFurther research of these teams shows that Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Sussex, and Yorkshire were the original eight teams in 1890. Derbyshire, Essex, Hampshire, Leicestershire, and Warwickshire joined in 1895, and Worcestershire in 1899. Northamptonshire joined just prior to the 1905 season, so this season is their inaugural season. The previous season ended with Lancashire as the winners, so they will go into the 1905 season as the defending champions.\nThe Standings After going through each reporting of the results of the County Championship of the 1905 editions of the Egyptian Gazette, the following table of the standings can be gathered:\nDraws are referred to any game in which the game could not be played or finished, which seems to have been quite common during this time because of either weather or because of the lack of field lights to allow games to be played at night. Several games were postponed throughout the season because of rain. On 1 September, Yorkshire was crowned the champion of the 1905 County Championship, with the runners-up being Sussex and defending champions Lancashire. Scores of the games varied greatly, with the largest margin of victory being a Sussex 306 run thrashing of Kent on 22 June, and the closest game being a tie between Surrey and Kent being recorded on 17 August.\nPlayers Several mentions of notable players are occasionally made throughout the year, with sometimes the top three scoring bowlers and top three scoring batsmen being listed. This was more common during international play, in which team England would often play against team Australia. Team England was sort of an “All-Star” team of the County Championship. A recurring name was that of C.B. Fry, the star player for Sussex and had the highest average run total per game for the 1905 season. Fry, born in 1872 in London, was more than just a star cricketer; he was a politician, diplomat, academic teacher, writer, editor, and publisher. Another notable player was David Denton of Yorkshire, leading scoring batsman for the league, who won the Wisden Cricketer of the Year award for the 1905 season along with top bowler Walter Lees of Surrey, George Thompson of Northamptonshire, Joe Vine of Sussex, and Levi Wright of Derbyshire.\n","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"8c96d3b2238a36eb22abc0a7acd45b8b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-sepulveda/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-sepulveda/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette provides insight to the lives of people living in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 20th century.

As an archaeology major, I am interested how the writers of the Egyptian Gazette approached the subject of archaeology. I’m curious to see how the field was treated, and whether it was a respectable pursuit or whether ancient ruins were considered simply to be sources for obtaining collectibles that could be sold. I drafted a variety of queries but after refining my research question to focus more on the content, I found the most success in using the query //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(.,\u0026#39;KEY WORD\u0026#39;)]. This search looked through the digital gazette pages for articles with content that included my key terms. To increase my chances of amassing a more well-rounded set of data, I used a series of key search terms. Since I was looking for articles concerning archaeology, I searched for related terms such as “excavation”, “museum”, “tomb”, and “discovery”. There are a multitude of other search terms that I could have included to further expand the results of my project, however time constraints led me to narrow my exploration to these terms.\nI did encounter several issues during this first step of the research process. A significant number of articles relating to archaeology were not showing up in my results due to simple spelling errors. It appears that my classmates and previous microhistory students were fairly uninvolved with the text after running their scanned images through the OCR reader. This left the articles with an abundance of errors which made them incredibly difficult to read, and in some cases impossible to decipher. For many articles I was left with no choice other than to seek out the original image of the deliverables so that I could determine how it fit into my collection of articles. After reviewing the original source scans of several articles, I found that the word “archaeology” in itself was among the most butchered terms. In order to expand my search to include articles with even incorrect variants of “archaeology”, I used the ‘find in files’ function through Oxygen. I searched for “archaeo.+”, which effectively produced 43 results of the front end of my topic word, and completed with any variation of endings. Many of the resulting articles were simply never spell-checked, and still others were in French. For the purpose of my studies, I did not include the French language results, as I do not yet have the ability to confidently comprehend any language other than English.\nOnce I had a large pool of data, I skimmed through each article to ensure that its content pertained to archaeology. Several results from the excavation and discovery searches were unrelated, focusing rather on topics of planned construction in undeveloped areas or the oddly recurrent discovery of a body after the individual went missing. As interesting as some of these results were, they were not relevant enough to my research and so I excluded these from my final data set. As I read through my articles, I made brief notes for each text. Upon comparing my notes from all of the data, I noticed several recurring themes. As I had expected, a vast majority of the results featured an academic perspective, where the content largely commented on recent discoveries or new research being conducted in the field. There was also a noticeable amount of articles that mourned the active vandalism and passive deterioration of the ruins. Within this set of data I found another common thread of issues pertaining to funding of archaeological excavations and overall upkeep of various archaic monuments. Another cluster of articles touched on the touristic aspect of Egyptian archaeological sites, whereas the academic articles focused much more on the geographical and historical situation of the ancient remains. As it may be expected, there were also articles whose content incorporated more than one defining characteristic, whether they combined the academic perspective with the neglect of ruins or touristic tendencies, or combined the maltreatment of archaeological discoveries in regards to tourism in itself.\nOf my constructed database, 46.6% of the articles were predominantly academically inclined. These texts focused on heralding newly excavated discoveries, from lost temples to fine marble portraits, as well as updating the gazette readers on the progress of ongoing excavations and research. In an issue from September of 1905, the readers are informed of recently concluded excavations of the area surrounding Hierakonopolis. The site dated to around 3,000 BCE and had been previously excavated, so archaeologists focused on the surrounding area in hopes of finding outlying establishments separate from the city’s center. A series of exquisitely preserved alabaster and granite vases were uncovered near a collection of dulled flint knives.

Something that stands out in The Egyptian Gazette is the rate of murders that the newspaper covers. Throughout the paper, short articles explain, typically in detail, about any murder or attempted murder that has occurred within the week. These reports were significant to the population of Alexandria, Egypt because they warned the people of any potential danger they could be in; however, they are still significant to this day because they allow further studies and analysis to be done on the people and politics of the time. Additionally, the murders covered in 1905 provide insight to the gender differences in Alexandria, notably that women either did not murder or did not get caught- until fifteen years later. Although there was no clear trend over the course of the year, it can still be seen that murders increased as the year progressed. It is more the nature of the murders that are important in this discussion. However, the data is incomplete due to the nature of how it has been collected. College students at Florida State University worked to go through digital copies of this newspaper and transcribe it into readable, comprehensive data. This method, while viable, offers a significant source of human error. Even so, the information about the murders committed is, at the very least, mostly accessible. With the assistance of The Egyptian Gazette, the violent politics of Alexandria, Egypt in 1905 can be analyzed sufficiently, though not without limitations.\nOne notable change made to the data collected is the exclusion of the year 1906. Although select entries appear ranging from 1 January to 3 October, the data is so scattered and incomplete that it would not be advantageous to include it. For this reason, it has been omitted from the results so as to not skew any data. As it was, including search results for 1906, only two murders have been recorded for the entire year, one occurring in August and the other in September. The remainder of this project will not discuss 1906, but instead focus on 1905 only.\nBy performing a simple x-path query of //div[@type=“item”]/div/p[contains(., ‘murder’)], eleven results appear with the key search word included in the text. Upon further inspection, only four entries describe murders or attempted murders that actually occurred during the year. The others consist of reports of previous murders from the year before or describe a murderer who, at the time, was currently residing in prison. The results increase significantly when the x-path query search term is changed to //div[@type=“section”]/div/p[contains(., ‘murder’)]. 61 results appear, with 39 entries being entirely relevant to the question at hand. Similar to the first list of results, the others consist of past murders or are multiple articles covering the same case. Combined, there are 42 total reports and 53 total deaths. Because some were mass murders, the data changes to account for this factor. A search using //div[@type=“article”]/div/p[contains(., ‘murder’)] was done as well, though it yielded no results.\nThe number of people murdered, threatened to be murdered, or severely wounded with the intent to murder had a general increase as the year went by, but no strict conclusions can be drawn in this respect, as the number of deaths per month is too random. Graph A shows how many incidents occurred per month in Alexandria in 1905:\nNoticeably, April has the maximum number of murders, with all ten of these incidents being murders that were carried through, not threats or attempts. The primary reason for this spike is a group of 17 prisoners who, together, killed five people. With this act on top of five other single murders, the number increases dramatically. However, a simple statistical test shows that April is not an outlier, as follows:\nA Five-Number Summary Statistical Analysis of Deaths Per Month in Alexandria, Egypt in 1905:\nMinimum|0 First Quartile|3 Median|3.5 Third Quartile|6.5 Maximum|10\nTherefore, it can be concluded:\nInterquartile Range|3.5 Lower Fence|-2.25 Upper Fence|11.75\nThese fences describe the range of normal data. Therefore, an outlier does not exist unless the number of murders is less than -2.25, which would be impossible, or higher than 11.75. As the highest value is ten deaths in one month, there is no outlier; all data is valid. With this in mind, it can be seen how the murder rate increased as the year progressed. The first half of the year, from January to June, had an average of 3.5 deaths per month. In the second half of the year, from July to December, there was an average of 5.3 deaths per month. These numbers are plainly inaccurate, as there cannot be half a death, but the conclusion still stands: there was an increase of almost two more deaths by murder per month in Alexandria between the first and second halves of 1905. However, this conclusion is fairly weak and not the central point of this discussion. …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"2b0b7b3add8ec578f9052aca9db37fe0","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-hammermaster/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-hammermaster/","section":"post","summary":"How has the murder rate in Alexandria, Egypt changed over the course of 1905? Something that stands out in The Egyptian Gazette is the rate of murders that the newspaper covers.","tags":null,"title":"Changes in the Murder Rate in Alexandria","type":"post"},{"authors":["Joshua Story"],"categories":null,"content":"The city of Alexandria is a port city located in Egypt. The weather is typically hot and humid. For over one hundred years, the city of Alexandria has collected data on the warm climate. An Egyptian newspaper, the Egyptian Gazette, has listed the temperature in Celsius as well as the relative humidity every day for as long as the paper continued to be published. As science and technology has increasingly advanced, cars, livestock, and air pollutants have been theorized to gradually increase the average temperature of Earth. I will observe and analyze the comparative details between the listed temperatures in the Egyptian Gazette over the years 1905-1906, and a time one hundred years later specifically 2016. This analysis is incredibly specific, and only covers the weather of Alexandria; however, the outcome can serve as one instance that supports or does not support the notion that human advancement is causing global warming. I will be taking the listed max temperatures in Celsius for Alexandria. The analysis of the max temperature will not be as straightforward as one might expect. The idea of global warming is actually a misnomer, at least during the winter months. This results in global warming being evident when temperatures are not necessarily warm, but more extreme than usual. The winter months must be colder in 2016 and the summer months must be warmer in order for the change in temperature be constituted as global warming. It is important to note that the Egyptian Gazette’s weather report lists the temperature measured as “max temp in shade.” This just means that the measurement is not tainted by outside elements such as sunlight; the temperature of today is measured the exact same way so there are no discrepancies between the 1905-1906 group and the 2016 group.\nThe amount of cars in Alexandria during the early part of the twentieth century is incomparable to the sheer amount of cars present today in Alexandria. The technology of the automobile in 1905 was only twenty years old at that point. For the most part, cars were reserved for middle to upper class. The very few instances of a car being mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette usually pertains to a rich person. For instance, a lot of the automobile mentions pertain to someone who is of the royal family. In August of 1906, Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, cousin of the Khedive, was killed in a car accident.\nThis instance is one of the few times cars are even mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette. Other than anecdotal evidence from a newspaper, there is no survey that gives an accurate number for car population; however, to put into perspective the United States only had 78,000 cars in 1905. Considering that the United States was one of the original countries to pioneer the automobile, it is reasonable to suggest that the amount of cars in Alexandria never exceeded such an amount in 1906, and was probably nowhere near that amount. All of this evidence is to show the vast difference in the number of cars contributing to global warming between 1905-1906 and 2016. The difference is important to specify as this analysis goes off the basis that fossil fuel emission contributes to the warming of the atmosphere. With this in mind, we can expect any noticeable increase in temperature in Alexandria during the summer and a decrease of temperature in the winter to be indicative of global warming.\nThe Egyptian Gazette had a section in the earlier pages of the newspaper known as “The Daily Weather Report.” The weather report consisted of the maximum temperature for that day. The typically warmer months, summer and spring, in Alexandria were relatively temperate in the Daily Weather Report’s listings. The weather during the months of June, July, and August were the hottest of the year with a record maximum temperature for that time span of 37.5°C or 99.5°F. The average for the summer and spring months for temperature was a relatively warm 27.4°C or 84.92°F. This is somewhat expected from an area only 2,000 miles away from the equator. In the year 2016, the climate of Alexandria showed in an increase of temperatures in the spring and summer months. In the month of May 2016, the maximum temperature was recorded one day at a ridiculously sweltering 45°C or 113°F. This record temperature is almost 8°C higher than the record temperature in the years 1905-1906. The average maximum temperature of 2016 for the spring and summer months was 26.6°C, almost one degree lower than 1905-1906’s’s average maximum temperature. On one hand, the record high between the two instances a hundred years apart is far more than substantial. This record high would definitely hint at a warmer climate for the ladder group, 2016; however, 1905-1906 had a slightly higher average maximum temperature of the warm months. This evidence cannot, at least by itself, confirm or refute the idea of climate change. The average for the warmer months is incredibly close between the two groups.\nAs mentioned before, the …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"212a79375b1ea5519fa0ddf19684eb86","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-story/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-story/","section":"post","summary":"The city of Alexandria is a port city located in Egypt.

British control in Egypt led to the exploitation of the cotton crop. The 1832 defeat of Egyptian leader, Muhammed Ali, led to British control in Egypt. The American Civil War left British cotton supplies running low, leading to a growing interest in the Egypt’s agriculture. Egyptian cotton was referred to as “white gold” (Hidji, 2016). The crop was deemed a “consistent earner”, thus leading to British investment (The British Empire, n.d.). Today, cotton remains a main staple in Egypt, providing economic prosperity in the public sector. When cotton production slows, so does the Egyptian economy. Understanding trends in cotton production is essential to the maintenance of Egypt’s economic well-being. The collection of data regarding Egyptian cotton production makes trends in production visible and easily recognized. Seeing that some years offered greater yields than others can lead to a multitude of questions such as: what factors contribute to high levels of cotton production? What factors detract from cotton production? Answering these questions will lead to a better understanding of factors that contribute to cotton production.\nRecent fluctuations in cotton production have drawn attention from Egyptian citizens. 2013-2014 exports totaled 12.5 million pounds of cotton, 2014-2015 saw a rise in production to 24.4 million. However, from 2015-2016 all gains receded. With cotton having significant monetary impact on Egypt it is important to discover the cause of these fluctuations. An appropriate way to answer this question would be through the collection of relevant data. Some of the best literature to use when doing so includes old newspapers and government records. The particular sources I gathered data from are Norris’ “Cotton Production In Egypt”(1934) and the Egyptian Gazette. Cotton Production in Egypt is a government resource from the United states, Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This source mainly depicted Agricultural influences on cotton growth, such as temperature and humidity. The Egyptian Gazette is a British newspaper produced in Cairo, while Egypt was under British rule. The years I studied in it range from 1905-1906. My main goal with using the Egyptian Gazette was to find local problems that may have influenced cotton production. The newspaper had many tables indicating cotton exports and pricing. In using both of these sources I hoped that the past may offer some suggestions to the future of cotton production.\nMy search for information regarding cotton production was done mostly in the Egyptian Gazette. My classmates and I in IFS 2116, at Florida State University, are currently digitizing the newspaper. The aim of digitizing this newspaper is to make the documents easily accessible and to enable search functions within it. Doing so will make the Egyptian Gazette a source that can be easily accessed, providing relevant historical contexts and statistical information. The Egyptian Gazette is a credible source offering unbiased data regarding the production and exportation of cotton. As previously mentioned, digitizing the newspaper allows for its contents to be fully searchable. Its translation into markup language was essential to my discoveries of this statistical information, aiding my ability to find relevant information, thus limiting my research time.\nThrough my exploration of the Egyptian Gazette I found similarities in the newspaper’s formatting. There was up to 8 pages in a daily issue of the Egyptian Gazette. The first couple of pages are mostly ads, with articles starting in the last column of page two. Articles resume on page 3. Pages 4 through 7 carried the bulk of the information I used. In the midst of those page I came across a table titled “COTON”. The purpose of the table was to display exportation totals for each month of the year. As I was digitizing my week of the Egyptian Gazette it was one of the ads that frequently appeared. Not only did it display the total cotton exports but it also showed what country they were exported to.\nThe table that held the export data had a specific XML ID. Performing an XPath Query made my results very specific: //div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-cotn01”]. I found 37 items in the XML project files. The results displayed a distinct pattern in the data. There were 117,812 bales of Cotton exported in November 1905, however, there were 39,384 bales exported in May 1906. I wondered what could be the cause of the vast difference in monthly totals. Upon revision of my secondary sources, I found an explanation for these disparities. The planting of cotton takes place from February through April. The growth of cotton starts in April and goes through the October. November is the month that they harvest the cotton (Norris, 1934).\nFurthermore, I noticed that the cotton exports were recorded in units called “Balles”, which is French for bales.

According to Samir Raafat, it was composed of the best sugar plantations in Upper Egypt, included four hundred and seventy kilometers of railroads, sixty-five locomotives and 2,092 wagons, nine sugar mills, substantial irrigation and drainage canals, Nile steamers, tugs and barges, warehouses, crops in the fields, cattle and even entire towns.The sale of the Daira Sanieh removed one hundred percent of the agricultural union to a private sector. It was a former khedivial estate which had been used as collateral for one of the ruler’s loans that had led him into debt. Even after twenty years of government management, Daira was still in the red. This simple arrangement led to a strong economic era of Egypt. At this time, the National Bank of Egypt was founded and a local landed gentry was formed. The Daira Sanieh was easily the primary source of Egypt’s boosted and rejuvenated economy.\nIt all began on June 21, 1898, when the arrangement and agreement were reached and the government officially sold the Daira Estates for £6,431,500 sterling. This sum matched the Daira’s outstanding financial obligation. It was three out of four of the new owners of the Daira Sanieh that created the National Bank of Egypt. With these two new enterprises of theirs, they were able to create an enormous number of jobs and export markets. Because the dams were able to provide Egypt with cheap electricity, Egypt’s first perennial irrigation was constructed.\nWhen they began selling properties on the open market, they realized they had exceeded the loan amount because the value of the land continued to rise. They were quickly gaining huge profits on their investment. As time went on, they continued to strip assets by selling off the sugar mills, railways, and rolling stock to its newly incorporated sugar refinery.\nIt wasn’t until 1900-1906 that the remaining three hundred thousand feddans (Arabic unit of area) of land were sold. It was this transaction that created the first generation of large landowners and entrepreneurs from outside the foreign classes.\nFrom March 3, 1905 to August 13, 1906, the prices of the Daira Sanieh shares were recorded and extracted from the Egyptian Gazette. These share prices were taken from both the London Stock Exchange list and the Shares list. The line graph below displays the prices fluctuating throughout the year and five months from which the data was extracted.\nBefore the data is fully analyzed, it should be known that there could be some discrepancies that could affect the results of this data. There are certain areas in the graph that display huge declines of the prices of the shares. Although it may be possible the interpretation could be incorrect, it is very unlikely for these prices to have declined so drastically in a matter of a couple of days. It is believed this data could have been incorrectly submitted or not edited from the template given in class.\nFirst, the London Stock Exchange prices will be analyzed. Some instances to take note of could be found in the London Stock Exchange 3 (orange line) on June 2, 1905 and August, 20, 1905. Other than these two instances, the price tends to stay pretty consistent throughout the span of approximately a year and a half. There is another noticeable instance when the price spiked from 101 to 108 in the matter of less than a month between October 23, 1905 and November 13, 1905. As represented by the London Stock Exchange (purple line), around June 1, 1905 the stock began to rise from 21.5 to 28.125. From then on, it continued to stay consistent at this price until around July 13, 1905. It was at this time the price dipped, no lower than 24, for about a month and quickly rose up to 28.125 a stock. As displayed by the blue line, the London Stock Exchange 2, has some noticeable spikes in price. Up until July 11, 1905, the price stayed consistent at 180 per stock. It was on July 11th that it declined drastically to 153. Other than a small peak in August 1905, the price didn’t change very much until it began rising around July 31, 1906.\nSecond, the Share List is analyzed. Very similar to the London Stock Exchange, the prices stay very consistent except for a couple of strange incidents. Beginning with the Share List (dark blue line), the price stays at 180 up until August 25, 1905. It was at this time the price fell to 153 and stayed there until September 20, 1905. From then until October 23, 1905 the price progressively began to rise to 180 again. Other than a small decrease in price in November, the price leveled out at 180 the remainder of the time. After a rough start off for Share List 2 (red line) the price remained at about 28.25 per share. It wasn’t until April 24, 1906, that there is an extreme drop fall in price. Because the data shows that from February 26, 1906 until July 10,1906 is valued at zero, I believe this is only an error due to lack of data that …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"7d1965c1f82f760444044c5b5ffe6fe0","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-nunez/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-nunez/","section":"post","summary":"The Daira Sanieh was the largest state-run company in Egypt during the nineteenth century.

Should I do my blog on those random numbers at the bottom of every ad? No, I told myself, that seems too complicated. Maybe I could blog about my OCR troubles? But then again, that seems to basic. As I scoured the Gazette, and my brain, for ideas, a quirky name caught my eye. Madame Butterfly. As I looked a little into Madame Butterfly, I found out that it had been an incredibly popular play during the period and was presently making the rounds across Egypt. After doing my blog on it, I realized that Egypt certainly had other plays and concerts occurring throughout its various theatres. Putting two and two together, I started thinking that I could ultimately do my analysis project on the most popular theater in Egypt at the time: the Khedivial Opera House.\nFinding the Most Popular Theatre Just figuring out what theaters existed and were prominent at the time was its own journey. There were not any charts, that I could find, with a list of theaters in Egypt, so I used a series of questions to figure out theaters that may exist. I first searched for paragraphs containing Madame Butterfly and found a theater called Khedivial Opera House. Afterward, I tried searching for theaters, but theater was only used as a general statement rather than being part of a theater name. Instead, theatre was used in theater names, so I looked for that word instead. This gave me some problems because theatre could describe a travelling band of performers, such as the Verdi Theatre, or it could refer to an opera house or theater such as the Alhambra Theatre. I was unsure of what words I could query out to discern between travelling company and theater, so I ended up going into the articles and separating the two myself.\nLearning the ins and outs of XPath querying was brutal, and it was only made worse due to various misspellings of the opera houses. I initially tried to account for these misspellings by searching for them as well, but since each had at least one misspelling, I gave up trying to include these because of the variability. I ran into several issues when researching the amount of performances in the Zizinia Theatre that was unrelated to spelling. For some reason, Zizinia, a relatively popular theater, was achieving astronomical hits. Due to background research, I knew that the Khedivial Opera House was the most popular theater before it was tragically burned down in 1971, but Zizinia was achieving 152 hits compared to the Khedivial’s 60. I had been using a simple query that only searched up how many times the theater was mentioned in the Gazette //p[contains(.,‘Insert name’)]. I figured that the most popular theater would be the one most talked about in the Gazette; however, the Zizinia Theatre was named within the template for the “Magasins Victoria” ad. Sadly, many people copy and pasted this ad as is, or the ad never needed any changing to begin with. Either way, this ad really bolstered the amount of times the Zizinia Theatre popped up. To circumvent this, I created two queries. One said //p[contains(.,‘insert theater name’)][contains(.,‘company’)] while the other query said //p[contains(.,‘insert theater name’)][contains(.,‘performance’)]. I used company and performance because those were words constantly being used when an event was occurring in a theater. This brought Zizinia down to a more reasonable 19 and left the Khedivial Opera House in its rightful spot.\nThe Khedivial Opera House The Khedivial Opera House, alternatively known as the Royal Opera House, was a center for travelling companies from across the world. One of the most prominent of these companies was the Verdi Theatre of Italy. Part of the reason for this relates to Giuseppe Verdi, the founder of the theater, who performed the inaugural opera for the theater back in 1869. Rigoletto, one of his many masterpieces, had been the inaugural performance and it had eight new renditions from various traveling companies between 1905 and 1906. The Egyptian crowd considered it a classic and loved it every time it was performed, but none did it as grand as the Verdi Theatre company. The influence of Italians on the Khedivial Opera House doesn’t end there though. The theater was “constructed in only six months to the design of two Italian architects, Avoscani and Rossi” (The Khedivial (Royal) Opera House in Egypt) and commissioned by then Khedive Ismail. Khedive Ismail originally wanted the inaugural opera to be a grand tale about Ancient Egypt and national pride, but Rigoletto was played since the opera was not finished. He hired Verdi, a magnificent musician, Mariette Pasha, a phenomenal playwright, and Gialanzoni, a prodigious poet, to create the masterpiece ultimately known as Aida which played in 1871, two years after the opening (The Khedivial (Royal) Opera House in Egypt).\nThe opera house had been the “first in Africa, where famous world Opera and symphonic masterpieces …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"263631bf080b09aa6a725521a9553ee8","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-ali/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-ali/","section":"post","summary":"While trying to find a topic for my blogpost, I repeatedly ran into road blocks.

The Egyptian Gazette was a newspaper based out of Alexandria, Egypt that played a crucial role in informing its English- and French-speaking residents on the daily events that occurred within the city and around the world. Political, financial, and social happenings were also chronicled in addition to personal events during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A majority of the advertisements featured on the front page of this publication promote and advertise shipping and steamer companies that cater to this newspaper’s audience. This audience could consist of an average member of the working class looking to be a passenger and sail somewhere to find new opportunities, or to owners of corporations looking to transport industrial sized cargo from place to place in the most efficient way possible. However, when the prolific number of these advertisements are stripped away from the front page, only a handful of other advertisements are left, which left me wondering, what importance do the products or companies being advertised bear to be featured on the front page?\nFirst, to sort through and separate the advertisements that do and don’t advertise shipping and/or navigation lines, I utilized the XPath query feature on Oxygen XML Editor. The XPath query that I created ensured that the results produced would not contain any variation of the word “line”, which signifies that the post was advertising a shipping or sailing line. The final query I ran to find the results I used for this project was:\n//div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//div[@scope=\u0026#34;advertisement\u0026#34;]/head[not(contains(.,\u0026#34;line\u0026#34;))][not(contains(.,\u0026#34;LINE\u0026#34;))][not(contains(.,\u0026#34;Line\u0026#34;))][not(contains(.,\u0026#34;linie\u0026#34;))]\nWith this query, the content repository in which the existing files of the digital Egyptian Gazette are contained was searched, yielding results of advertisements on the first page that do not contain variations of the word “line.” However, because of some inconsistencies with spelling and punctuation, there were some advertisements for shipping and navigation companies that made their way in. After the query was run, the results were first exported into Atom where the results were cleaned up using regular expressions, and then into Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Excel was quite more efficient with finding the leftover advertisements that did not fit the set criteria when compared to the XPath query. Using the Find and Replace tool, I searched for the terms “shipping” and “steamer” and deleted the results that were found and also removed duplicate advertisements, which left me with a list of names of companies that chose to advertise on the front page of the Egyptian Gazette.\nThe remaining results with which I was left gave me an idea of what different categories of “other” advertisements showed up on the front page of the Egyptian Gazette. I categorized the advertisements on the basis of whether they were Financial, Insurance, Hotel/Travel, Railway, or Miscellaneous advertisements. Below is a bar graph illustrating the number of different ads each category contains.\nSince the front page seems to be a prestigious spot to place an ad, it is understandable only small numbers of companies from each category would choose to advertise here. Also, I broke down the “Miscellaneous” category into four subcategories (Textiles, Food/Drink, Engineering/Construction, and Communications). I believe that different advertisements that were featured on the front page were essential for the audience of the Egyptian Gazette to view and also reflected upon the needs of those living in Alexandria, Egypt in their day to day lives.\nDuring the early twentieth century, Alexandria was a center for those who were seeking out opportunities for employment and financial gain. Thus, it would be logical for banks and credit unions to reach out to the readership of the Egyptian Gazette and grab their attention. These advertisements would catch the eyes of those who were making profits toward self advancement and who search for more ways to make more money, whether it is through investments or taking out loans. Different banks also present different offers, and a consumer would be able to weigh out their options as they decide where they would like to spend their money.\nAlong with finances, many were also looking for ways to insure their existing and newfound assets from what they have acquired from their stay in Alexandria. The variety of insurance companies advertising themselves aim to satisfy the demand of the different types of insurance needed to protect one’s property and life from the unexpected, especially when living in Alexandria during this time period. No one knows what troubling situations with which they could be faced, and it is crucial to secure one’s belongings while residing in such tumultuous conditions, politically and socially.\nAs mentioned …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"09b39767f14b309e501ab85c9bcf71a6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-ng/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-ng/","section":"post","summary":"When looking at a newspaper, often the first thing that can be seen is the front page and the information that it holds.

If you were sit down and read it in one sitting, it would without a doubt be overwhelming. The week I was assigned for this class was February 19, 1906 through February 24, 1906. Uniquely, my week consisted of eight pages everyday unlike the majority of the other weeks only comprised of six. The major difference noticed when briefly scanning through my week was that almost every page seven was a “Vade Mecum” page. Vade Mecum is a phrase that represents a handbook or a guide of important information. In the case of the Egyptian Gazette, the vade mecum page comprised travel information ranging from shipping routes, to hotel advertisements, and important information regarding each location. The vade mecum pages only appear on a handful of days throughout the year, so to have it appear on five out of the six days of my week poses questions. It raised my curiosities as to what events occur that makes traveling so prominent around this time. The vade mecum pages were all identical and if not, they are extremely similar, therefore observing that page would not provide me with enough information to conduct a grand serial analysis. Thus, I will be observing the Calendar of Coming Events. This portion of the Egyptian Gazette provides a list of events that will be taking place throughout the next couple months within various locations. The question I would like to pose is what events are occurring at hotels in Alexandria and Cairo through the Calendar of Coming Events, and how this plays a role in travel patterns via the Vade Mecum.\nBackground Information This class called for the use of Microfilm. In order to obtain the information needed to conduct and perform this serial analysis, all students were instructed to go to the library to use the microfilm machines. The machine was called ScanPro 2000; which allowed us to take scans of each page of the week we were assigned from The Egyptian Gazette. This process alone was very time consuming because the actual films images were not very clean, and precise. Therefore, we had to take smaller clips of each page; within each clip you had to crop and make edits. It was a very tedious task getting the scroll wheel to stay in the exact place you needed for the clip, focusing and adjusting the brightness to the perfect setting, and the list can go on and on for a while. All of this was necessary in order to get the clearest image to make the next step in the encoding process easier. The next step for the pages that did not have advertisements, such as page threes, was to run the clipped images through Cisdem OCR Wizard, a program that allows you to convert images into text word documents. OCR alone was a huge time saver so we did not have to write out all the text but it still came with a great deal of issues. Some of which included misreading certain letters such as “c” and “o”, mistaking blotches in the images as exponent words, changing of fonts, sizes, and text boxes. As these steps were what we did majority of this semester; it truly was a lot of work and speaking on behalf of myself I am still working on this process.\nQueries In order to conduct my XPath query, I went to the how to tab located within our course website to piece together multiple queries to help narrow down my search results. A basic element used in all of my searches was the use of //div; this tells Oxygen to only search under the divs. From there, we have numerous routes to go down; based on the fact that my serial question deals with one specific “advertisement” I decided to search using the type and element settings. The following table consists of the actual queries and reasoning behind the use of each.\nProcedures After running my query, I extracted all the dates of the files involved, all the hotels, as well as events into a spreadsheet through software called Atom and Open Refine. This allowed me to take mass results and key in on portions of the files I was observing to gain the data needed to make my visual aids and conduct further analysis. Once I gathered all my information into one location, I transferred it to a system called Tableau; this system allowed me to create detailed tables and graphs for my visual, which can be seen below under the Analysis portion of this report.\nProblems This project was not very smooth sailing; I have encountered numerous issues throughout this analysis. The first of which was actually obtaining the actual functioning XPath query. It was all about trial and error to find a readable query that produced enough results to conduct an analysis. Although I did come up with one to that produced results, I was only able to get 76 files that used the proper structural tags or used the actual template that was provided for this advertisement online.\nSurprisingly, when running a query containing a specific word, more results were produced. My results went from roughly 76 to around 176.

Insurance is simply used just to insure someone’s property while they pay a fee to have the service in case the worst happens. My first encounter of any type of insurance in the Egyptian Gazette when I ran my XPath query was the mention of “fire insurance.” A company name Messrs is the company that sells the fire insurance. I assume fire insurance would simply just be to insure a person’s possessions against damage and loss against fire damage. This definitely shows a glimmer of the future of the modern world of insurance.\nOn March 11, 1905 there is a mention of a sunken or wrecked ship. The ship’s cargo is mentioned and that it’s being attempted to be salvaged. This salvaging is actually mentioned before the talk of insurance agents and that they are attempting to assess the damage themselves. This is basically the same as a modern day insurance quote. On April 6, 1905 a theater that was built in 1834 burned to the ground after a fire that broke out could not be contained. The paper speaks of the insurance company reaching a settlement with the proprietor of the theater. So here’s another example of insurance companies coming to terms with someone and reaching a settlement just like modern day insurance works.\nAUSTRALIA IN EGYPT AND THE SOUDAN THE NATIONAL MUTUAL LIFE ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALASIA, LIMITED FUNDS OVER… … … … $3,900,000 ANNUAL INCOME OVER $700,000 Up to 13th Degree of Latitude including KHARTOUM insurances effected at the same rates as in Egypt and England.

All Premiums cease on Father’s death. LOCAL BOARD SIR WILLIAM WILLCOCKS K.C.M.G Chairman R HENRIQUES Esq Director\nThis is a detailed insurance plan for annuities and life insurance the first I had seen throughout all the issues of the Gazette. Before we had only seen insurance cover loss of possessions not the loss of life or to provide an annuity. “An annuity is a long-term insurance contract sold by an insurance company designed to provide an income, usually after retirement that cannot be outlived.” This is a very advanced idea compared to the simple loss of possession insurance we had seen previously. This idea I had not seen in the previous editions of the Gazette so it shows some advancement in the world of insurance due to the era modern day insurance. This plan even had a life insurance clause for children. This advancement in insurance surely helped to transform the idea of insurance. On July 29, 1905 the theft of $1,000 from a ship was documented. It was reported that the losses were covered by insurance so again this is the loss insurance that I discussed earlier. So we’ve so far seen life, retirement, property, and loss insurance.\nA slight outbreak of fire occur at 16, Rue Abou Dardar, Alexandria, the other day but was quickly extinguished. The damages could not be recovered from the insurers, “La Polar” Sociere Anonyme d’Assurances, Bilbas, but M G. Kaul. agent of the insurance company, very generously subscribed the whole amount The house in which the fire broke out is a ladies’ pension which is managed by the Religious Sisters of Notre Dame de Delivrande.\nThis is an incident where the insurers did not dole out a insurance quota for the damage that was done because it was lesser damage. So now we are starting to see limitations on insurance policies and the money that insurers are willing to dole out for damages. These limitations are not fully defined though I feel that it is safe to assume only because the damage was minor that’s why the insurers were not willing to pay for the slight damages and then referred the damages to the client instead saying they basically can cover it with their own pension. This was said sarcastically in the quote I pulled from this edition of the Gazette. So not only do we see limitations but we are also starting to see almost an affront attitude towards from the insurers to people who seek payment over lowly damages.\nThe Homs-Hama extension served to develop, considerably the traffic of the company, and, as a natural corollary, widened the scope of. the commercial activities of Beyrout, while it reduced the port of Tripoli to a nullity.

Pandolfini managed to win the crowd over in acts two and three, but the long-awaited play certainly had more than one mishap.

Even though it is not as common as one might think it takes a bigger emotional toll on the friends and family of the deceased then the common sickness. Murder has also been the defining point for many countries and societies. In this paper, I will look at how the Egyptian Gazette reports murder. Moreover, I will analyze how each murder is reported in terms of the gender of the deceased, how they were killed, and the status of the murderer himself. Given the time in history I believe most murders were committed by using some type of weapon that is easily accessible like a knife, furthermore these murders were committed by men who which were ultimately arrested.\nIn doing my research I took a very direct approach. Given that murder isn’t such a common occurrence I concluded that there couldn’t be to many murders in Alexandria. After coming to that conclusion, I thought it was best to use a query that searched for the words “murder”, and “kill” throughout every single issue. After accomplishing this I found that there were about a total of 64 murders that happened between January 4, 1905 and May 5, 1906. After going through all 64 articles that contained the words “murder” and “kill” I found that the best way to pull the most information out of each article was to categorize the evidence by the gender of the deceased, how they were killed, and the status of the murderer. After organizing all this data I plugged into tableau into charts and graphs that you will see later in this paper to support my argument. To be frank there were a lot of other murders that were reported but all these were high numbers that mostly had something to do with military forces, I choose to exclude this data because I wanted to focus on the less common everyday murders between neighbors, husbands and wife’s, and even brothers and sisters. I also choose to exclude the location where each murder had taken place simply because there was not enough viable data to make comparisons. It is also important to know that every murder case that was reported the murder was of male gender except one.\nAfter analyzing the data, it was easy to see that the bulk of people who were killed are men, with a total of 36 of them murdered throughout Alexandria. As far as for women there were only a total of 18, and then the ten unknown. These “unknowns” is because the data is faulty since in some articles the gender of the deceased is not clearly stated. This is not all in all surprising because there is substantial evidence over the course of history that points that men are 77% more likely to be murdered then women. This because men are more prone to aggression then women. Much of the articles dealing with murdered males had to do with either two or more men who had a dispute over something to do with money, women, or reputation. One can see an example of this on page 3 of the October 8, 1905 issue in which two men had a brawl simply because they were shooting insults at each other, the conversation escalated until one of the men drew a knife out and stabbed his enemy twice in the chest. It is said that the victim tried to reach the local pharmacy but collapsed after just a few steps. Throughout the issues there are many more examples of petty murders just like the one above.\nIn evaluating the murder by gender, I found a correlation between the way the victim was killed and their sex. Eight of the men who were killed were stabbed, while only two females were stabbed. Additionally, six of the females were brutality killed while only four males. I define brutality as causes that are not common such as strangulation or thrown in a pit. The data is clear that the majority of women are usually killed in some strange way, now as to why this happens is not clear. These strange deaths again must be the result of aggression in men. Murders between a husband and his wife often happened because of some sort of jealousy. In the September 9, 1906 issue, there was a case about a man who murdered his wife because he was jealous about the man his wife would marry after his death. In recognize of his own jealousy he thought his only means to free himself from it was to murder his beloved wife. As far as for the men side of the story, given that they are all mostly stabbed leads us to believe that knives where the weapon of choice back in Alexandria in 1905 and 1906.\nOne of the most interesting things I found about the data I collected was the status of the murder. There were only 8 out of the 64 murderers who had not been captured by the police. Which leads one to conclude that either the Alexandria Police is a staple among all others or that the Egyptian Gazette only reports murders after someone has been has been deemed the culprit. Even out of the 22 arrest that were made how sure are we that the police got the right man?

And how many of these trials ended up in the death sentence or in something else. This drew my attention after seeing an article where there were three death sentences in only twenty days because of murders. This got me thinking and left me with my question, where do murders occur most frequently and how many end in the death sentence?\nTo start off my project, I did an XPath query using the word “murders.” This gave me about 132 results. I then went through each one and read the articles that popped up. I collected data of what crime was committed, which were mostly murders but sometimes included attempted murder, murder and robbery, threatened to murder, and double murder. I also collected where these murders took place. Sometimes the article would say a city and sometimes it would give the village of where the murder or victim was from or it give the village in where it happened. And finally, I collected what the conviction was just out of curiosity of how many murder trials ended in the death sentence. Some of the results I got were just talking about murder trials and were updates on when the trial would take place. Other results I got were nothing that had to do with a crime but had the word murder was used in the article somewhere. For example, “murderous” was used an an adjective to describe a hotel. Most of the results gave me what I was looking for and this way i could collect my data and make my visuals.\nI decided to use the word “murders” for the XPath query because that is what I was looking into. I tried many different words such as “executions,” “crime,” and “death sentenced.” When I put in those words in the XPath query, I got very few results or I did not get the results I was looking for. When I typed in “murders,” I found exactly what I was looking for. I was specifically looking for articles on a murder that had occurred. In these articles, I would look for what kind of murder or crime was committed specifically, where, and what the conviction ended up being. For almost all if the results that I received, it said where the crime had taken place. For a few, it did not. The same thing happened for the convictions. In some articles, it would not say what the conviction was so I assumed they were awaiting trial unless otherwise stated.\nThis image shows the places where the murders happened: I noticed that the place that had the most murders was Cairo. I think this is because Cairo was a very big city and a lot of people were concentrated there so it made for easier targets. And since there is more people, there is more of a likelihood that more people are going to get murdered there. I also noticed that most of the murders ended up in the death sentence. The ones that did not end in a death sentences ended with hard labor for life or they were awaiting trial or had just been arrested and not tried yet.\nThis image shows the conviction percentages of each conviction that was made for the murders: I also noticed that the people who committed the crimes did not have good reason to murder someone (not that any reason is a good reason to take someone’s life). Most of these murders were out of hate or jealousy of their victims. Sometimes the murders were accidents. For example, this man goes in to kill his wife’s lover but ends up murdering her brother. If this man was not jealous, he would have not died for nothing. Another example of this is when a man goes to murder another man and in his gunfire, he accidentally shoots an innocent woman.\nAs I was reading these articles on different murders that took place in the Egyptian Gazette in 1905, I noticed that the main way people killed another person is through the head. Some people shot their victims in the head with a gun and others took a rock or some wort of tool and bashed their victims head causing them to die. I also noticed when reading that many people when going to their assigned destination to receive their punishment do not put up a fight nor do they say anything. They just go willingly. Some people even confessed to their crimes on the spot without denying anything. This struck me as interesting because in today’s world, most people would not confess a murder they committed because they know it will mean life in prison. This makes me wonder if life in prison is worse than the death sentence. It could also be the times and how it was back then compared to how it is now.\nI can see how microhistory can teach one a lot about different types of things but one weakness I found that there is a plethora of results one has to go through in order to find what they are looking for. It took me a couple of hours to thoroughly read every article that I gathered in my results. In order to research sufficiently and thoroughly, it takes a lot of time which some people do not have.

It is a taboo and curiosity drives audiences to the unknown. Crime is often reported in news sources for safety and to pique the interest of readers. This is true today as well as in Egypt in the early 1900s. Evident in The Egyptian Gazette is the reporting of murders and other various crimes across the city and sometimes from across the world. What I wish to do in this paper is dive into news articles related to murder from 1905 and 1906 and use data and analysis to get a look at how often murder was reported, the methods used to report it, and what kind of murders were taking place in Egypt.\nData I wanted to give a separate introduction to the data I will be referencing throughout the paper. I began by taking the latest update of content files from GitHub and creating a project in oXygen. From there I had to come up with a query search to retrieve the articles I needed for analysis. I began the trial and error of finding the right search to yield the most data. I knew I wanted all the paragraphs containing the word ‘murder’ or any form of the word. I started with //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;)], but only received 70 results condensed mostly within 1905. Knowing there was a lot more data I was missing, I then decided to go with a much broader search of my XML files. The XPath query I ended up going with was //div/p[contains (., \u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;)], bringing in over 200 results ranging from January 1905 to October 1906. With the results, I was then able to create tables of reporting frequency as well as word frequency, in other words how many times a specific word was used across the 200+ articles. I sorted through the most frequent words and got rid of the structural and filler words such as “the”, “he”, “she”, “and”, etc. I will be using visualized forms of this data to draw my analysis and conclusions from throughout this paper.\nFrequency I counted the number of articles containing the word “murder” from each month from 1905-1906 and the data is as follows. A note to keep in mind when looking at 1906 is that it the data is still developing as more of the newspaper is being digitized.\nAnother note I would like to mention is I am not implying anything of a crime rate here. It would be safe to assume not all murders are reported in the Egyptian Gazette and creating a trend relative to frequency is not what I wish to do. I will point out however that the earlier months of 1905 and 1906, January to March, do see less reporting of murders. Whether this has ties to the rate of crime I cannot say, but nonetheless I find it worth pointing out. I also mined the word frequencies of the individual days of the week to see if I could find any trends in certain days having murder reported more or less often than others.\nThis chart counts every time each day of the week was used in an article. For example, the word Saturday was counted 27 times, being the most frequent by a wide margin compared to the rest of the days. Saturday seems to have been a very eventful day in terms of murder and the events surrounding it.\nThe Mystery of Murder When an event happens, there are a few go-to questions that circulate: “who?”, “where?”, “when?”, and “why?”. The question of when has been answered above in the “Frequency” section. It talks about how often murder was reported in durations of months in the Egyptian Gazette from January 1905 until October 1906. It also goes over the days of the week and how often they are specifically mentioned. Leaving us with four more questions. I mined data to hopefully give us some leads and answers to these questions. Let’s start with who.\nI have here a chart to visualize the data of gender and marital roles. It shows how often they are used across all the articles containing the word “murder”. Interestingly, man, or men, is used vastly more than woman, or women; however, wife is used more than husband. The issue with this data is how to interpret it. What one would need to do to further investigate gender roles on both the criminal and victim side of murder would be to query search murder and then read through the key articles containing the gender roles above, which is exactly what I did. What I found is that the “man/men” tended to be the murderer or the one accused of murder, where the “woman/women” tended to more often play the victim role. This plays in to the word “wife” being more frequent than the word “husband”. The reporters tend to use this more as a property/object role in the article. A “man and his wife were killed” or “his wife was killed” seemed frequent as opposed to a “woman and her husband” or “her husband”. Remembering the paper was written in the early 1900s; it’s not very hard to imagine the woman being more itemized as the wife than the man as the husband.\nThis chart depicts the frequency of nationalities across murder articles.

What I wanted to analyze was how often companies offered trips to New York, and where they were leaving from. My serial question was “How often do newspapers advertise passenger sailings to New York?\u0026#34; In this post, I will analyze the connection of New York to the newspapers in Alexandria, especially the Egyptian Gazette. I think this analysis is quite relevant to people today because it lets us get a glimpse of our history. We are able to see how popular of a destination our country was to emigrants in Egypt during the years of 1905-1906.\nDuring the course of my research, I noticed that in many of the occasions that involve ships moving to and from New York, the cargo is imports and exports, not people. This made my data collection quite difficult because my data source was quite small. An example of this issue that I have come across in creating my query; not a lot of advertisements include New York as a sailing destination. For example, N. Spathis mentioned New York in a table, but it had nothing to do with sailing to New York; it only involved the shipping of whiskey and other items. This affected my query because I couldn’t simply look for items that contain the words “New York.”\nOver the course of my analysis, I realized that only one company had an advertisement for trips to New York and that was the White Star Line. My query only gave me around thirty occurrences of this ad in all the newspapers that are in the content folder. I soon realized that for all the 1905 issues, there was not a template available last semester, and only a few good students took the initiative to make their own template. As for the 1906 issues, a template for this ad was created only recently so, I can make a safe assumption that not many students have gone back and added in the template.\nSome of the information that I have found is genuine, but most of the data that I have received is the same exact table. There are only two explanations to these results. One, students have copied and pasted the template that was provided and never updated it to reflect the true data in the newspaper. Two, there are just so few occurrences of these sailings, that each advertisement that occurs in the results that I have, are exactly the same. Either one, the data that I was able to find is very lacking and I would have loved to see a lot more information and advertisements of ships sailing for New York.\nConsidering my lack of data, the graphs I made include shipping origins and destinations of all the ships mentioned in White Star line that included New York somewhere in their path. I noticed that not all of the Destination points are also advertised as Origin points and vice versa in the “From”/“Due at” columns. For example, all of the ships from this ad leave Alexandria as their first point of origin, then they head to Naples, which is advertised in the “Due Naples” column. The next column advertises Naples as the next point of origin in a “From Naples” column. However, they do not show the next destination. The next column states that they leave from Azores with a “From Azores” column, but never state when they are expected to arrive in Azores. The next destination is good old New York which has its own “Due at New York” column, but there is another mystery here as the column following states “Due at Boston”, not giving any indication as to when exactly they are leaving New York. This ad also doesn’t state when it leaves Boston back for Alexandria again which is also another odd characteristic.\nIn my analysis I observed one ship that is advertised as being named “Cretic.” This ship is very different from the others, as it only travels to Naples from Alexandria and back. I find this interesting, because this implies that enough people and goods need to travel to Naples from Alexandria so much that they dedicate one ship to just these two locations.\nThe other ships travel to Naples quite a bit as well, New York and Boston have less occurrences, but it isn’t drastically different. I also noticed that depending on the ship, your origins/destinations can change.\nAccording to the graph above, both instances of the Canopic and the Romanic travel from Alexandria to Naples about the same amount of times, but the Republic didn’t stop at Azores the same amount of times as the Canopic. I also noticed the Canopic didn’t visit New York as much as the Canopic. I also compared the Romanic with the Canopic’s second advertised trip. The scheduled trips for both ships has exactly the same amount of trips to the same destinations, which I find interesting. Out of all of the shipping tables, the Republic was scheduled to go to New York the most.\nIn conclusion, although I didn’t get much data from the newspapers in the …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"8c61a8e07365f9aff3e14031ad635934","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-baxter/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-baxter/","section":"post","summary":"Working on the deliverables over the course of the semester, the question that kept popping in my head was “Why Egypt?” So, naturally, my first instinct when it came to my serial question was finding a way to connect it to the United States.","tags":null,"title":"New York Excursions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mia Meixner"],"categories":null,"content":"For my analysis project I decided to research weddings and their patterns and trends throughout the Egyptian Gazette. I ran many different XPath queries and got many different results, which I found to be very interesting. The wedding announcements were broken down into three main categories: military weddings, royal weddings, and regular or miscellaneous weddings. Most of these weddings are just announcements that the wedding is going to, or already has, happened.\nMilitary Weddings Although military weddings are not the most prominent in the Egyptian Gazette, they are definitely mentioned. The people mentioned in these announcements are people of importance. Often generals, ambassadors, captains and more are the people who are fortunate enough to get mentioned in this newspaper. It makes sense that you must be an important, or well-known, person in order to be featured. However, the newspaper doesn’t really touch on why these people are important. For example, this is a paragraph taken directly from the newspaper.\nA marriage has been arranged between Captain the Hon. Cuthbert James, Egyptian Army, second son of Lord and Lady Northbourne, and Florence elder daughter of Mr. and lady Alice Packe.\nThe most we know about this announcement is that the man is a part of the Egyptian Army and is the son of two important people. We see this because the Gazette mentions “Lord and Lady Northbourne” like they are well-known in society. We also see that the woman is the daughter of two important people also. We see this once again because the Gazette mentions “elder daughter of Mr. and lady Alice Packe” like it would be known who these people are. This is a common pattern throughout the Gazette. The newspaper will often mention people who are sons or daughters of more important people. Another instance of the Gazette mentioning someone’s family tree is as follows.\nThe marriage of Captain Kenrick, of the 11th Hussars, and Miss Helen Little is now fixed for April 29, at St. Mary Abbott’s, Kensington. The bride will be given away by her brother, Mr. Arthur Little (of the 20th Hussars), and the best man will be Major Bailey (of the 11th Hussars), who is the second son of Lord Glanusk.\nOnce again the Gazette mentions their family by saying “of the 11th Hussars” and “of the 20th Hussars”. It also says “the second son of Lord Glanusk” which shows that the readers should just know who Lord Glanusk is. Based on these results, we can see that it isn’t just enough to be a military captain or general. You must also be related to well-known people in some shape or form.\nRoyal Weddings This brings us to royal weddings. Even in the military section you can see that a lot of the generals or military personnel who are getting married are also related to someone who we can assume to be famous. Some of these famous people may actually be royalty. This section of weddings is the smallest of the sections because it is the most exclusive. Most of the people who are mentioned in this section are princes, princesses and people who are high up in the government. Many times in this newspaper it is hard to distinguish which category these weddings would fall into because they just mention the names of the people, like you are supposed to know who they are. For example, they mention “Mr. William H. Quintana” and we are just supposed to know why this man is famous. We can infer he is not in the military, otherwise he would have a title in front of his name. However, it is hard to identify if these people are just famous figures or royal figures. That is why most of the time you have to look for the title Princess or Prince. For example, the Gazette mentions…\nThe marriage of Princess Margaret to the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Norway and Sweden will be that that throne, too, will course of time be occupied by a descendant of James I.\nBy this example we know that these people are a Prince and Princess because it is obviously stated. However, I noticed that they are royalty from Norway and Sweden. This makes me think that they only mention that people are royalty if it is outside of Egypt. This would make sense because you do not have to say that the Queen of Egypt is a Queen because if you live in Egypt, then you would already know that. This made my research much more difficult. Now, lets look at the weddings that don’t fit into either category.\nRegular/Miscellaneous Weddings This section is definitely the largest because it includes the most kinds of weddings. There are weddings of ordinary people, who may have actually paid to get their wedding announcement in the Gazette. An example of this is as follows.\nThe marriage arranged between Miss Mary Prior and Mr. William H. E. Quintana will take place at St. Catherine’s Cathedral Alexandria, on Monday, 24th inst., at 2 p.m.\nThis is just a simple wedding announcement, which doesn’t show whether or not these people are actually important to society or not.

With the Egyptian Gazette I was able to do just that. By examining a small part of history between the years 1905 and 1906, I was able to learn about things not only occurring in Egypt, but how these same things applied to the whole world. For my analysis project I wanted to uncover more information about a small topic frequently covered in the newspaper. I chose to center my analysis and serial question on the plague that was affecting various cities in Egypt in 1905 and 1906. I wanted to learn more about the plague, find which cities and locations were most affected by it, and I wanted to uncover any trends that would reveal if the plague was spreading or decreasing during this time.\nI initially became interested in this topic when I was working with my week in the newspaper. As I was working through my third page of my newspaper, I noticed a small article about a plague affecting multiple cities in Egypt. The article was very vague as to what the plague was or anything about it. The article reported quite a few new cases, deaths, and a cure. I was immediately intrigued to find out more about this plague. I began to think of how I could turn this into a serial question. The main focal point of my research would be how the plague affected Egypt over time. I wanted to search through the entire newspaper to find out if the presence of the plague increased or decreased between 1905 and 1906. I wanted to build upon data collected by students in the previous semester that conducted their analysis on the same topic. To do so, I also included data from 1906 to see how the trends continued. Through my query, I hoped to find more information about what exactly the plague was, where it came from, how it spread, and which places were most affective. The article in my newspaper did not give me much information so I wanted to search the entire newspaper to find out more.\nTo develop my XPath query, I began experimenting with different XPaths to see how I could get back the most results regarding the plague. Since I found the article of the plague in my newspaper on page three, I began by searching through all of the page threes in the newspaper. After working more with oXygen, I realized that the most data returns came when I did a search on the entire newspaper and searched for any occurrence of the word “plague” in any article. I kept the query general by just choosing the word plague because the XPath query is case sensitive and I noticed while going through the articles, the word “bubonic” was misspelled on multiple occasions. If I were to make an xpath query that searched for the word “bubonic,” I would miss data. I also chose to search through every page of the newspaper rather than on a specific page because I noticed that in some of the issues, articles about the plague could be found on different pages.For the majority of the time, this was documented on page three but occasionally these articles could be found on page four. I also chose to solely search the word “plague” because the XPath is case sensitive and some people have not edited their issues yet and by doing this I eliminate missing information due to misspellings and errors. By searching the XPath query I created, I was able to find one hundred and eighty-seven results regarding new cases of the plague, deaths, treatments, and general information about the plague.\nThe process I used to collect data was slightly time consuming. To collect the data, I had to go through each result individually. I recorded all of the new cases that were documented as well as the date of the issue it was published in and the city where the new case was reported. I collected all of the data and put it into an excel spreadsheet. With this data, I created graphs to show the number of cases, by month, for 1905 and 1906. There was a trend that can be seen. Looking at the graph it can be seen that the plague peaked in the middle of the year 1905, around June and July, then began to decrease. The number of cases due to the plague began to increase again around the beginning of the year 1906, around April. I also used the data I collected to determine which cities in Egypt were most affected by the plague. The cities that were most frequently reported on were, in order from greatest to least, Alexandria (133 cases), Deshna (40 cases), Hehia (39 cases), Damanhour (34 cases), and Samalout (30 cases).\nOne problem I faced during my data collection was missing data. Not all of my classmates have finished updating their newspaper issues. This created problems because I am missing data that would contribute to my analysis. I am missing articles from many dates in the newspaper. This means that either some students have not done OCR to all of their pages or they have not edited their text so when I perform the XPath query, the articles about the plague will …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"f41f95be6fcc0ccf0e2fc1850d41091b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-migdalski/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-migdalski/","section":"post","summary":"Microhistory allows you to look at a small part of history and taking the information you find and applying it to a larger scale.

The table comes out once a month, and there is about a year and a half of the newspaper encoded. There was a result in March, July, 6 results in August, and 3 in September, all in 1905. The table of the prices of exports is released once every month, so in the encoded sections by other students, four months were found.\nOne of the problems collected from the first XPath query done was that some of the data from the newspapers was not entered into XML correctly. For example, in the online template for July, 1906, the export tariff of coton was 2475, grains de coton was 520, lentilles was 1800, and mais was 855. Some of the students (such as during the months of September and July 1905) did not enter in the correct data from the date of their paper. This error makes it difficult to examine the data because it is not correct from the months of the paper that the table was a part of.\nNext, in order to attempt to find more data from the table Tarifs D’Exportation, I used a general find search, non case-sensitive, in order to attempt to find more tables that were not entered in correctly but contain the data I’m looking for about the tariffs. I search for “tarifs d’exportation.” This search found 13 results in the xml documents. I found a new result from May 1905, that was the correct table with the information I need. There were also two results from August and two from September, three from November that contained inaccurate tables that were empty or missing. However, one of the November and a December results contained the table that was accurate and useful.\nSo, using the data in oxygen with other students’ data yielded some results, but not all of the months that I need. I tried other, broader searches in Oxygen in order to try to find more of the tables that may have not been correctly encoded when the person entered them in. I first tried to search for “exportation,” but the document yielded 570. I next tried to search for “tariff,” but it yielded 957 results.\nAfter trying many different searches, I decided to analyze the data that I found from 1905 only, because for some reason in the searches, no results from 1906 showed up in the data.\nIn the data, I noticed that two months, July and September 1905, contained the same results and the same table and numbers. I then looked at the Tarif d’Exportation template on the website, and noticed that the results in the July and some of the September issues were the same as the template, so the person did not enter the table in correctly. However, one of the results in the July issue was correct and did match the page files that I found in Github. I next found that the tables that were found in September 13,14 and 15 of 1905. Then, using the incorrect tables, I noted which pages they were on in which issues, and then I looked up in the page image files and found the correct values for the tables. I entered the results into an Excel document and first I created a table of the data:\nThen, using the table I created graphs for each of the different exports in order to attempt to find a trend line in the data to analyze the price of exports on each item. The first thing that I noticed when I created the trendlines for each export item was that all of different items consisted of very differently shaped trendlines with spikes in the prices at different times. For this reason, the data that I collected did not convey a certain theme within it, such as all the prices dropping or raising at the same time, because the different items peaked and decreased at different times throughout the year of 1905.\nFor example, the tarif of exportation of cotton peaked at a high of 3295 in May of 1905, then remained steady the rest of the year at around 2500.\nThe Grains de Coton was the trend line that differed the least throughout the year of 1905. It remained pretty steady around 500 until December when, what looks like a steep drop on the chart, to 400.\nThe graph of Lentilles (beans) went up and down a lot, with the main peak of the trend line occurring in July 1905, when it jumps up about 800 from the previous months. The graph then begins to level out at the end of the year.\nThe general trend of the mais (corn) crop was generally upwards throughout the year of 1905. There were no steep trends in the months as the progress/increase in the price of the tarif increased slowly from close to 800 to only about a little below 1000.\nIn terms of analyzing the data found from 1905, with the price of export tariffs of cotton, cotton grains, beans, and corn, the data did not clearly indicate peaks within a certain point of time that were all consistent with each other. In contrast, the prices went up and down without correlating with each other, or even with the general economic trends during the times of 1905.

Probably most people, even in the early 1900’s, could predict that Japan wouldn’t have any trouble with the Russian Navy. The Japanese Navy was strong and effective, which helped propel them into the international spotlight. There are tons of reports from both Tokyo and St. Petersburg about the battles in the sea, but what caught my interest was the reports of the fighting on land. We know the Japanese Navy was strong, but how would their Army perform in a foreign land? Would the Japanese stand a chance against the might of the Russian army who, before and after this war, won many battles through the ability to overpower and outnumber their opponents? The answer is a resounding ‘yes.’ According to the reports from both sides, Japan had no issue on land.\nThe first visualization I wanted to create to help visualize the small victories of both Russia and Japan was a timeline. You can find the full timeline here. I figured that the best way to present nearly 30 reports on fighting would be to create an easy to follow visualization that could quickly show the viewer which country made the report along with the report itself, one-by-one. Using tiki-toki.com, I created a timeline where each event is evenly spaced out. For each report that I added, I also attached a picture of the flag that correlated to where the report came from. Overall, I had nearly 30 reports, most of them from Japan. Reading these reports, you will notice that Japan was winning battle after battle while also losing very little men in comparison to the Russians. I can only speculate why the Russians had so much trouble with the Japanese, but one of the easier conclusions that I can make is that the Russians were not as invested into the war as Japan. With a little research using Wikipedia, I learned how this war began in the first place and what each side was fighting for. Japan was basically fighting to keep their influence in the region of China and Korea, which they felt was threatened by the Russians. The Russians, on the other hand, were attempting to get a warm water port, one that could be used year-round. If I had to guess, I’d say that any initial problems that Russia had would be due to an underestimation of Japan’s military might. It seemed that the Tsar expected an easy victory, and even when things were not looking great, Russia would not accept defeat if it meant bringing shame back with them. There was one report from St. Petersburg that convinced me that this was the view of the Russians. I think that later in the war, Russia began dealing with issues at home, forcing them to focus more on the civil unrest than their military endeavors. Looking at the reports from Tokyo, it seems that Japan was actually quite focused on the war. It may be that Japan, being a relatively small nation, was set on keeping other nations out of their sphere of influence. Doing this successfully could keep any dangerous threats far away.\nThe reports basically say that most of the fighting, or at least the fighting that both sides were willing to report on, occurred not too far north of Korea. The reports don’t directly say this, though. I myself did not know this just from reading the reports. Also, I decided that a timeline really didn’t help visualize what was actually going down in China, so I decided to create a map of the reported battles, showing the Japanese victories in orange and the Russian victories in black. You can find the full map here. I also had placed the reported battles in order, showing each point with a number. Overall, simply reading the reports doesn’t do enough to visualize the ground war. You can read them and have the idea that Japan was really effective, but you have no idea where the fighting is happening and how detailed the reports really are. The reports not only mentioned the name of the area, but also specifically named the distance that one battle was from another battle or town. They also, although I did not make a visualization of this, mention casualty numbers and the number of men captured for some battles.\nSo the question is, what can be learned from all of this information? I think what we can take from all of this is that Japan wasn’t just a dominating sea power, but was incredibly effective on land as well. Also, I think it’s important to realize that if things are not going so well at home, it will be incredibly difficult to take on such an effective military with as many distractions as the Russians had. This war didn’t really have any effect on the rest of the world that I’m aware of, but what it did do was introduce Japan onto the world stage, something that plays a role in decades to come.\nThe way I had obtained all of this information was simple. I had used the XPath query //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]//p[contains(., \u0026#39;St. Petersburg\u0026#39;)] and //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]//p[contains(., \u0026#39;Tokio\u0026#39;)].

This was during the third major outbreak that occurred in Asia (more info here). By this time, some preventive methods and treatments were known so being cured from the plague was possible. Since the rate of infections was shifting during this time, I wanted to know how many people were being treated in the hospital (spots occupied) and how many died in the hospital per month. Instead of looking at overall deaths contractions of the plague, I would be looking at how the plague affected hospitals during this time period. This question came to me while reading the ’local and general’ section of the Gazette. I noticed there was an article for the plague that not only mentioned the recorded number of new cases and deaths of the plague but also how many were taken to a hospital and what happened to those patients.\nTo find the answer to my question, I had to construct an xPath query to search through the various Gazettes. I started off by creating the query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(.,\u0026#39;the plague\u0026#39;)]. I noticed that this returned all items that mentioned the plague - even ads. So I changed my query to search for ’the plague’ under the head tag. //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/head[contains(.,\u0026#39;the plague\u0026#39;)]. I noticed that although this returned the correct type of articles I was looking for, it only returned some but not all. I realized that it was because on some it was typed as “THE PLAGUE” while others were typed as “The Plague”, “the plague”, or some other letter case variation. To solve that problem, I changed the query to //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/head[matches(.,\u0026#39;the plague\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] which uses the ‘i’ flag to ignore case sensitivity and just search for the phrase. Upon beginning to read through the results, I found that not all the articles about the plague mentioned anything about hospitals. Some just gave the total number of cases on the plague while others spoke about warnings or information on it. To ensure I only got back articles from the plague that also mentioned hospitals, I used the final query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/head[matches(.,\u0026#39;the plague\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::p[matches(.,\u0026#39;hospital\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] . By telling xPath to look for a paragraph sibling that mentioned ‘hospital’ I was able to find exactly what I was looking for.\nTo collect the data for my analysis, I sorted the numbers into two groups: the number of patients that were being treated and taking up space in the hospital and those that died in the hospital. For data accuracy purposes and to prevent any abnormalities, I ignored people that were brought to the hospital and found dead or any mentions of death or contractions outside of the hospital. These two groups were then further sorted by months. After collecting my data, I was able to construct the following graphs in Excel:\nFrom this graph, I inferred two things: A) There were a lot of months without any hospital data and B) The number of patients being reported seemed low.\nThese results led me to two further questions:\nFor the missing months, was the plague not mentioned at all? Was no one admitted to the hospital for the plague during those months? and Was the low number of patients normal, above normal, or below normal when compared relatively to the amount of deaths or new cases being reported outside of the hospital? To find the answer to the first question, I used the following query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/head[matches(.,\u0026#39;the plague\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] ) This way I could see what the Gazette said about the plague each day and if there were some months that didn’t report any cases or if it did but didn’t report any hospital cases. While reading through the results however, I found that the Gazette also wrote articles about the plague with the title “bubonic plague” instead of just “the plague”. Some of these articles mentioned hospital reports so I ran a new query with: //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]/head[matches(.,\u0026#39;bubonic\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;i\u0026#39;)] (some entries were typed as bubonic plaque instead of plague) This brought up new results that I hadn’t seen before and re-populated my data with this new information. The graphs were slightly altered and generated this in Excel:\nStill, even after these new data points, I was still missing a significant amount of months from my graphs. I returned to my previous query searching just for the plague and began to see if those missing months didn’t in fact mention any death or new cases. I found that:\nFebruary started off with a clean start. New cases almost immediately were cured. Only 1 fatal case was reported. No articles on the plague were written for the month of March. April had low numbers of cases reported. Only about 5 were reported. In October, Egypt was declared plague free on the 23rd. In November, only one case was reported.

One page, the “Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound,”\u0026#34; is particularly interesting and gives travel recommendations for people leaving Alexandria, Egypt to travel all over the world. The “Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound” varies throughout all of the editions and gives the reader different recommendations based on the time of year and when the issue was published. I have picked three different issues from varios seasons of the year, and compared them to see what the author in Alexandria in the early 1900s thought the best areas were for Egyptians to travel. The issues are from March 13, 15 and 17, 1905 (all the same two pages published throughout the entire week), December 5, 1905 and February 23, 1906. Throughout the entire content fork of IFS2116 I was only able to find these three Vade Mecums. There was one other one that was written in the comments “Vade Mecum for the Homeward bound, do not know how to format this,” so this shows that there are more throughout the microfilm but not readily available to analyze in the class’ XML documents. They are also all in different formats, and I assume this is because the Egyptian Gazette offered more travel information at different times of the year for its subscribers. For example, when people traveled more in summer there would be more extensive travel recommendations and detailed trips, while when people in Alexandria are less likely to travel it would be less useful, therefore only one page was published instead of two.\nThe process I chose to analyze these “Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound” pages was to look at all of their travel suggestions and the page formatting. I first realized that they ranged from being a single page to two pages, and this was based on the number of recommendations the writer made in that specific issue. The Vade Mecum from the whole week of March 1905 was two pages, and I believe that this was because it was a peak travel time for Alexandrians, so the Egyptian Gazette had more destinations to suggest to travelers.\nI used two different XPath queries to help me learn about the differences in the issues of “Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound.”. Each of them helped me find something new, but at first I had to create one to help me actually find the other Vade Mecums within the IFS content fork. I used count(//div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-vmhb01\u0026#34;]//div). This helped me find the two other issues from February and December, as well as the other one that was not fully coded but acknowledged in the comments. The other XPath query helped find the number of divisions in the different “Vade Mecum for the Homeward bound” issues to learn about the different styles of formatting used by the Egyptian Gazette, and that query is count(//div/head[contains(.,\u0026#39;Vade\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::div).\nThe first XPath query helped me find the other issues of the Egyptian Gazette that contained a Vade Mecum page and the second helped find the number of divisions they contained. The most common number of divisions was 87. I believe that this was because the template offered online for this page had 87 divisions and the students who encountered this page did not edit it to fit their specific issue. I also encountered a problem with this because I typed out every detail of the March Vade Mecum but in my XML document only technically says it has 14 divisions when the query is returned. This is because every other column in the Vade Mecum is filled with advertisements. These advertisements are mainly for hotels in the recommended travel destinations. Since there were so any ads and they were not available through the GitHub page when creating my XML document I had to put the names and their corresponding information into the comments, therefore not having a division like there should be after each one. When it is put into the comments it does not count as a division, so this alters the information given by the query search in Oxygen.\nIn total, there were 323 mentions of specific destinations within three different countries: Italy, Greece, and Switzerland. These places ranged from cities, municipalities, and resorts to mountains, springs, rivers, and islands. The March issue was the most detailed and gave very specific travel information with 220 places mentioned throughout the three different countries. The March issue also split Italy into a few different articles, which was unlike any of the other issues from December 1905 or February 1906. It split the Italy travel guide into Southern Italy, Sicily, Central Italy, Northern Italy, and the Italian Lakes (Italian and French Riviera). The entire first page of this issue was completely dedicated to travel throughout Italy. It mentioned all the different sights that should be seen, and included the easiest and most efficient way to travel there (most likely by train – early 20th …","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"0e19126997665b6d74187bb237e6be12","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-bolton/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-bolton/","section":"post","summary":"Throughout the Egyptian Gazette there are many different types of pages that convey different information to the reader in the early twentieth century.

So I decided to undertake my analysis project with a focus towards learning more about insurance in the context of the Egyptian Gazette newspaper. Most of my research was done by using the XPath search functions and reading some online media. In this report I will discuss what my findings were, my research process and analysis, and some ways to continue this study given what information I have now.\nInsurance vs Assurance One of the first things I noticed while scanning the newspaper for insurance ads was that there were a handful of ads for assurance firms as well. From what I understand, assurance is just another form of insurance. The rates, policies and procedures are different, yes, but they serve the same purpose. In fact, many insurance ad blocks advertise both forms by placing two firms of different specialties in one block. For example, the Royal Insurance Company is almost always grouped with the Phoenix Assurance Company in their ad block. I suspect the firms cooperated or are affiliated in some way to occupy that space.\nI do not see much difference between the two forms of insurance to warrant excluding one form from my analysis. In the future, extensive analysis of insurance or assurance alone might make for more discussion of this topic.\nInsurance Firms and Their Specialties I started my analysis by using XPath to search for every insurance and assurance firm mentioned in the newspaper within the number of issues available to me. Here are some of the core searches that yielded the most results:\n//div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//head[contains(.,\u0026#34;Insurance\u0026#34;)] //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//head[contains(.,\u0026#34;INSURANCE\u0026#34;)] //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;][@n=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34;]//p[contains(.,\u0026#34;insurance\u0026#34;)] To summarize this approach, I browsed every paragraph (p) and header (head) for the variations of the words “insurance” and “assurance”. The vast majority of results came from the first two pages of any issue, in the form of advertisements.\nSearching anywhere else brought mixed results: mentions of insurance within headers were rare outside pages 1-2; searching within paragraphs, however, brought some success. These results came in the form of articles. While some firms were mentioned in the articles, I ultimately decided to narrow my focus to advertisements, as the articles’ information regarding firms was not sufficient for the type of analysis I wanted to undergo.\nHere are all of the insurance and assurance firms I found, their specialties, and their founding dates.\nThere is a relatively even distribution of fire, life, and marine insurance firms, as well as combinations of the three. A handful of these firms are grouped together in the newspaper. Such pairs include Edinburgh Life and Society of Canton, and Royal Insurance and Phoenix Assurance. The number of different firms is smalller than expected, but they appear quite often the newspaper. Based on my searching, a moderate percentage of these firms make daily appearances in the newspaper issues for some time.\nThe prevalence of these forms of insurance may be explained with historical perspective. Egypt in 1905-1906 is a colony under Britain, and Britain brought to Egypt its forms of trade and business. Britain having port cities is an explanation for the presence of marine insurance in the newspaper, for example. Most if not all of these firms are founded in London or Europe at the least, and it seems most of them had spread their business practices.\nA Closer Look at Some Insurance Firms The 1921 Insurance Almanac by The Underwriter Printing and Publishing Co. provides descriptions of multiple insurance firms found in the Egyptian Gazette.\nSun Insurance Office The Sun Insurance Office is the oldest insurance company in the world, having been organized in 1710. It was known as the Sun Fire Office until 1891, when by act of Parliament its present title was assumed and the company received authority to transact all kinds of insurance. The resources and operations of the Sun are very extensive; it covers a great variety of risks and has agencies in all parts of the world.\nSo about a decade after the time frame of this analysis, The Sun Insurance Office became a strong force in the market, with assets in the quarter billions. Sun Insurance was one of the more prevalent ads in the Gazette at this time as well.\nPhoenix Assurance Company, Limited The Phoenix is one of the largest and most widely operated Fire Insurance companies in the world. Its assets approximate $95,451,688; its surplus and special funds $11,584,565. The reputation of the company is of the best in all respects; its strength is most impressive, its respect for its obligations is traditional, and its operations have been attended with exceptional profit.

The sports I found to be most reported on were Football (soccer), Cricket, and Regatta Races (boat races). When thinking of an analysis project of my own I started to wonder if this really held true for the whole edition and if that’s what was most important to people at the time. I wanted to know if I was only seeing those sports and not others being reported on just because that’s what was in season or was it really the only events being held in 1905. I thought that maybe since my pages were in the February/March editions that maybe the editions in other months held very different sports being reported on.\nTo answer my questions, I composed and ran an X-Path Query in our repository of the Egyptian Gazette and then read the articles and see exactly what time of year the article was written and what sport it was about. The X-Path Query I ran to accomplish this task is //div[@type=\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]//head[contains(.,\u0026#34;SPORT AND PLAY\u0026#34;)\nThe Sport and Play section was a very common article found on mostly page 3 of each day and was purely about the Sports that happened on the previous day and the outcomes of the matches/races or about upcoming big events. Returning about 108 results from this only from 1905 this was a perfect Query result. There are many infrequency in the repository though, Summer months like July are reporting 10 days’ worth of the article when March only had 3 days’ worth of content. I can’t explain why these results are so infrequent because it very well could be that the newspaper only included a limited amount of these sections per month or it could also be due to poor editing from the individuals that have not completed their assigned days yet.\nAfter running through my results, I composed this graph shows the number of occurrences the Sport and Play article appears per month just really showing how much of a drop there is in the month of March and even in February. This has affected my results because I now must approximate the seasons of the Sports without having an even database to base my result from.\nThis was not the only complication in this process of trying to analyze the Egyptian Gazette. Attempting to find a Query that gave me a decent amount of feedback took a long time because of the inconsistency of the editors. I knew I wanted to look for the Sport and Play section but this section is formatted in many ways. Since query results are case sensitive there are many articles that are formatted with the casing of “Sport and Play” or “sport and play” which I have also included in these results I have found. The other problem was that some people listed this section as a p (paragraph) instead of a head (heading article) so I had to add those results in as well. The infrequencies were the thing that complicated this project and search results the most.\nWhen reading the sections, I started to take notes on what was being reported that day and making tables and tallies for which month and which sport were being reported on. I composed a line graph showing the month being published and which sports were being reported on by amount of mentions per month; this was the first graph you saw at the top of the page. This graph though also really shows the amount of a drop every single Sport receives in the Month of March instead of how you see Football take a complete drop not stating one article between the months of June and September. Since there are many other Sports being reported on not just losing the full articles I have concluded that this time of the year must be the offseason of Football in Alexandria and Egypt in general.\nThis table also shows that there are what seems be seasons of sports for at least some sports. There are a few sports that seem to be reported on all year long like Horse Racing and Cricket. I included only some other sports in the table because it is already a very busy table and the data of the amount they were reported on weren’t enough to conclude if they had seasons or not. But in fact, other huge sports like Football and Regatta Racing there are huge spikes in different seasons. Since this is exactly what I was looking for I focused my main data points on these two sports. Cricket and Horse Racing are included to show that not all sports had seasons but many did in fact have them.\nThis graph is a real indicator that there is a specific season you can identify and what I marked with the black Lines and shaded parts underneath the graphs is what I believe is the season due to frequencies of the specific sports …","date":1493424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493424000,"objectID":"04b65ed4bc510491331ed744682ef1f3","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-baenen/","publishdate":"2017-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-baenen/","section":"post","summary":"For my Analysis Project I have decided to look at the Sports happening in the editions of the Egyptian Gazette 1905-1906 and determine what the most popular season for Sports was and how the time of the year affected which sports were being reported on or not.","tags":null,"title":"Seasons of Sport","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tanner Doring"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"While finishing the Tuesday edition of my week, I came across an article titled “Women and Lying.” This article was not only random, but shocking in how aggressive it felt. The article talked about how “women lie more constantly, laboriously, and cleverly than men, and in larger proportion.” The author of this article is very meticulous about describing how women lie. Not only does he mention how women lie through changing their appearances, but also how they lie through their feelings, their views, and their tastes. The author then goes onto describe how a woman will lie to alienate your feelings, convincing you to open up your “heavy gate” and walking right in. It is concluded that the more a wife lies, the smoother the marriage goes.\nOverall, this was the article that stood out to me the most within my entire week. Not only was it aggressive, but it was very detailed in how, according to the author, women are very successful liars in almost every aspect of life. Without a doubt, reading this could teach you a lot about how women are viewed in the early 1900’s. It’s clear that women were not viewed as equals at this time and did not receive the respect that they had deserved. You can also learn from this the type of articles that were considered acceptable to write about in the paper when there was nothing else important to report.\nRelated blog post by MELIZZA BLACK: [“Avoid Female Society”](“Avoid Female Society”) Is this the female society that we are trying to avoid?\n","date":1493251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493251200,"objectID":"70ef308bfbd29a3c110dedc1f2b02dde","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-27-doring-blogpost/","publishdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-27-doring-blogpost/","section":"post","summary":"Someone had a bad breakup...","tags":["women  "],"title":"Women Are Always Lying?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hayden"],"categories":null,"content":"By looking at the history of the sport of sailboat racing during 1905 and 1906 in Egypt, one can learn several things about the culture. I looked for all sections throughout the 1905 and 1906 issues of the Egyptian Gazette that mentioned the word “regatta”. This brought back about 30 results in different issues, mostly in 1905. Sailboat racing seemed to have been a popular recreational sport since it is in the newspaper almost every week during the summer. The regatta section occurred mostly in the third page of the issue and was under the sports section. The posts would vary from results to handicapping protocol for the upcoming regatta. There was also articles every now and then mentioning the Khedive watching the racing. It may have been a symbol of status of the yacht club or he may have just enjoyed watching the racing. There seemed to be a good amount of boats at each regatta and many of the same boats raced each week. It would have been interesting to learn how big the boats were and how many people crewed on these boats.\nIt was difficult to get this data since many of the xml versions of the paper had this article in a paragraph format. It was much easier to see the data when the editor put it into a table that matched how it looked on the actual newspaper. The order of the data was important since the places of the boats and the captains could get mixed up. It was also difficult in some cases to pull all the data from these sections. I ended up having to input it into Excel manually and make the graphs that way. Some of the boat names and captains names were spelled one or two letters different from week to week. This led to duplicates in the graph that were not truly different people or boats.\nAlmost every article I saw mentioned a handicapping protocol for the upcoming regatta. I have experience racing sailboats and am apart of the sailing team at Florida State. The handicap system is used today for racing against different types of sailboats. It adjusts your elapsed time to make faster boats and slower boats equal for a fair race. I think that the handicapping described in the Gazette is close to the same as the type we have today. The start times that are listed are the time of day that each boat starts the race and the finish time is the time of day that the boat finishes. It is not clear if the handicap was for the different boats or it was assigned to the skill of the captain. This link explains a little bit about today’s system to make racing between different boats as fair as possible.\nAs viewers can see, the start times vary for each boat. The table also lists the Captain’s name, in which you can sometimes find a Prince, or Lieutenants steering boats in the races. This and the fact that the scoring is consistently in the paper leads me to believe the races were for upper class citizens. It would be interesting to know what the yacht club was like. The paper doesn’t really talk about how many members the yacht club had. Looking at the other evidence, I think that the club was upperclass and probably had social functions outside of sailing, like many clubs today.\nIn this section of the newspaper you can see that the Khedive was coming to visit the yacht club, furthering the assumption that the racers were upper class.\nThe article says how the Khedive enjoyed watching the racing. This articke also mentions the Rowing club which may have been a part of the yacht club. After inputing the data from several regattas into excel, I was able to create graphs that showed the amount of races as well as the average of each boat’s finishes. This data was mostly found in the summer months of 1905 issues. I found that most of the same boats participated in every regatta, but the captain’s name would change every now and then. It was difficult to find some of the scoring articles since some people from the 1905 issues never uploading their page images and some were tables that were updated by OCR. It looks like they did as many as 20 regattas throughout the summer season. It is also interesting that as time passes, the race directors would update the handicaps and the finish times would get closer together.\n","date":1493164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493164800,"objectID":"3686b17f48b6804fe8a3029ce8f0311d","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-hayden/","publishdate":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-hayden/","section":"post","summary":"By looking at the history of the sport of sailboat racing during 1905 and 1906 in Egypt, one can learn several things about the culture.

History has always been fascinating to me simply because I picture everything as if it were occurring right in front of me. By entering the time machine of life, I indulge into the knowledge that the past has to offer. During the 1900s, the Egyptian Gazette was booming within the public-eye, with material ranging from traveling options, steamer passenger lists, and even the price of coal per ton. IT HAD EVERYTHING. If you needed to read a non-fictional murder story, the Gazette had it. This wide range of material is what made my serial question process more difficult than it should have been.\nAs soon as my instructor announced the project, I instantly had one thing in mind: politics. While encoding the issues in my assigned week, Monday, January 15th, 1906 to Saturday, January 20th, 1906, I would notice very interesting news stories regarding the nature of politics at the time. It was gritty and truthful, and honestly, because the paper had an intense focus on the ‘liberal-type’ political parties at the time, I strongly assumed that the paper had a liberal bias. Everything was fine and dandy until I realized that my political based serial question was not serial at all. In fact, it was extremely broad, and would confuse even the smartest historian in the world (well, maybe). So, I swallowed my pride, and developed an entire new question, on a subject matter that I thought was completely unrelated to politics, the coal industry. If your company had anything to do with the coal industry, chances are it was booming.\nGas coke and foundry coke, both a type of coal, hail from different origins. Gas coke is caught from the combustion process of gas retort. Foundry coal is special coal refined for using in blast furnaces. Both are important, and were the key components of any kind of steel creation at the time. If you traveled on a steamer throughout Europe at the time of the Egyptian Gazette, chances are you were riding on a vessel that found its origins from the precious fossil fuel. Coal was also a major player in the Industrial Revolution years before, so the product interested me. It interested me enough to develop the question: Has the price per ton of ‘Gas Coke’ coal displayed a rising trend from the beginning of 1905 to the beginning of 1906?\nAs for creating the XML search query that can be used to solve the serial question, I started simple. When working with XML, I noticed that the code is all one big tree of text. You start large, then narrow your search. An XML search query looks like this: //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-coal01\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#39;Gas Coke\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]. The first word, in this case, “table”, designates a search for a specific table within the text. For my serial question, the table id will take you to the table containing the prices of various coals per a ton. The next section of the query designates a specific search within the “cells” of the tables. The query designed to answer the serial question targets the cell containing ‘Gas Coke’. The last string of text finalizes the search, with locating the numerical data in the cell next to the cell containing ‘Gas Coke’. If all goes well, you should be able to instantaneously search for the price per ton of gas coke in every encoded issue of the Egyptian Gazette, from 1905 to 1906.\nAny decent history paper is going to have illustrations and pictures to guide the audience on the rocky road of historical information. I wanted an image that would help answer the question for individuals who learn better with visual stimulation. So, a line graph was crafted, with the respected dates labeled on the x-axis, and the price of gas coke labeled on the y-axis. The data displayed on the graph visually represents the trends in the price of the coal. This is essential for the cross-referencing of data to further support any argument regarding the serial question. The price of gas coke throughout 1905 and 1906 was constantly changing, with the minimum prices per ton reaching a low of 27.3 Shgs., and the maximum prices per ton reaching 38.6 Shgs.\nWhile analyzing the data, I wanted to find the reasoning behind the sudden dips in coal price. For instance, on August 2nd, 1905, the price dropped from 38 Shgs. to 30 Shgs. in the matter of a night! While encoding the Gazette, I noticed that on page seven of all the issues in my week, there was a detailed travel itinerary. The itinerary was meant to encourage tourism throughout Europe, and spark economies across the board. The itinerary frequently mentioned the use of a steamer ships to cross large bodies of water, and I knew that this was the needed support to answer the question. Could there be a correlation between steam lines, and the price of coal? A high demand for steamers, combined with a set supply, sparked a rise in the steamer ticket price. I also noticed that throughout the …","date":1493078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493078400,"objectID":"e4dcf65e896bbb75cd6c6dee8bc3fcfc","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-greco/","publishdate":"2017-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-greco/","section":"post","summary":"Whenever I ask my grandparents to tell stories about their childhoods, I place myself back in time to the early 1900s.

More importantly, my focus was primarily on the “Land Bank of Egypt” stocks and prices throughout these two years. I found it easier to study this specific bank because it had the most different and abundant data out of the other banks and stocks. I was hoping to encounter some significant highs or lows in these two years, and if I did find any I would dig deeper and find the cause of this fluctuation in the market.\nFirst, to be able to come up with enough data to analyze the “Land Bank of Egypt” I created an XPath query that gave me sufficient information to be able to look through the prices in an organized fashion. After a couple of different queries attempts, there was finally one that brought me almost exactly where I needed to be. With this query, //table//cell[contains(.,\u0026#39;Land Bank of Egypt\u0026#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/string(), I was to come up with the a refined set of numbers that showed the prices of only “Land Bank of Egypt” in all the financial tables that came up in the Egyptian Gazette. Coming up with a proper query that gave me the correct information that I needed was probably the most difficult part of the data analysis.\nThe next part of the process was to then clean up the data that I had come up with using the XPath query. Using atom, I had to clean up the data to be able to make a table or graph out of the data I had collected. This step of the process was not the most difficult, but definitely was the most tedious. Trying to use regular expressions to help clean up my results was also very frustrating. After a while, and after trying many different methods I finally came up with data was ready to be inputted into a line chart, which I thought would best represent the data. I encountered the problem that there were many of the same prices throughout the data, because this was on the templates we used. I decided to keep these prices in the data for now, until I can figure out if I am going to take out completely the template prices or keep them in the data.\nNow that the data has been cleaned up and put into a chart anyone can see the fluctuations in prices throughout the years of 1905 and 1906. Instead of using Tableau I put in the dates and prices for the “Land Bank of Egypt” in excel because I am more familiar with it. In the prices column that I had created in excel, I put in a formula that found the minimum price from all the prices. It came back with the price of $8.00. This is how I was able to find where the price for the “Land Bank of Egypt” was the lowest. I plan on doing the same and inputting a formula that would give me the max of the prices but it seems that the template price is $239 which is the maximum price. This skews my data significantly and I am not sure what I will do to get past this.\nSince there were so many prices that were from the template or missing, I came up with an idea that would fix the graph that I had started off with. I was able to find the average of the prices for each month in excel. After doing this the graph was much more clean and was easier to read and understand. At this point now I had some good data to work with, which was relieving. Below is the graph that has the averages of the prices of each month of 1905 and most of 1906. Finding the averages was very helpful because it really took away the random ups and downs that I found before due to the template prices.\nAfter some research, I was able to find some information as to why there were some changes in prices and how international banking came to Egypt. The Franco-British entente of 1904 stimulated the influx of foreign capital and the creation of new banks (Cameron). In 1905 French capital created the Land Bank of Egypt through the initiative of the Societe Marseillaise de Credit and banks from Alexandria, Marseille, and London. In the graph you can see the decrease towards the end of the year in 1906. This is thought to be because of the approaching financial crisis that came about in 1907. After the full force of the crisis had passed there were three banks that were established in succession by French capital. The bringing up of these institutions drove into bankruptcy their competitors. This is why you can see the steep decline in the average prices of The Land Bank of Egypt. There were, however some strong moments in the life of the Land Bank of Egypt. In the beginning months the bank had a nice peak, and then had a steady level throughout the year. This was when the foreign banking system was just beginning and showed that it had a strong market in Egypt. The Land Bank of Egypt did trade different currencies, but for the sake of keeping the graph readable I only chose data of the same currency. By trading different currencies the Land Bank of Egypt was a very healthy and strong financial institution in the …","date":1492992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492992000,"objectID":"92a84146a5e0d389294ec7827b7eaa9b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-martinez/","publishdate":"2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-martinez/","section":"post","summary":"My goal throughout my research in the Egyptian Gazette was see if there was a way to determine when there were ups and downs in the economy during the years of 1905 and 1906.","tags":null,"title":"Land Bank Stock Prices","type":"post"},{"authors":["Andres Acosta"],"categories":null,"content":"Even in our current society we see advertisements for products that do not always seem conventional. We might be walking through a store and see a product that is advertised to do great things for our health without using chemicals or anything unnatural. Some will advertise that they use natural herbs or minerals to get their results. This is not something unique to our time, they are actually the lasting remnants of patent pills from the past. These medicines have become less common because of efforts to regulate drugs, such as the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 and the creation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These actions made it illegal for these products to have misleading, fraudulent, overstated, or extravagant claims on their products without being able to back it up. The 1906 act just required these products to at least label what ingredients they were using and to accurately state what the medicines were doing but in 1936 the statute was revised. This revision banned all products that had misleading claims and caused these companies to overhaul their products with different ingredients, claims, or purposes in order to follow the law. Products like Coca-Cola, 7-up, Dr Pepper, Vicks Vaporub, and many more are current consumer products that evolved from patent medicines of the past.\nPatent Medicines, otherwise known as Nostrums, are medicines that are not considered effective because they are prepared by an unqualified person or company. They are usually highly advertised with creative claims in order to reel in customers. In the Egyptian Gazette, these advertisements were sometimes disguised as stories which then ended up turning into advertisements after catching readers’ attentions. The Picnic Girl is one of the many examples of clever advertising that patent medicines used in newspapers in order to slyly promote and sell their product.\nIn the Egyptian Gazette, there are many different occurrences of patent pill advertisements and this analysis will analyze the frequency of these advertisements throughout the publication, compare results of these occurrences to see which patent pills were the most successful, and lastly evaluate their longevity to see if it is positively correlated by their advertising frequency.\nIt seems that the total number of advertisements of patent medicines in the Egyptian Gazette declined as the year passed. The peaks occurred in January, March, and May of 1905 while the strongest dips were in February of both years, July of 1905, and a few other months in 1906. There seems to be a trend of slow decline throughout the two years but the month of February seems particularly odd since it is such a huge drop compared to the two months around it. According to the trend, February should have had around 5 total advertisements but instead it had none. The total then jumped back up to 3 in the immediately following month. The month of February in 1905 has a substantial amount of submissions (around 18) so a lack of postings does not seem to be the issue.\nAfter splitting up the patent pill mentions by company there are some obvious signs of market dominance. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People and Dr. Le Clerc’s Pills for the Liver each both had around double of the mentions as the other companies combined (12 and 11 to 6 and 1). However, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills was also dominant in the first few months and had as many mentions as the other top two medicines until the summer months of 1905 occurred. After this slump the company had no mentions for the rest of the two years.\nI researched Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and was surprised to notice that, despite their disappearance from the newspaper, they are still running strong. (Although with some branding and claim changes). I also researched Beecham’s pills because I was curious if the amount of advertisements a product had correlated with the product’s/company’s longevity. Beecham’s pills had the least mentions out of the 4 patent medicines in the newspaper, with only one article. However, their company transformed into the Beecham Group which was still running until 1989 when it then merged with another company (BBC). This long lifespan shows that longevity of the company and frequency of their product advertisements were not directly correlated.\nTowards the end of the analysis time period, Dr. William’s and Dr. Le Clerc’s pills seemed to both follow an identical pattern. Upon shifting the graph into a 3D version you can see that starting from August of 1905 the two companies had identical advertisement frequencies while the other two products seemed to flatline.\nThe two products had the same advertisement frequency from August of 1905 to the end of the analysis in October of 1906. This strikes me as odd and leads me to believe that these patterns might be caused because of submission errors. Shifting the graph to a 3D version also helped emphasize how rarely Beecham’s Pills were advertised compared to …","date":1492992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492992000,"objectID":"f47f9a73ccc392b4bae6174589e6670e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-acosta/","publishdate":"2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-acosta/","section":"post","summary":"Even in our current society we see advertisements for products that do not always seem conventional.

At first I didn’t know why it was so important but then continuing in the article published I could tell that Egypt lost an important life in the European Press of Egypt. He was known as the “Doyen of the Local Press” which means “the most prominent and respected person in a particular field”. This got me interested in this man’s life and accomplishments so I started to do some research on him.\nHaicalis earned a Doctorate of Law, was on many Governmental Administrations, was the one who persuaded Mr. Cook, the owner of Thos. Cook \u0026amp; Son tourist agency, an agency which if you have worked with the Egyptian Gazette I’m sure you have heard of, to come to Egypt to start his business. In my own opinion, his most important accomplishment was that he was a founder and the Editor of a newspaper called Phare d’Alexadrie. This paper was known for its “journalistic decency” and not blackmailing individuals, providing readers with just news.\nHe was honored in many countries for his work, receiving things like the Legion of Honor, the Order of the Crown of Italy, and many other decorations/honors. He was an important figure in the journalist community and impacted how European Press was constructed in delivering news from Egypt and inversely impacted the Egyptian Gazette. Even though this doesn’t impact everyday life ultimately in Egypt it still is a very saddening passing of someone who made positive changes to many things in the world.

I found a peculiar article in my week of March 1905 entitled “A Cairo Nuisance”. It was all about “donkey-boys” and how they harass residents of Cairo. Today, one would be hard-pressed to find someone in America who regularly sees donkeys, much less is harassed by their owners, so this subject interested me. The closet thing I could think of was people at the mall who stand at the kiosks and politely verbally accost you until you try their perfume samples. As the article indicates, there are already cabs in Cairo, so are the donkeys a fading form of transportation? Are they pets? What type of person owns them? The “Cairo Complainer” (a name I have given the anonymous Cairo resident who wrote the original article) seems to be of a status that is above donkeys. With so many questions, I was curious about their role in 1905/1906 Egypt, and wanted answers. This course focuses around micro history, which is using small facts and details found in primary sources and weaving them into a larger, big-picture look at history. In any history class, no professor spends a lecture on donkeys. At the same time, there were clearly donkeys in Egypt at the time; they were a part of the lives of the residents in Egypt. Despite their seemingly unremarkable role, they had a role nonetheless. Therefore, I found this subject to be perfect for a serial micro history investigation.\nSerial Question I realized that although my original article focused on the “donkey-boys”, it would be more fruitful to be slightly less specific and broaden my topic to be on the subject of donkeys in general. My goal is to learn exactly how donkeys were used and perceived by those living in Egypt at the time. It is unrealistic to think that every perspective of donkeys is present in the Egyptian Gazette, especially given the audience is French and English people living in the area at the time, so I arrived at the serial question “What is the role of donkeys in 1905/1906 Egypt as represented by the Egyptian Gazette?”.\nXPATH Query To practically answer this question, I needed to create an XML search query. This allows me to search all the issues of the newspaper that have been uploaded to our content repository on Github, effectively searching through every daily issue of the Egyptian Gazette from 1905 and 1906 that has been completed. An XML search basically needs two things… a WHERE, and a WHAT.\nWhat? My “what” was easy… donkeys. I knew that I need to try to find every reference to donkeys that I could. I realized that there is more than one word for donkey, but after some preliminary searching, I saw that the most common substitute turned up primarily the word “association”. It seemed like donkey was the term of the land for the creature.\nWhere? As discussed before, I needed to find every mention of donkeys that I could. I might find these mentions on page 2, 3, 4, anywhere. However, I knew that I wouldn’t find the references in a specific advertisement or table as many of my classmates would. Therefore, I made my search a general search for the word “donkey”. //p[contains(.,\u0026#34;donkey\u0026#34;)]\nHowever, XML searches are case sensitive. I still had one more search to do. //p[contains(.,”Donkey\u0026#34;)]\nI collected my results for the first query on Friday April 21st at 4:28 p.m. and the second query at 5:35 p.m. on Friday, April 21st. Then, I organized them by topic and formulated the results section of this paper.\nChallenges Not all of the articles were corrected perfectly from the OCR software, so I had to do some decoding to figure out what they were saying. Keeping this in mind, there could be other mentions of donkeys that I was not able to discover because someone failed to correct a misreading by their OCR software. Occasionally, I would come across a section that was improperly divided, or missing appropriate sections. For example, despite the word “donkey” being mentioned only once, I received a several different articles as results and had to sift through them to find the content I was searching for. In addition, on May 11th, 1906 and May 9th, 1906, the same articles were featured. I’m not sure if this is intentional, a mistake of the Gazette, or a mistake of a fellow transcriber.\nResults From the XPATH query, I found 41 mentions of the word “donkey”. In addition, I found 21 occurrences of the word with its first letter capitalized. Every article and the date can be found in the appendix of this paper [removed-Ed.]. There are not 41 entries in the appendix because sometime the word appeared more than once in an article that was a continuation of the same topic. As discussed in a previous section, I organized them by subject. There were a handful of articles that did not fit into any of the categories, such as the one-off use of the phrase “Donkey Tail Principle”, and in a mention of horse shows.

Victims of the plague had been reported dead in a number of villages.\nThe article states some, but not all, of the cases were said to be pneumonic, which means it affected the lungs. This creates a curiosity for me. If only the majority of the deaths were caused by pneumonia, I wonder if all of the people who died, were infected by the same disease. I am also curious if the disease affected different people in different ways. The article explicitly states that they deemed this plague to be contracted through direct contact. I am curious as to the origins of this plague and the characteristics and symptoms of it as well. I searched for outside information regarding this plague and this websiteexplains that this plague had affected other countries as well such as India, South America, and Europe.\nAdditionally, the article talks about improvements made in a village where numerous cases of the plague occurred as well as providing treatment to one infected patient that led to their cure. This proves that the medical professionals of Egypt were able to identify the disease and develop a treatment that helped cure at least one patient. This website explains how diseases were treated in ancient Egypt. People were still exposed to similar diseases that are found today, however, their treatment methods were much different. They used medicines and “magic” which referred to asking the gods for treatment. They also made their own medical remedies, many of which contained beer which was believed to have powerful curing effects. I am interested to know how they treated and cured the single patient.\nAdditionally, medical practices in ancient Egypt have a lasting effect on present methods. Through further research, this website went into detail on how treatments in ancient Egypt influenced treatments used today. For example, ancient Egyptian professionals used various herbs to create medicines to cure diseases and sicknesses. Many of these same remedies are still used today. Ancient medical practices were more advanced than I presumed. There is evidence that Egyptian doctors performed eye surgery, dentistry, used prosthetics, healed broken bones, and more. Many of their treatment and healing methods were published in books that are still being preserved today. It is interesting that medical practices used in ancient times are still being used in one way or another in modern times.\nA number of my classmates and students in the past also inquired questions regarding the plague. One student was also curious to know more about the plague, its origins, symptoms, and treatment. I searched through various blog posts that were written on the plague and noticed a trend. Multiple students were wondering why there was not much information on the plague. This student wrote about the small number of reports that were made about the plague. In my issue there was only one small article hidden on the third page. This makes me question how serious the disease was at the time and if it was something that either was not a major threat or if it was being hidden from the public. This is something I hope to learn more about as I continue working with my week.\nAs I continue to go through my week in this newspaper, I hope to find more information about this plague. I wonder if the number of deaths will decreases and if a fully effective cure is developed to prevent further infections.\n","date":1492905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492905600,"objectID":"f669368fcc2202e163852b4405ed1ab0","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-23-migdalski-plague/","publishdate":"2017-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-23-migdalski-plague/","section":"post","summary":"Origins, treatment, cure?","tags":["plague","death","treatment"],"title":"The Plague","type":"post"},{"authors":["Madison Flick"],"categories":null,"content":"In the early 20th century, in Alexandria, Egypt, many people died, but not everyone had a funeral. Of the funerals reported by the Egyptian Gazette, it turns out that not all of the funerals reported even took place in Alexandria. I am interested in why some people were lucky enough to have a funeral and why some funerals were mentioned in the newspaper even if it didn’t happen in Alexandria?\nMy original idea for this analysis was to just find out where most of these funerals were taking place. I wanted to see where they were being held to see if this could show if the Egyptian Gazette focused more on local events or foreign events. Soon after starting my research, my goal morphed into finding out not only where these funerals took place, but also whom these funerals were for. My question changed to include who the people are because I wanted to see if there was a certain “type” of person who had a funeral. So my goal in the end of this was to see if there was clearly a more common location for funerals and a specific type of person who had a funeral in 1905 and 1906 as reported by the Egyptian Gazette.\nI started my research by using the XPath Query //div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;funeral\u0026#39;)] to find all of the instances where the word “funeral” appears in the newspaper. The query brought up 158 results. I found that the easiest way to record my results would be to read through each one of these results to find which ones are actual funeral announcements and then I could record the name of the person and place of the funeral. After reading through each search result I realized that a few of the more popular funerals were reported on a couple of different times (before and after the actual funeral). Also, quite a few results weren’t actually funeral announcements and were actually articles about architecture, explaining that some buildings look like “funeral temples” or reporting on artifacts found that would be used in a funeral. Other times the word “funeral” was mentioned they were expense reports that stated how much the country either budgeted or spent on everything, including funeral expenses. Out of the 158 results, only 83 of these results were actually original funeral announcements. I could have simplified the process of manually collecting data by using the persName and placeName tags when executing my XPath Query to hopefully get all the names of the deceased and the location of their funerals in one easy search. In theory, this approach should be helpful, but after all of my manual data collection, I noticed that not many of the funeral announcements were encoded with the persName and placeName tags. So if all of my fellow collaborators had used these tags, yes this approach would be very helpful, but since not many did use these tags, including these tags in my XPath Query isn’t as helpful as it should be.\nAfter I found all of the funerals that were reported in the Egyptian Gazette, I decided to perform the XPath Query //div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;died\u0026#39;)] to find the number of times the newspaper reported a death. I wanted to see if the number of people who had funerals was the same as the number of people who had died. This significant difference in numbers can help prove that only certain people are having their funerals reported in the Egyptian Gazette. From this query, I got 337 results, but when I read through all of the results, I found that the newspaper actually reported 406 deaths.\nThere were many deaths reported by the Egyptian Gazette in 1905 and 1906, but only a small number of funerals reported in the newspaper. Out of the 406 deaths reported in the Egyptian Gazette, only 83 funerals were reported, which means only about 20% of the people who died actually had their funeral reported. The deaths that were reported included articles that recorded groups of anonymous people dying, such as multiple soldiers who died in a military accident, or multiple people dying from the plague at around the same time. When the funerals were reported, on the other hand, they reported on only one person at a time and named them specifically. Most of the funerals that were reported gave at least a sentence or two describing their lives and all of the people seemed to be somewhat well known people in Alexandria (or a family member of a well known person). An example of the death and funeral of a very important person in Alexandria is Dr. Haicalis Pasha, the “‘Editor-proprietor’ of the ‘Phare d’Alexandrie’”. Dr. Haicalis’ death and funeral was reported on three days in a row. His original death announcement labeled him as the “‘doyen’ of the Egyptian Press,” as well as named him as “his Excellency Dr. Haicalis Pasha.” It’s very clear that Dr. Haicalis was very important in Alexandria, at least to the writers at the Egyptian Gazette. It may seem like the person who wrote his obituary is a little biased towards Dr. Haicalis because he wrote for the Egyptian Gazette before he died, but it seems as though he actually was a very …","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"29a52276496657389585cfd36e081934","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-flick/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-flick/","section":"post","summary":"In the early 20th century, in Alexandria, Egypt, many people died, but not everyone had a funeral.

In this class, we studied several different issues in great detail between the years 1905- 1906, to get a feel for what life was like in Egypt at the turn of the century. There are many different important tables within the paper, which gives information about a variety of topics, ranging from telegram transfer times, to ferry passenger lists, to different stocks - all similar to what can be found today in a modern newspaper. In this class, we conduct a microhistory analysis. Microhistory is defined as an intensive historical investigation of an event, community, or individual. This class and analysis project can easily be defined as “Digital Microhistory”, as we spend a lot of time searching and digging through details to come up with an end result to a serial question that isn’t outright stated in the Egyptian Gazette.\nThe week that I was assigned to study and analyze was June 25 through June 30, 1906. A lot was happening at the time, including a massacre between townspeople and a British police force commonly referred to in the paper as the ‘Denishwai Affair’, and almost every issue that I read through and analyzed had some mention of details of the case, trial, and brutal crime that occurred. While most of the issues that were in my week only had six pages, about one-third of them had eight pages - both the Wednesday and Saturday issues. These issues in particular had more pages as they included more advertisements for local businesses than the typical issue, along with more news stories and typically, financial tables.\nIn my analysis specifically, I focused on a table that occurred in many, not all, of the issues of the Egyptian Gazette called “To-day’s Exchange Quotations.” This was essentially a table that showed the exchange rates between Egyptian currency with several countries from Europe, including Switzerland and Germany, in addition to several major European cities such as London, Paris, and Vienna. My main goal of this analysis was to see if there was a difference between exchange rates during different times of the year, or if any events such as the Denishwai Affair affected these rates. It gives the impression that there were many travelers from these countries included in the table. This table was most likely useful to visitors of Egypt who need to convert their money from one nation’s currency to the next.\nI started my analysis with an XPath Query, //div[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-el-tdeq01\u0026#34;]//table//row[2]//cell//measure, which yielded the results of exchange rates for the “London Cheque”. In order to find all results, I had to repeat this query, but change the number of the row that the Oxygen XML Editor was searching within amongst the many issues. There were a total of twelve rows, so there were 12 individual XPath queries that I had to conduct. There were 176 total results from each XPath Query. The easiest way for me to record the values given to me as a result of the query was to copy the values of exchange into a spreadsheet on excel. When analyzing the results of my query, I saw that many of the values hadn’t changed much at all over the span of two years, from 1905-1906. This leaves me with an impression that the currency in Europe, as well as Egypt, was pretty strong and stable at the turn of the 20th century.\nIn the table “To-day’s Exchange Quotations”, there are many different rows of information. These included both banks’s buying and selling rates for London Cheque (3m. bank and house paper), Paris Cheque (3m. bank and house paper), Switzerland 3m. bank paper, Germany Cheque (3m. bank paper), Italian Cheque, Vienna and Trieste Cheque, and Constantinople cheque. The exchange rates differ considerable from country to country, due to the different value of each currency. Based on my research and analysis, the stronger one currency is in comparison to another, it takes less to purchase another currency, and vice versa. The two most expensive currencies were the Germany Cheque and Switzerland Cheque, as they both sold and could be purchased for about 475 Egyptian pounds. The most similar to the Egyptian currency was that of the London Cheque, as the average buying and selling price was 96 2/5, and 97 57/73 respectively. I also needed to discover what exactly the difference was between “house paper” and “bank paper”, as some of the listed currencies above had these distinguished variations. I found that “bank paper” is similar to what is nowadays called “commercial paper”, which is involved more in investments and credit. “House paper” most likely was just cash or everyday spending money that the Egyptian people had at the time.\nFor the visualization part of this project, my original idea was to use the Tableau program to create a map, and on the different cities or countries …","date":1492646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492646400,"objectID":"ef9e9076134faa22e14959391f62347e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-pearce/","publishdate":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-pearce/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette is a typical daily newspaper that not only gives the news that occurs around Egypt, but provides advertisements for local businesses in addition to other stories about what is going on in the world.","tags":null,"title":"Turn of the Century Exchange Rates","type":"post"},{"authors":["Quin Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"I started searching for information on St. Petersburg by putting in the XPath query //head[contains(.,\u0026#34;st.petersburg\u0026#34;)].

To find results with both St. Petersburg and war I changed my XPath query to //head[contains(.,“St. Petersburg”)]//p[contains(.,“war”)]. I did not find any results with this query so I then went through articles containing St. Petersburg looking for important information. I found that in many articles involving St. Petersburg acts of violence and Russia are mentioned. For example, on February 10, 1905, an article titled “CONDITION OF RUSSIA. WARSAW HOSPITALS FULL. PROBABLE RESUMPTION OF STRIKE,” talks about the number of people from St. Petersburg killed at Warsaw. The casualties did not exceed 100 people, however people were angered by their loss and many had planned to preform a strike on the following Sunday. This article also addresses the frequency of these strikes throughout Russia. The paper states that these strikes happen often, so I decided to look into strikes in St. Petersburg.\nOverall the striking was talked about mostly in the month of February. It is mentioned again on the next day’s newspaper in February and then constantly after that. From what I can tell, these strikes were a result of people’s frustrations with the war. In February 20, 1905’s paper it states that on February 18, 1905’s St. Petersburg was dealing with an even worse strike. “The strike here is again rapidly extending. 30,000 men have rejoined the strikers, whose temper is now more threatening than during the previous period.” (page 2)\nPeople proactively try to solve the strike problem in March of 1905. This first meeting workers were allowed to attend about this was held in St. Petersburg. This meeting involved 200 electors. The job of these electors was to represent the workers. According to an article titled “MEETING OF WORKMEN,”(1905-03-03 page 3) “the electors refused to carry out their task unless 3,000 workmen, who had been arrested since the 22nd January last, were immediately released, and that other demands, including the inviolability of person and domicile, together with freedom of speech and press, were granted.” All of these demands and strikes cause an overall sense of unrest in Russia and the paper even refers to this time as having an “epidemic of strikes.” Again in March these workers meet and it is decided that their demands need to be met soon. The paper notes that many people are worried of disorder on the anniversary of the liberation of the serfs happening the next weekend. On March 4th it is noted that, “The Strikes have increased here. 51000 strikers are now out. Yesterday passed quietly.”(1905-03-06 page 2)\nDespite the increasing amount of unhappy workers, on March 7, 1905 the Tsar orders that the labor commission with the representatives be closed. On March 9, 1905 another report on striking appears in relation to the men of the Baltic Navel dockyard in St. Petersburg. This leads to the arrest of their elected representatives.\nIn April of 1905 two thousand strikers were preventing comrades from resuming work at the Putiloff workshops. Police shot at these strikers until they dispersed. Then they all stood together in a specific area that was strongly patrolled. After this incident, not many more articles address the strikes caused by war. I’m not sure if this is because people started focusing on the more news worthy war or if people began to give up on their demands.\nOverall, the strikers in St. Petersburg and their struggles reported in the newspaper act as a cultural comparison with our current society. I find it odd in general how the people had a problem, the government recognized this problem and formed a plan to solve it, then the Tsar disbanded the whole group working to solve the problem. This makes no sense to me because I have grown up in a democracy with representation. The way these strikes are handled in 1905 is so different than how they would be handled now. Also shooting on citizens protesting would be unheard of now and in the United States of America, but then it was written about in the paper one time and then not mentioned again until July 3, 1905. Did this issue resolve itself, or did the government just instruct the newspapers to no longer report on it? It seems odd to me that a whole shooting is reported on so vaguely and quickly. I believe the people in charge of the government might have forced the paper to stop reporting on strikes in order to prevent it from becoming supportive propaganda for the strikers.\nAfter this incident, strikers are mentioned as whole more often and never specified as a specific group striking in St. Petersburg.

The goal of this analysis project is to investigate how the Egyptian Gazette reported on anarchist movements and activity and how it relates specifically to the British and their control of Egypt. This question is important because during the time period leading up to World War 1, colonialism was still a thriving policy for European governments. Wars between European powers were still being fought over foreign land in Asia and Africa. Anarchists laid the foundation for anti-colonial revolutions after the first and second World Wars. European states were able to point to anarchists as enemies of the state, similar to communists during the Cold War. The Gazette gives a unique view of what Europeans living within the British colony of Egypt would be thinking at the time of such upheaval. I chose this topic primarily to explore my curiosity of anarchism as an ideology but also to prove how Anarchism in one side of Europe can affect the policies of the whole continent, as well as neighboring regions. While doing research for this analysis project, it also gave me the chance to read articles by a specific person whose teachings I respect.\nMy research has shown that the reporting done in the Egyptian Gazette promotes the fear of anarchy throughout Europe and its colonies. I struggled while conducting my research in The Egyptian Gazette. Primarily, the task of connecting the various forms of anarchism that were mentioned within the newspaper was difficult. There are various contexts in which anarchism is mentioned within the newspaper, most of which do not involve Egypt or Great Britain. The newspaper mentions anarchy in the context of peasant revolutions in the Baltic regions, assassinations against the Spanish monarch, as well as the state of the Russian government during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. There are a few instances where Egypt is directly mentioned such as the anarchist, Francesco Blandini, who was banned from Egypt and wanted in Italy. However, these events mentioned within the Egyptian Gazette are being read by Europeans doing business within the colony. It effects how they view the state of the world and creates a sense of danger. Anarchism can threaten the survival of the state itself, such as how the Egyptian Gazette reported about the Russian tsar in early 1905. Anarchy was feared throughout Europe as an ideology that possessed the power to overthrow not only the colonial system but also the primary state itself. To the British, anarchism is dangerous because it can unravel their control of Egypt and create mayhem in a similar way that armed peasants in the Baltics did. An anarchist uprising could spark within the Egyptian peasantry and potentially abolish Britain’s presence in the land. At the time, Egypt was one of Britain’s most valuable colonies, alongside India. The Egyptian Gazette mirrors what a British businessman with investments in Egypt would be thinking during the time. They would pay special attention to the few articles that reference anarchism because they had a fear it would spread.\nMy search for the keyword “anarchism” in The Egyptian Gazette began with an article I read in the June 4, 1906 edition of the paper. It was about an anarchist by the name of Matteo Moral, who was being hunted for the attempted assassination of the King Alfonso of Spain. There were only a few more mentions of anarchism within that edition of the paper so I began doing XPath searches for the terms: anarchy, anarchist, and anarchism. I received a total of twenty four instances where the three terms were mentioned. However, I did not receive any results for the term anarchism. After collecting a list of when the two terms were used, I organized the data into a spreadsheet. I organized the data by counting how many times a specific region was mentioned in reference to anarchy. It appears that Russia was mentioned the most out of any other region, with most regions only being mentioned a few times. For example, Russia was mentioned a total of eight times while Crete was only mentioned once. It makes sense that Russia is mentioned the most due to the political unrest and revolution that occurred in Russia during 1905.\nAnother issues that came up was that there are a few instances where the term anarchy comes up in articles but the author was not referring to the ideology or a revolution. There are three times anarchy is mentioned that are outliers to the rest of the data set. Although they mention a specific region, the word anarchy is not used in the context of war. In the case of the outliers, anarchy was used to describe the state of an unmanageable situation. For example, there is an article in the September 6, 1906 edition of the newspaper that talks about stock markets being in a state of anarchy. Although it …","date":1492387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492387200,"objectID":"e511f765c27a25db6edfc8505384e301","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-ortiz/","publishdate":"2017-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-ortiz/","section":"post","summary":"Prior to the Red Scare and the rise of Communism throughout Europe, Anarchism was the ideology that posed the highest threat to European states as well as their respective colonial governments.","tags":null,"title":"Anarchism in Colonial Egypt","type":"post"},{"authors":["Diana Fajardo"],"categories":null,"content":"The Egyptian Gazette is one of the most remarkable newspaper developed in Egypt that has informed and entertained the community for centuries. The newspaper was the main source of information for members of the community, as it was filled with short stories, financial tables, advertisements, and records of sports. In order to find material for my research, I used //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;insertword\u0026#39;)] as my search query. As shown in the table below, I ran results for search words including Bubonic, plague, cattle, and diseases. The results for plague were high–131 items–and low for Bubonic–17 items.\nIn order to improve the quality of my research, I decided to specifically target the Bubonic Plague. As death caused by plagues were repeatedly mentioned in my assigned week, the topic appeared numerous time through my classmates’ XML document.\nThe table below depicts how the result of deaths caused by the Bubonic Plague changes drastically in different cities. Cities that were affected by the plague include: Alexandria, Port Said, Sues, Zifta, and Damanhur. Because of the difference in casualties between the cities, I decided to investigate what may have been the underlaying promotion of the Bubonic Plague in the affected cities. By combining my curiosity for the Bubonic Plague and the sanity conditions of affected cities, my serial question developed into “How the sanitary conditions of the cities may have promoted the Bubonic plague in different cities.”\nAs I began my research, I had to set the foundation of my project by adapting my Oxygen XML editor to the standard XPath and XQuery language. Fortunately, Mr. Reddick (the teacher assistant) was kind enough to help students such as myself, who are not familiar with the process. After the software was ready, I was able to search a number of XPath queries with different terms. However, the process included a series of trial and error. For instance, I noticed that the query, //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;bubonic \u0026#39;)], resulted with only one item, while the query, //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;bubonic\u0026#39;)] resulted with sixteen items. Because of the successful results, I ultimately used this template for my XPath queries: //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;insertword\u0026#39;)]. In order to find quality information regarding of the Bubonic Plague, the main search query used was //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39; Bubonic \u0026#39;)].\nA barrier I encountered was that there were short articles appearing in the results or the article regarding about a plague was hidden among other articles. Compared to recurring data in the newspaper, the death counts from the Bubonic Plague were written in articles rather than recorded in tables. As a researcher, it was frustrating not having a tool that would allow me to quickly input data in the Atom software or Windows Excel. However, it would be morally wrong to simply remember the victims of the Bubonic Plague as data; for that reason, the victims were mentioned in articles could be remembered as individuals rather than as simple numbers. Shown below is a graph from the collection of data from the beginning of January 1905 to the end of April 1906.\nAs shown above, the city that was heavy affected by the Bubonic Plague was Alexandria, followed by Suez. The data contrasted my original presumption (Alexandria would be least affected by the plague), since it was a very attractive city to tourists. However, I realized how my assumption did not consider actual factors of the city’s condition. If a city or town is widely known and attracts numerous individuals, then the population will drastically increase since citizens will move to seek jobs. If a town is unknown and does not attract many businesses, then the population will be significantly low compared to a city’s. As citizens of Egypt flock to Alexandria, many would live in uncomfortable and unsanitary conditions since space was limited and many cannot afford a standard household. Since Alexandria had a large population, it was difficult to enforce sanitary laws. As individuals disregard sanitary laws to minimize diseases, the Bubonic Plague may have easily infected citizens since many individuals worked in close proximitiy and the disease could have easily been transmitted. However, the table below will depict how by the end of October, the Bubonic Plague was essentially gone. Since this became the case, I developed a new search query in order to answer how the government was able to control the plague and cure the victims.\nIn order to find valid information regarding how the disregard of sanitary conditions promoted the Bubonic Plague and how the Sanitary Department helped eliminate the Bubonic Plague , I search a query as //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39; Sanitary \u0026#39;)]. Unfortunately, 271 items appeared as my result. To find information that specify targeted the Sanitary Department, I had to use a specific word choice.

In Egypt tourism became a vital part of the Egyptian economy after the construction of the Suez Canal had been completed. The hotels included in my results are all along the Nile River and the opening of the Suez canal made it much easier for people to get in and out of Egypt from around the world.\n“During the second half of the nineteenth century, a new system had emerged, one that would subsequently be applied to Egypt and Sudan.

Finding the query that would give me the answers that I wanted took me a long time. I initially asked myself where I would be able to find hotels in Cairo within the Digital Gazette. The answer that I came up was in the advertisements section, Local and General, and the Social sections of the issues. I began by trying to run the query //div[@type=\u0026#34;advert\u0026#34;] that would give me the titles of all of the hotels within the advertisements section. This was unsuccessful because the query was not answering my question of what the most common hotels in Cairo were. The query that I was running was not specific enough toward the location and gave far too many results to decipher. The next query I began to run was specific, however it was far too specific when trying to answer my questions because it did not give me any results. Many of the queries I tried to run failed because some of the results were in element or feature, which made it hard to find a full set of data. The biggest issue that I ran into was being specific enough to generate a query, but not too specific where I would get a small number of results. After trial and error, I was able to finally retrieve the query Query: //div[@type=\u0026#34;advert\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#34;Cairo”)]/head with the text finding the word hotel. This query finds an advertisement that contains the word Cairo in the head and hotel somewhere in the text. This query is not perfect, however it did assist me in answering the question that I posed.\nThe query that I was able to retrieve for the hotels answered my question of what hotels in Cairo existed in Colonial Egypt, however this query still did not give me an accurate representation of the people who attended these hotels. I further had to construe a query that would answer the question of who visited the hotels and when the people visited these hotels. When coming up with a query to answer this question, I discovered the element: “visitList”. When making a query for visitList, this was difficult because I wanted to make the results specific, yet attainable. I began with the query of Query: //div[@element=\u0026#34;visitList\u0026#34;], this query gave me results that stated yes, meaning that that there was a visitList element in the issue. I needed to make the element much more specific. I generated the query //div[@element=\u0026#34;visitList\u0026#34;//persName]. This did not give me results as it still was not specific enough. I generated results to find persName within the visitList attribute with using regular expression \\W\\w+ \\W\\w+. This regular expression would give me the results for people within the visitList that were tagged with persName. The results for this test came up for me, however many people that coded for the Egyptian Gazette in XPath did not use this tag. I generated results for only a couple of dates.\nVisitors in Cairo Egypt in 1905\nThe strengths that I found with using Xpath and generating results using regular expression were that it was able to find a specific answer for me if I asked it the right question, however if I asked the right question some of the results would not populate if others did not put on their end the same exact XML markdown.\nReferences When thinking about a topic such as hotels in Egypt, it is important to find scholarly reviewed text for a more accurate understanding of the topic at hand. I was able to find three articles to assist me in answering the question about tourism and hotels within Cairo.THE THOMAS COOK ARCHIVE FOR THE STUDY OF TOURISM IN NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST explains how tourism in the Middle East and North Africa took a dramatic incline during the 1880s. The essay details how “Mass tourism is synonymous with the name of Thomas Cook and Son Ltd.” Thomas Cook and Son Ltd. helped pave the way for tourist coming in and out of Egypt after they developed “the Nile transit service while simultaneously opening up Syria/Palestine to travelers.” This information is important because it explains why the hotels included in this visualization were popular during their prime.

The title, “FATE OF 6,000 BIRDS” and to summarize the article briefly, after two nights of thick fog, nearly 6,000 birds were found dead under a lighthouse. They were attracted to the light in the fog and flew right against it. (The full article can be found in Page 4 of the Monday, December 18, 1905 issue of the Egyptian Gazette.) Not much else is mentioned in the article, it is a rather brief memorial. This struck me as being a unique article so I decided to share it. I did a quick search on the location of the lighthouse, “Cape Grisnez” and turns out this story takes place in France! Cape Grisnez is in northern France between Wissant and Audresselles. The cape held place to a naval battle during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805, and also would play a historical role in World War II. The lighthouse was built in 1837, originally standing 46 feet tall. In 1861, the lighthouse was raised to 79 feet tall.\nReading articles from the past makes the research more interesting, you read it from the perspective of the time frame it was written, but when investigating further you get a full picture that spans past the newspaper and through to present day.

Upon further research, it was discovered that gum was not actually an ingredient in making food, unlike of modern day chewing gum. After this was realized another question that was raised was, how important Gum was to the international trade of Egypt. By using the xpath Query //p[contains(.,\u0026#34;gum \u0026#34;)] it was easy to see that Gum was mentioned in the newspaper quite a lot in 1905 but not as much as in 1906. A lot of the times that gum is mentioned, it is mentioned with numbers of kilograms that was traded back and forth from mostly England, but also a lot of other various places. This is a very interesting topic because it shows the readers where gum is used and how much it is used in each country. It can also be seen in the newspaper that there was even some competition between certain companies, as well as different exports. This can also be investigated. It would be interesting to see which export was most important to Egypt, as well as how much Egypt imported each of their products. After realizing this, it was decided that this would be a good topic to research more because it could possibly be useful for discovering some secrets about cooking or taste changes. Even though this might not be the most useful, it is relatively interesting. From the data, it can be easily seen that the exports of gum increases drastically throughout the year. At one point in 1904, the exports of gum increased by over one million pounds. This is perhaps due to the fact that more and more people will want to have access to this interesting product, or maybe the fact that the word is out that Egypt’s arabic gum is the best around. Another interesting point in this research that was found was that there was even gum being exported to America. Seventy cantars were exported in the year up to July in 1906.\nXPath As stated above, the query //p[contains(.,\u0026#34;gum \u0026#34;)] was used in order to find out the data needed for this analysis. This was the best query that could be used because it gave plenty of varied results from a variety of dates from 1905. If another query was used, there would not be as much useable data that would be important in finding results that could be helpful for this analysis. Other queries were attempted, but not nearly as many results came up, especially not as much useful information.\nWhy is this important? The idea of researching Gum in this analysis is important to understand what certain crops and goods were used for. By looking at this, the reader of the newspaper is able to see that gum was an important part of Egypt’s exports. Without this arabic gum, their trade exports would most likely be a lot less than what it was. In regards to the historical aspects of arabic gum, it is important to look at this because the basic aspects of life can be discovered and researched. This ties into the social aspects of microhistory. It is important to look at every piece of the amount of time that is being researched. The idea of looking at gum is important because people can look at what the Egyptians back then were eating, or doing with arabic gum. Arabic gum is an interesting topic because it was used for a few different things back in 1905-1906 that were very interesting and important in looking at the whole story of trade in Egypt, as well as the social aspects of life back then. Some might say that this small piece of evidence is not important at all in identifying the big picture. This may be true, but based on the fact that Egypt was a rising power, especially in the middle east, it is crucial that historians know as much as possible about what the Egyptian Government was doing. They need to know everything from how they treated their people, to what the exported and imported, and how much they made from it. It is also important to see where this product is going. From the research that was completed, it was seen that a lot of the trade was done in Africa, on the Sudan trade line, but also throughout the Mediterranean Sea, and even up in to England.\nReflections A major portion of the data that was found by using this query was text. They were discussing the difficulties of the Gum trade, or they were speaking about competition within companies, or even just speaking about the idea of the gum trade in general. However, the data in numbers that was found was useful in determining how much of the gum was exported, when it was exported and sometimes where it was going.\nSome difficulties of using digital methods to research this microhistory were the fact that some of the data pulled from the Digital Egyptian Gazette was skewed. Some of the data remained unchanged, as well as had typos that could skew the data at some points.

Acquiring this section of the data required two X-Path queries as follows- //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr01\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#34;Min. Temp in the shade\u0026#34;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number() and //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr01\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#34;Max. Temp in the shade\u0026#34;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number(). These gave me both sets of temperatures for Alexandra, the maximum and minimum.\nAll other data was gathered from the “Other Stations” table, as each location reporting data corresponds to a weather station in Egypt. For these stations I used a similar query to the one used for Alexandria, just with a different xml:id. These were all some variation of //table[@xml:id=\u0026#34;deg-ta-dawr02\u0026#34;]//cell[contains(.,\u0026#34;Port Said\u0026#34;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number(). I manipulated this query, changing the [contains(.,\u0026#34;-\u0026#34;)] to different station names, also using both cell[1] and cell[2] to obtain the maximum temperature values as well as the minimum.\nWhy temperature? Analyzing and observing the variations in temperature reported in the Egyptian Gazette may be relatively boring on its own, but the applications of such a query are boundless. The weather in cities affects a huge number of variables from tourism to cotton prices. My own analysis project only focuses on temperature because the area alone has not been explored in depth before. I wanted to fill a hole of information as well as to provide some preliminary analysis/data compilation for future analysts of the Egyptian Gazette who may be interested in the effects of temperature on some other phenomenon, but don’t necessarily want to spend the time compiling and organizing such a large amount of raw data.\nThe Data All data is what was updated as of noon on April 12th for the purposes of being able to clean up data and create visualizations before continuing the project. For each location, for both the maximum and minimum temperature, I removed the data that was the same as the template data. The incomplete data (i.e. data that was copy and pasted from the template but not updated with the data from the contributor’s week) was more common in the “Other Stations” chart than in the Alexandria temperatures. A few days also appear to not contain an “Other Stations” table at all, so Alexandria Station has a good deal more data than the other locations, making the averages more accurate than any other station included.\nThese are the monthly average temperatures in some of the stations reported in the Daily Weather Report during 1905 and 1906. I chose the seven that are included because they were contained in the most editions of the Egyptian Gazette and actually contained data the most often. There were a few excluded from my data analysis because they were either only included in a smaller portion of the newspapers or contained too much null data to be at all useful.\nAs you can see in the graph, there are a few months which contain no data for one or many locations. The limitations of the data are such that the month of October in 1905 only has one day of the newspaper containing a daily weather report with the proper xml:id, and so only returned one piece of data for every location. The average for that month, therefore, is only one number. This single day had no recorded data for the Cairo Halouan station, and so one missing number results in an entire month missing from our visualization. The entire month of January in 1906 is also missing for every station except for Alexandria; this month also was an average of only one day, and that day of the newspaper did not contain the “Other Stations” chart at all.\nThe same gap in data for the maximum temperatures in January 1906 exists for the minimum, breaking up the data for all stations other than Alexandria. Both Port Said and Suakin stations have similar gaps in data for August 1906 because of data limitations- there are only two days of data for October.\nConclusions Speaking to the accuracy of this data, the only other source I could locate that had records of temperatures in Egypt in 1905/1906 was the NOAA Library of Records. Annual Meteorological reports on Egypt are available in pdf form; linked here is 1905 and 1906. It appears from their reports that August of 1905 was the hottest month, while the data from the Egyptian Gazette suggests that October had the highest temperatures. It should be noted that the reports from the NOAA library are from the Helwan Observatory, located in Cairo, Egypt. We would expect the reported temperatures in these annual reports to then reflect most closely to the Cairo station, Ghizeh and Halouan. In general, the data from the Egyptian Gazette seems to line up with that from the Helwan Observatory reports.

After being confronted by a police officer, Moral killed the officer. Shortly after, to evade capture, he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. Alongside Moral, an English tourist named Hamilton was also arrested under the charges of being an anarchist. The article does not state any more details about Hamilton’s arrest other than the Spanish authority refused to release him to the British.\nIt is interesting that the assassination attempt happened in Spain but it is being reported on by the Egyptian Gazette in British Egypt. Why is anarchist activity important to the British? Before communism was the boogeyman of Europe, anarchism seemed to be the ideology that was branded the enemy of the state. A year prior to this assassination attempt, the Russian state was under threat of “anarchy” during the Russo-Japanese War. That was also reported by the Egyptian Gazette in an article called “IS IT PEACE” which can be located in the June 1, 1906 edition on page two. Anarchism was an ideology that threatened the state was a whole. In an age where the state extended its power through colonial empires, anarchism threatened to dismantle the colonial system by weakening the state. To Great Britain, tracking anarchist activities of competing empires is important because it is a way to evaluate how strong the enemy central state is.\nFor more general information and history on anarchism as an ideology, feel free to read Noam Chomsky’s article, “A Brief History of Anarchism”.\n","date":1491868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491868800,"objectID":"a1166e2b416d6871072a6e446b823b4d","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-11-ortiz-russian-anarchy/","publishdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-11-ortiz-russian-anarchy/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette is reporting on anarchist activity but why is that important to British Egypt?","tags":["anarchy","colonialism","Russia","tsar,","Japan"],"title":"Why is anarchy important in British Egypt?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Katherine Ferguson"],"categories":null,"content":" Source: North Carolina Sanitary Engineering Division. 1955. Mosquitoes, and their control\nDisease ran rampant in Egypt during the early 20th century due to a lack of education concerning proper mosquito repellent techniques. Malaria and Yellow Fever were among the greatest threats to human health mainly because citizens refused to believe that mosquitos could not only spread disease, but also cause it. At this time the Yellow Fever epidemic was coming to an end in America, however Malaria in Egypt was barely being addressed, much less eradicated.\nIn order to create a better understanding of mosquito control efforts in 1905-1906, I have written an XPath Query that has searched the Egyptian Gazette Newspaper Catalogue throughout 1905 and 1906. The XPath Query //div[@type=\u0026#34;section\u0026#34;]/div/p[contains(., \u0026#39;mosquitoes\u0026#39;)] returned approximately 22 results, of which only 3 were vital to this analysis project. Many queries require a ‘Where’ component, but since mosquitoes were barely spoken of in these issues, if I were to include a specific section or page for XPath to look for, my results would have amounted to zero. To introduce mosquito/disease prophylaxis, as well as the context in which the yellow fever and malaria epidemic was raging, I have included a quotation taken from a concerned reader who wrote to the editor:\nThe mayor has issued a proclamation, approved by the State Board and the United States Public Health Service which requires all citizens to allow no stagnant water on their premises; to screen all cisterns after treating the surface with oil; to place oil in cesspools and privy vaults; to sleep under nets; and to screen doors and windows. The Egyptian Sanitary Department ought to issue similar instructions, for not one in a thousand of the people know how dangerous the mosquito is to health.”\n-Issue: 1905-12-11 (Line 1766)\nSome have tried to encourage the use of mosquito repellents and nets, and to declare war against the mosquito, however the effects have not been widespread. Cities were prophylaxis were employed had a great decrease in disease outbreaks, but the areas surrounding had an increase in deaths due to disease. “From the Federated Malay States there has been published by Dr. Watson shows that in these towns, whilst the number of deaths has been greatly reduced, increase has taken place in the district around, where no anti-malarial operation were undertaken.”, (Issue: 1905-12-04, Line: 2023).\nDichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane or DDT was originally synthesized in 1874, but was not recognized for its insecticidal properties until 1939. Thus while mosquitoes were just beginning to be identified by Egyptians as vectors for disease, Americans were years ahead in their fight against mosquitoes.\nMore information is needed on this topic, it was extremely difficult to collect data on mosquitoes in Egypt. Most historical data had to be gathered from Centers of Disease Control- Malaria website, while the cultural and social opinion of mosquito born disease was found in the Egyptian Gazette. The Egyptian Gazette provides raw data that is without contextual information, hence only small parts are useful to this analysis project. Web sites, on the other hand, take information from multiple different sources and provide a more complete historical picture. It is important to denote historical advances in medicine and technology in order to help advance present day medicine. The digitization of historical documents is especially important in developing countries, for these countries did not have the resources to immortalize their data as we in America did. For example, if one Google searches “Malaria in America” a plethora of information, pictures, anecdotes, and other historical documents are presented, but Google searching “Malaria in Egypt” presents the viewer with fewer than 10 websites to collect data from. Digitized versions of smaller countries’ historical works is vital to the public domain for research. The public domain is missing decades of documented societal progression in most of the countries around the world.\nWorks Cited CDC - Malaria - About Malaria - History.\n","date":1491782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491782400,"objectID":"0df9471748379246a683f58c2f12a056","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-ferguson/","publishdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/17-analysis-ferguson/","section":"post","summary":"Source: North Carolina Sanitary Engineering Division. 1955.

The article is basically a summary of two authors, Dr. William Libbey and Dr. Franklin E. Hoskins, and their account of traveling through the area. In the article they labeled Petra “a city old as time itself” and made it clear that tourists were rarely welcomed until these two authors spent a surprising five days in the city without molestation.\nThey described Petra as a rose red city that was in possession of some worthwhile monuments. Upon further research, I found images of the city that proved these claims to be true. I also found that the direct translation of Petra, from Greek to English, is ‘Rock’. It is a city that is surrounded by red stone, common to the geography of Jordan, and what makes the monuments worthwhile is that they carved into the red stone that comprises the area. These iconic monuments can be seen in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”\nHowever, my interest is not in the aesthetic of Petra, but rather the financial prosperity it offered in terms of its geography. According to the national Petra foundation, Petra was ideally placed on what is known today as the The King’s Highway in Jordan. This is significant because the Highway lies on a natural fault line, which made the city easily found by traders. I would like to inquire what economic benefit Petra offered Egypt and its people in 1906.\n##sources\nOutside Links: http://www.robertfulford.com/petra.html http://www.smithsonianmag.com/lifelists/guarding-petra-11031077/\nBlog Post Links: https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/doublemurder/ https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Egyptology/\n","date":1491609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491609600,"objectID":"9904d86588297e53dc483152165cf9d7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-08-fricano-petra/","publishdate":"2017-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-08-fricano-petra/","section":"post","summary":"One liner","tags":["petra"],"title":"Petra","type":"post"},{"authors":["Olivia Hammermaster"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"People make careless remarks all the time, especially public figures who then regret what they said. Egyptian royalty in 1906 was no different. The Wednesday, January 31st issue devotes an entire column to the Princess Nazli to allow her to make a statement refuting a comment she had made the previous Saturday. This comment consisted of her saying Egyptians were babies and Lord Cromer “did everything.” The editor of Al Mokattam, Dr. Nimr, jumped on this statement and asked the princess if she had adopted the French nationality instead. Princess Nazli then defends herself with the response that she has no desire to change her nationality, but still defends her words. She was a very educated woman, which was uncharacteristic of that society, who had good experience with other cultures, so she knew how to defend herself. She claims that the translation in the newspaper was correct and stands by what she says, praising Lord Cromer. Princess Nazli had a very involved family, many of whom were of different nationalities. Although she spends the beginning of her statement defending herself as an Ottoman subject, she seems to spend a lot of time talking about Lord Cromer and her father’s influence, seemingly as a distracting tactic to get off topic. Toward the end of her statement, she revisits the original issue: what she claims as her nationality. Princess Nazli almost seems to attack her critics, asking a series of questions regarding why her nationality was being challenged. The politicians of today use all these same tactics. They make it seem like they address a question while really discussing something else, then turn the conversation around to make themselves look better.

On the 15th of May, 1906, in particular, it outlined the activities of the Khedive for the day as well as the rest of the summer. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Egypt, the Khedive was the reigning governor of the land, who carried out both the responsibilities of being in charge of Egypt as a nation as well as diplomacy with other nations, such as Turkey, with which there had been a recent crisis (Donald M. Mckale (1997) “Influence without power: the last Khedive of Egypt and the great powers, 1914–18,” Middle Eastern Studies 33:1, 20-39). Known as the Ottoman Empire back then, Turkey played a huge role in how Egypt functioned. But an incident with the Sultan resulted in a cut in communications between the two nations. Communication between nations is crucial, as seen from the past and the present, and is paramount in resolving conflicts or delineating a nation’s state of being. However, the British soon took control of Egypt as a colony and also took it upon themselves to conquest Sudan as well (Winston S. Churchill, The River War: An Historical Account of the Reconquest of the Soudan (1899)). Towards the year 1914 and the approach of World War I, Great Britain had decided to end the Khediviate rule of Egypt and establish the Sultanate of Egypt, which would culminate with the Treaty of Peace with Turkey Signed at Lausanne, July 24, 1923.\n","date":1491264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491264000,"objectID":"fd752ecced72e657e3a31bbe5b246e54","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-04-ng-how-the-khedive-spends-his-time/","publishdate":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-04-04-ng-how-the-khedive-spends-his-time/","section":"post","summary":"The activities of the Khedive as described by The Egyptian Gazette","tags":["khedive","daily update"],"title":"How the Khedive Spends His Time","type":"post"},{"authors":["Sabrina Nunez"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"To begin, the name Icilma came from combining the Arabic words ‘icil’ meaning flows and ‘mha’ meaning water.

Originally wanting to open a spa near the spring, Stephen was moving from city to city trying to sell this mineral water in any way possible. He moved from Algeria to Paris and later growing his product in London. Finally settling in London, he established the business “Nature’s Remedy Company” where he not only worked as a chemist, but also built the machinery that went on to create Icilma cream. Icilma cream then transitioned into Icilma Flour cream due to the Calcium fluoride present in the water. It was later known and advertised as ‘Nature’s Skin Food’.

One very historical event in Egypt took place around this time - the Denshiwai Affair. On June 26, 1906, a lot of the information being released showed how the criminal trial was beginning to unfold. The trial took place in the Denshiwai village inside of Chibin el Kom, Egypt. A bad attack occurred between rebels and officers of the police force. There was a lineup of prisoners and witnesses who could speak and defend themselves, fairly similar to that of a modern day court system. It’s crazy to think how little the judicial system varies from country to country, especially over 100 years apart, when comparing it to the modern day American system. This seems almost similar to the current Black Lives Matter movements that have occurred across the United States in recent years, as police are being beaten and attacked along with people in the streets. It is interesting how closely history repeats itself.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, June 28 and 29, 1906, respectively, the final information was reviewed and the sentences were given. The death penalty is decided as one of the most level-headed punishments for the offenders.\n“Sentence of death was passed on the four following prisoners:\nHassan Mahfouz (11) Youssef Hassan Salim (14) Said Issa Salim (25) Mohamed Darwish Zahran (48).” Different encounters were mentioned in the case such as the possibility of premeditation, along with the death of Captain Bull, supported by any medical evidence available.\n“AS the crowd prevented the Major and his two comrades from getting into carriages, pulled them about and beat them, throwing bricks and dry mud at them…” I like this statement from the Egyptian Gazette, as I think of it as a simile to the present-day life of a student in some ways. As a student myself, being overwhelmed with homework, exams, quizzes can really seem as if I was getting metaphorically beaten, having bricks and dry mud thrown at you. Of course, nobody should have to know the brutal beatings that Captain Bull, Lieutenant Smithwick, and Major Pine-Coffin, along with other innocent people had faced in this attack. All in all, this has been the most enjoyable part of the story of the attack at Denshiwai, as it used some very descriptive language, making it as easy as possible to see the brutal beatings that occurred on that day in 1906.\n","date":1489622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489622400,"objectID":"e785edd6c108455b5945368ff95d076a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-16-pearce-blog/","publishdate":"2017-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-16-pearce-blog/","section":"post","summary":"In this portion of this Thursday issue of the Egyptian Gazette,","tags":["Denshiwai"],"title":"Reading of Sentence","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alexia Horton"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"For this class, I have been assigned the week of February 19, 1906. All in all, I have to say this has been one of absolute favorite classes. Not only have I learned to code and become what I like to call “tech savvy” but I am learning the everyday lives of individuals from not only the United Kingdom but from pretty much anywhere they associate with. When you think about it we are given Monday through Saturday editions of the newspaper to complete; that is a ton of work!\nIn every day’s edition, the page six usually consists of financial tables. This is by far the worse part of the “coding” aspect of the class. I mean, the class itself is very time consuming and tedious but using OCR really does help to speed the process up, but of course you cannot run financial tables through OCR. Not once, have I had an easy time just knocking out the page sixes. You might be thinking right now “I wonder what is so bad about the financial tables? You’re given the template, therefore all you need to do is change the actual information within it.” Well, you have successfully answered the question; building the template is the easy part, actually filling in the tables are the difficult part. Actually sitting down and attempting to read what the newspaper actually says the problematic part. Either the letters or numbers are so small that you cannot read it or (in most cases) the scans are extremely blurry in parts of the page. Majority of the time, even if I take smaller section scans of each page to get a clearer reading, it is still does not help. What I read as a three are sometimes an eight, or the “E” is actually a “D” or “B”. The comparison happen for almost every letter and number, it is just really hard to decipher. Although, I have to say, as frustrating as the page sixes are… typing the last text for that page, sitting back and say “ah yes! Finally I finished!” It’s an extremely rewarding feeling and then I can actually look at the information I wrote down and compare it to other issues and today’s information such as the stocks and shares portion.\nI find it quite interesting that when reading reviews of the Cisdem OCR system, on the following websites listed below, everyone seems to praise the system. I mean the system is indeed great, but I come across a lot of errors that still need to be fixed after running it through the OCR.

For the majority of this week, though, the section featured a regatta hosted by the Khedival Yacht Club. Unlike cricket, a regatta is a series of boat races, so I initially found its placement in the newspaper odd, until reading this sub article:\nYachting has apparently found an audience in Alexandria’s sporting community, so much so that private owners with large money influences have begun to participate in races.

The story pertains to a young fellow who always noticed an elderly prophet that always carries a hefty wheelbarrow. I was very amused to this piece because I notice many similarities between the prophet and your average college student. For instance, when the narrator mentions, “His skin, burnt almost black with sun and wind, his shaggy eyebrows and long white beard, suggest the prophets of ancient days”, reminded me of a college senior. As the prophet appears worn down from his exposure to the sun, one may compare that to how a senior appears exhausted, after years of sleep deprivation due to a tedious work load. Ironically, the narrator gave me the impression that he is a college freshman, because he is young and does not have the same years of experiences as the prophet. Many college freshman will not understand a college seniors’ desire to undertake a tedious task due to the lack of experience. However, as the years pass by, college freshmen will fulfill the seniors shoes, as the narrator will fill the prophet’s shoes. I believe this passage is very significant since it is still relevant after being composed 115 years ago.\n","date":1488931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488931200,"objectID":"bea9948776b82bc5252ce065f1cb1a62","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-08-fajardo-blog/","publishdate":"2017-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-08-fajardo-blog/","section":"post","summary":"One liner","tags":["college","stories"],"title":"Analysis of The Road Man","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jaime Sepulveda"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"I have never watched a game of cricket in my life, but I had always assumed it was somewhat similar to baseball.

Just from reading one week of issues of the Egyptian Gazette, I could tell that cigarettes were a major part of an Egyptian’s life. There was at least one advertisement for cigarettes on each page of the newspaper, but one specific advertisement in particular stood out to me the most: “H. \u0026amp; C. Flick, Cigar Importers.” Now this specific ad might not sound important to anyone else, but to me it was very interesting and got me thinking about my ancestry. I am 99.9% sure that I am not related to these Flick’s, but I wonder what it would be like to be a Flick in Egypt in 1906.\nIn 1905, Egypt imported a total of 8,078 tonnes of tobacco and a total of 8,377 tonnes in 1906 (Relli Shechter, Smoking, Culture and Economy in the Middle East: The Egyptian Tobacco Market 1850-2000, p. 59 ). The advertisement states that H. \u0026amp; C. Flick was the largest depot of cigars in Egypt, so I can imagine that Flick’s were a very successful in 1906 due to the increase in cigar imports from 1905 to 1906. Egyptian tobacco was usually very poorly made and didn’t taste very well, so most of the cigarettes in Egypt were not made from Egyptian tobacco (EGYPTIAN CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO, Journal of the Royal Society of Arts Vol. 59, No. 3034 (JANUARY 13, 1911), pp. 201-203). Due to Egyptian tobacco not being up to par with what most tourists and immigrants are used to, being a cigarette importer was probably a very good business.\nEven though I might not actually be related to H. \u0026amp; C. Flick, I now know that it would probably be a good family business in Egypt in 1906, but it might be harder to be a cigar importer in the United States in 2017 due to all the information about how terrible cigarettes are for our health.\nRelated Blog Post by ALEX CALIENDO: The Evolution of Cigarette Advertising.\n","date":1488758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488758400,"objectID":"c7c09f5d88e193d437b5e7968b7972e5","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-06-flick-h-c-flick-cigar-importers/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-06-flick-h-c-flick-cigar-importers/","section":"post","summary":"Am I related?","tags":["advertisements","cigar"],"title":"H \u0026 C Flick, Cigar Importers","type":"post"},{"authors":["RosalynBaxter"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"Mrs. Ida Caldwell, a seemingly sweet old lady, has been suffering with “catarrh of the respiratory organs on and off for the last three years”.

At a quick glance of the page, it immediately caught my attention. Yes, the big letters aided in that, but what was in the title is what really got me puzzled. “Ice Making Plants”? I thought, there’s no way they found plants that make ice. Upon continuing to read I saw it said “Power Driven Machines to produce 1 cwt. Per 24 hours” (or about 1lb ≈ every 15 mins). So now I drew another conclusion – they’ve made robotic plants that make ice instead of oxygen.\nObviously, this couldn’t be correct so I took it upon myself to call the number on the ad and ask – but of course I got a “Your call could not be completed as dialed” (must have been a typo). Unfortunately, they didn’t put an email I could contact so I went to my backup-backup plan and scoured the web. After adequate research, I came to my last conclusion: This misleading ad sold ice machines crankable by hand that could be used in factory plants to produce a lot of ice. I also concluded that the “Egyptian Engineering Co., LTD.” didn’t come up with the product, it just resold it as a white label.

I never considered the history of gum, but when I saw the article about the gum trade on Wednesday July 11th 1906 it made me think about how long people have been chewing gum. It’s quite interesting to think about. I am an avid gum chewer, so to think about the people that have been in my position a hundred years ago makes me feel quite small in the grand scheme of things.\nGum Trading? Apparently Egypt in 1906 was a major distributor of gum. They exported thousands of cantars of gum, for a decent profit, considering they apparently are a major distributor of the product. However, up to the end of June 1906, their crop yield was only half of what it was around that time the year before. This probably ended up being a severe loss in profit, but Egypt had plenty of money from other exports.\nWhat was gum actually used for? I also began to wonder if gum was actually used for chewing. Could it have been used for other purposes like so many things that existed hundreds of years ago. Was it used to hold something together? Was it used to stop leakages? Maybe it is used just as it is today, just as a way to keep your breath smelling fresh all day, no matter what.\nThe Answer… Upon further inspection the use of gum was not at all what it is used for today. I found out that “Arabic Gum” was used primarily as a food stabilizer. However, it was also used in traditional lithography, it was used in printing, paint production, glue and even cosmetics. Obviously this means that Gum in the Egyptian Gazette is not the same as the gum sitting in my pocket in 2017. I discovered that substitutes for chewing gum had been invented since the Ancient Greeks, however that was just tree bark. So, overall, gum as referred to in the Egyptian Gazette is quite different from the gum of today.\n","date":1488585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488585600,"objectID":"20d60b4bf607818797a0a7b9a4147e3b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-04-petersen-gum-blog/","publishdate":"2017-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-04-petersen-gum-blog/","section":"post","summary":"Yesterday gums up today","tags":["gum"],"title":"The Gum Trade","type":"post"},{"authors":["Katherine Ferguson"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"Typhoid fever ravaged many armies, including the Egyptian. Therefore, extensive research was conducted in order to identify the source of infection and how to prevent it. Dr. Leigh Canney was on the forefront of this field in Egypt during the 19th century. “Dr. Leigh Canney was able to produce evidence from the reports of the Army Medical Department to show that the Army was ‘sanitarily untrained and unprotected’”. Furthermore, he recognized that enteric disease came from unsanitary water. However, the Army Medical Department did not want to hear it; this was not the answer they were looking for. Sir T. Gallaway argued against boiling water before drinking stating that, “all our schemes for sterilization of water by boiling or otherwise have had no effect.” Dr. Leigh Canney persisted on not only the sterilization, but also the preservation of clean water. He urged the Army to keep clean water in enclosed clean bottles to prevent contact with flies and dust which could cause recontamination.\nTwo days after this article was posted, on December 6, 1905, a letter to the editor was published regarding the issues faced when implementing the rules on sanitary water. The author states that boiling water and allowing it to cool after a hard days work in the desert is simply impossible, and “the system is not sufficiently practical to hold water”.\nWhile both sides of the argument have made valid points, we now know that sanitizing drinking water is essential. Contaminated water houses pathogens such as Typhoid, Cholera, and a plethora of others. Although Typhoid had been identified in 1880, a vaccine was not developed and distributed until 1896. The chlorination of water during the 20th century also reduced Typhoid prevalence. Currently, India, Pakistan and Egypt are “known as high risk areas for developing this disease.” 21 million people are infected annually worldwide, with over 200,000 deaths.\n","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"801bbd9dcb8f98b3e57bc8a28c884e61","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-01-ferguson.katherine/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-03-01-ferguson.katherine/","section":"post","summary":"Why did Typhoid Fever last so long when Dr. Leigh Canney had given the army lectures and research  on the importance of boiling water before drinking it?

The Nile River is known for its length as the longest river in the world. The Nile River passes through eleven countries, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt (Pedersen). The Nile River supplies these countries with water and fertile soil. The Nile River floods during season and helps out with the harvesting of the crops that are grown beside it, too much flooding though, can cause serious damage to the crops. In order to know when the Nile River would flood the Ancient Egyptians measured the depth systematically. In a land with so little rainfall, this flooding was essential for the well-being of the crops.\nOne of the first forms of measurement of Nile River depth was the nilometer, this was very similar to sticking a ruler inside a glass of water and measuring. They had “…a vertical column submerged in the waters of the river, with marked intervals indicating depth of the water.” (Kaushik). This was a very simple but rather effective technique for measuring the depth of the river. Later on they got a little more complex and began building “…a flight of stairs leading down into the water, with depth markings along the walls” (Kaushik). The communities that lived by the Nile River suffered for some time when the river would not flood because of the lack of rainfall in Africa.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Egyptians decided to start building what was known as the Old Aswan Dam or the Aswan Low Dam. This dam was completely built by 1902, but had to be raised twice before they decided to build the Aswan High Dam. These dams were built with the idea of being able to control the river floods and generating hydroelectricity. The construction of these dams developed a whole new aspect to irrigation. Before the construction of the dams the yearly floods were sort of unpredictable, some years it would be just the perfect amount to make great fertile soil, but sometimes it was too much and would wipe out the whole field. Sometimes it did not flood and therefore still ruined the crops by draught. The dams primary purpose was to help regulate the floods (egitalloyd.com). The Old dam was the first attempt at something so great in the whole world, it had it mistakes and was later on of no use, only used to control tailwater for the High Dam. The High Dam provided many benefits for the community. It efficiently controlled the dangerous floods and the droughts. The High Dam also provided a significant increase in farmland. The High Dam also provided great hydroelectricity, “When the dam first reached peak output it produced around half of Egypt’s entire electricity production and allowed most Egyptian villages to use electricity for the first time” (egitalloyd.com). The Aswan High Dam became a large part of the Egyptian population and is till today very important.\nRecently the Nile River suffered a catastrophic event. Due to high amounts of heavy rain, this eminent water supply has turned brown due to all the soil that has been swept into the waterway. This massive flood has called to action of filtering the water for almost all of Egypt. Not only did it ruin the Nile but “…the floods caused power outages, displaced hundreds of people, and swept away dozens of cars…” (Associated Press). This is a great disaster because the government is not doing much about it, and many people are dependent on the river’s water and hydroelectricity.\nThe Nile River is very popular and most people know about it. When I encountered the Nile Gauge Readings chart in the Egyptian Gazette I was intrigued. The chart is big and catches everyone’s attention, therefore it caught mine. The chart does not explain what form of measurement they use to calculate the numbers provided, it just states the different places where they measure from. It totals up to eleven different measurements. Some of the measurements vary greatly from the others, which is crazy to me. This chart is meant to provide all the measurements for the whole month in the last issue of the month, but every week posts the readings for that particular week. The Nile Gauge Readings chart seems to be a complicated and therefore it was very hard to research much on it. In order to find typed information on other weeks I decided to go through the already completed weeks listed on the github website, when I looked through these markdown text and looked for “Nile Gauge Readings” many of these weeks did not have a chart at all. I understand filling out this chart is definitely a pain because of the many numbers associated so I decided to look for at least one that was complete. I found a complete chart on the 23rd of September in page 5. This chart because it was later in the month it had much more data than mine. This chart also had a different structure, it actually had comparison right next to each other of the levels of the water …","date":1486598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486598400,"objectID":"d200dce66501064c5fecc0003fa802e4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-crespo/","publishdate":"2017-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-crespo/","section":"post","summary":"The Nile River is a river that flows in Northeastern Africa.

The culture I am referring to is the African Pygmies and the goal of this paper is to learn more about them and their treatment in Cairo. I became interested in this topic when I read an article in my section of the paper entitled “Pigmies in Cairo.” The title struck me as interesting and caught my attention as I was spending hours on OCR correction. I read the article and quickly discovered that this was a topic that was very interesting to me and would, hopefully, make a good serial question for my individual project.\nOne problem that I have encountered in my research for this analysis is that the querying process refused to work on my computer. I followed the procedure found in the tutorials on the course website word for word but it refused to work for me. I then began an arduous process of looking through multiple page images in order to find an article about the Pygmies in someone else’s issue. The articles that I have found were very similar to the ones in my paper with very few differences mostly relating to where the pygmies would go next and any troubles in the process of getting there. One such problem was gaining permission to travel to London, England. This was largely the subject of the first article about the pygmies in my issue.\nBecause of the similarity in these articles, I had some difficulty in finding out who the pygmies were as a people. I decided to do a bit of research into the people to get a general idea of the culture discussed in the articles. What I found is that the pygmies are largely similar to any other indigenous African people with their own language, dances, village life and customs. The large difference between this culture and others is their height. These people are much smaller than the people of other cultures with the height of the average full grown man being 4’11”. This fact made the pygmies very interesting to the Europeans and those trying to make a buck off of their interest.\nThis is where Colonel James Harrison of Yorkshire comes in. He came across the indigenous pygmy people in the Ituri Forest during his travels and brought some of the pygmies back to Cairo. This was only a waypoint as he eventually paraded them all around London so that people could see the short people from Africa. In this sense, they were seen almost as circus freaks as many people in England had never seen a fully-grown adult that was as short as the Pygmies. Colonel Harrison promised to return these people to their homes when the tour was done and whether or not that promise was kept is not known to me as it was not discussed in the articles that I found.\n","date":1482192000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482192000,"objectID":"934bfe26ac251e04b2d7ef1a8046d17b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-frederick/","publishdate":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-frederick/","section":"post","summary":"The point of my serial topic is to learn more about a culture, that until recently I had never heard of, and how that culture is treated and viewed by different peoples.","tags":null,"title":"The African Pygmies","type":"post"},{"authors":["Anet Crespo"],"categories":["curiosity"],"content":"This advertisement is found on several issues of the week of May 22nd, 1905.

Hashish is an extracted concentrate from the marijuana plant leaves, that is much more potent and has been used for thousands of years, but popularity has risen in the past 500 years. Egyptians were the first to really use this drug and its importation and exportation has stemmed from the African continent for most of its history. Hashish shares a commonality with its parent, marijuana, in that the smuggling of it into countries where it is illegal will prove to be a very highly profitable business if you choose to take the serious risks that are involved. In my assigned the issues of June 26-July 1, I had 2 occurrences of hashish being found trying to be smuggled around Egypt, on boats and camels. When I saw the happening of this I realized a serial question could be posed from that, so I am going to see how many hashish seizures there were in the year 1905 by doing a serial analysis of the data that we have been provided by ourselves and classmates.\nThere are many occurrences of hashish popping up in 1905 in the Egyptian Gazette. Approximately 25 times in the year in some way hashish has been mentioned, whether in a medical way, or in a post about police seizing it and arresting others. Mostly it has been that hashish has been found or uncovered in a smuggling operation that has gone wrong. There is no shortage of ingenuity when it comes to smugglers, though for they have come up with many interesting ways of concealing the contraband from the authorities, and just like today, they will stop at nothing to make money and get their product to the foreign and very profitable countries that lie outside of their borders. Smuggling of marijuana related products is a serious offense, especially back in 1905, it was not taken lightly and smugglers were punished harshly by the authorities for the serious infringement on law they had committed. Hashish is very possibly the most documented smuggled item in the year; it would not be surprising to learn that it was the most widely smuggled item overall of the year, as Egypt is a large hashish producing and using country.\nThe first documented seizure is reported in the February 1st edition on page 3 saying there had been a hashish seizure by the Egyptian Coast Guard, in the desert. This was an interesting seizure and report for a few reasons, starting with the Coast Guard in the desert. The Coast Guard in the desert is weird but in Egypt much of the land was actually patrolled by their coast guard, this being their equivalent to the police these days. These men were said to be riding camels and had it hidden in the lining of their saddles completely undetectable to the untrained eye, but for the coast guard they know where to look and how to interrogate. How wild would it be to smuggle thing via camel back, and to have to come up with elaborate schemes to carry hidden Hashish past authorities, these guys were good.\nI noticed a really cool mention of Hashish came up on April 28th 1905 that was a fight about a previous edition’s column on Hashish being taken out of the market, and being condemned illegal. Someone says it is a large contradiction to say that it is off the market since they know sure and well it has never been so easily obtained and never been as cheap as it was at that time. They go on further to say that the coast guard will not impose as much as they would on it, as a lot of them were being paid “prize” money to turn a blind eye or they take it and sell it. It says that unless a large penalty is posted on Hashish it will remain a movable commodity, that switches hands between those who seize it and those who smuggle it. Something I have also never seen is marijuana referred to as a “noxious herb” and I thought that was hilarious. It is interesting to read this fight against a column because it is going directly against what the government claims and is truly being a sort of a whistle blower to the whole operation of hashish smuggling and the cooperation of authorities in helping them or helping themselves.\nThe next mention of Hashish comes on May 24th 1905 when there comes a column on a convention between Egypt and Greece discussing hashish cultivation. The column states that Egypt has given Greece a stern order to completely prohibit the cultivation of hashish. Greece though cannot complete the requests because it simply is not right or possible. It is not right because it is a chief resource to the people that live on the central plateau near Peloponnesus, so if they were to ban the cultivation of this cash crop, it would effectively take the poor farmers and going to send them into a deeper poverty and take away money from the Greek government. The Egyptians end the first convention with a null and void and nothing really happens but the proposition for a second has been announced.

At first it was a total chore, slowly trouble shooting every single issue that I had with the multiple programs I had no familiarity with (Oxygen, ABBYY Finereader, and Github), wishing that my advisor would’ve warned better beforehand of such things and hoping that I would have a free weekend again.\nBut after about 3 solid weeks of working, something clicked. I started enjoying this previously arduous work. The trouble-shooting became enjoyable, as every issue came to me as an interesting puzzle rather than a pace-breaking wall. Also, the whole philosophy behind this encoding became much clearer to me, and in a way, inspired me to take special care when it came to encoding.\nSome things on the tech side that I believe led me to enjoying this process more were:\nHaving a larger monitor to work on: I like having all the information I need to encode in view all at once, it helps me keep things in order and it just keeps things more accurate. Having a monitor that is larger than a standard 13-15-17 in laptop screen really helped me. I was able to pull up boilerplates, have oxygen open, and have a reference scanned image open all in sizes that I could view easily. This expedited the process greatly\nUsing a mouse: After trying to encode and OCR on my Surface and comparing it to my work on my desktop, I noticed a night and day difference in quality of pages and general frustration. The mouse allows you to have more exact control of your cursor and gives a less clunky access to your keyboard whilst moving your cursor between multiple points quickly.\n…and some other technical mishaps/advice\nMake sure you take the highest quality scans of your microfilm as possible: Because I was foolish and decided to separate my scanning sessions into different days, I ended up getting two different qualities of scans. This made OCR’ing extremely frustrating as it made some pages correctable in about 20 minutes and other pages taking over an hour and a half. In short, SCAN HIGHEST DPI POSSIBLE AND MAKE SURE THE SCANNER GLASS DOES NOT HAVE EXCESSIVE SMUDGING.\nAlways press Ctrl+S or “Save” after every page you finish in your issues: It’s been about 3 times that I’ve been so caught up in encoding that I forget to save for a few pages. Inevitably my computer updates or Oxygen crashes, and all that work is lost, leading to one too many instances of my palm colliding with my forehead.\nThe TEI webpage should be considered the holy text of this class.

Seeing education opportunities from the early 1900s is fascinating to me as it is during the century that public education became a cornerstone in developed nations.\nFirst are the Berlitz Schools of Languages, typically found under the “Cheap Pre-paid advertisement” column on Page 5’s. It sounded familiar to me, and after doing a brief amount of searching, this is a education company/institution that has persisted since 1878 all the way until to the present day, hailing from the state of Rhode Island. In 1905 however, students in Egypt would only be able to attend the locations present in Alexandria and Cairo, unlike now, as the Berlitz Corporation offers full courses online.\nThe next advert regarding education that intrigued me was the “English School, Nicosia” advertisement. Offering a range of subjects, from Turkish to Mathematics, this school seemed a little more similar to institutions of the modern day. Also, this school seemed to have a sessions of Cricket and Football to be played with the instructors, which struck me as something related to more modern school systems. After a small amount of searching, it appears that this school persisted to the modern day just as the Berlitz program did. Besides being one of the more notable institutions of higher learning in the Middle East, it is also an modern example of social change. For over two decades following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Turkish students were not admitted into the school, becoming a predominantly Greek Cypriot institution. However in 2003, the English School opened it’s admission to Turkish Cypriots and it’s general admission numbers have only grown exponentially since then.\nEven though during this time secondary education wasn’t seen as something that the whole of society deserved, it is still worth looking into these smaller institutions because it gives people a clearer understanding of how a system of education grows as more people become involved in it, and the social changes that occur through a better educated populace.\n","date":1481414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481414400,"objectID":"91ebbad3589f1eda9a9f9ce6ff8cf1f7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-12-11-curiosity_berlitz_nicosia/","publishdate":"2016-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-12-11-curiosity_berlitz_nicosia/","section":"post","summary":"Would you apply to a Secondary Institution because of an advertisement in the newspaper?","tags":["Education","Berlitz","Language","1900s"],"title":"Higher Learning through the Newspaper","type":"post"},{"authors":["Valerie Curcio"],"categories":["technical"],"content":"I’ve encountered many problems during the course of this class.

On one end of the spectrum, you had instances of local community reports about robberies, and local sporting events. At a wider view, the newspaper contained articles about the Egyptian economy, and world-wide events. While this is a great characteristic of generally any newspaper, for the purpose of the final project, the over abundance of diverse information made the process of choosing a serial question to research moderately difficult.\nBefore I decided on a definite serial question, I figured it would be worthwhile to familiarize myself with the process of querying. I wanted to ensure that when it came time to conduct research for my analysis, I would be able to search through the XML contents efficiently, and productively. In the process, I hoped to come up with a serial question. While the Xpath feature in Oxygen seemed complicated and somewhat foreign at first, I quickly came to one realization: the simpler the better. I started off with a basic query, //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;]. This allowed me to see all of the item divisions within each XML file, and from there I figured I could analyze the information within. However, I soon came to realize that more often than not, one item div contained multiple paragraphs of varying information, and I knew if I wanted to research more efficiently, I would need to find a more defined and targeted search query.\nFrom there, I employed the //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;\u0026#39;)] query. I started inputting random, but logically acquired words to search for within each div. At this point, I pondered the interesting nature of researching how Egypt and the United States of America interacted in 1905. I used //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;United States\u0026#39;)]to find all of the instances where “United States” was used in each item division. Although this query did return a significantly manageable amount of results, after brief analysis, I concluded that each result was typically completely unrelated to the last result. The most recurring instance of “United States” was within the mention of transportation boats traveling between Egypt and the U.S., but I could not envision completing a complete serial analysis about just that.\nAfter hours of trial and error through the process of querying The Egyptian Gazette, I began to feel that all of the results I derived from querying were either far too vast, or far too limited to conduct valid analysis. However, it was at this time that I reflected on prior research that I conducted in this course. I wrote my first blog post on a cigarette advertisement, and I remember feeling very curious about how different cigarette culture must have been back in 1905. So, naturally, I came up with what I thought was an intriguing serial question. What was smoking culture like in 1905 Alexandria?\nForemost, I queried the contents of The Egyptian Gazette with //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;cigarette\u0026#39;)]. This allowed me to view each instance where the word cigarette was used, and in what context. The results that followed suit were varied and of significant interest. Initially, I speculated that the mention of “cigarette” would come mainly within cigarette company advertisements throughout the Gazette. After looking at the results of my query, I came to the conclusion that there were numerous direct advertisements for various cigarette companies, however just because a cigarette company was mentioned does not mean that they were directly casting an advertisement. By this, I mean that many instances of cigarette company mentions were just reviews on the direction and standing of specific companies. Lots of economics talk came into play here.\nAt this point in my research I decided to start counting how many times the mention of “cigarette” and smoking-related terms showed up throughout 1905 in The Egyptian Gazette. This stemmed from the thought that numerical analysis of smoke-related term occurrence would prove to show insight into the popularity of cigarettes, and the culture revolving around cigarettes in Alexandria. In essence, I came to the hypothesis that the mentions of smoking-related terms within The Gazette would positively correlate with the popularity and acceptance of cigarettes within society during the time period this newspaper was written. Below is a graph depicting the amount of times three specific smoking-related terms were used throughout the entirety of The Gazette in 1905. Despite my initial thoughts, the words queried did not appear as many times as I assumed they would throughout the newspaper. Despite this, I still imagined that there was a prevalent culture revolved around smoking in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 1900’s.\nFrom here, I decided to begin to narrow in on my research and start analyzing more specific aspects.

The goal of asking this question was ultimately to reveal similarities and differences between three major cities at the time of the paper and through the unique lens of the Egyptian Gazette. In addition, shedding light on events going on at the time was also a primary goal of the project. The cities I chose to analyze were St. Petersburg, Russia; London, England; and Paris, France.\nIn order to obtain results for these cities, I used the XPath command //dateline[contains(., ‘London’)]. The word “London” was replaced with “St. Petersburg” and “Paris” in order to conduct the respective searches necessary for each city. After compiling a list of each of the instances these three cities were mentioned in a dateline, I culled through the results by reading and categorizing each news blurb. The categories I used for the three cities were Russian unrest, finance and business, military, religion, politics and policies, prominent people, entertainment and leisure, events, and medical. After tallying up the number of results for each city and category, I compiled the data into three pie charts- one for each city. A pie chart for a particular city allowed me to see the most commonly discussed events in the Egyptian Gazette for each place in question. Placing these pie charts side-by-side, however, allowed me to compare the most commonly discussed events amongst the three cities and analyze why the results are the way they are for the year 1905. I also drew ties to the real-world events that caused the reporting to contain the content it did.\nFirst off, it is worth noting that there is a certain degree of bias present in the news reporting, as the Egyptian Gazette relied mainly on two wire services. Because the paper was published primarily for wealthy English-speaking businessmen, the news blurbs might contain different content than if the Gazette was published for a lower-class section of the population. The news reported also may not accurately reflect the views of certain segments of the population. In addition, time delays and reporting errors could account for additional bias.\nWhile St. Petersburg is no longer the capital of Russia, in 1905 it was the imperial capital of the country. London became the official capital of Great Britain in the early 1700s, while Paris became the official capital of France much earlier, estimated to be at the end of the twelfth century. As such, all three of the cities I analyzed were capitals of their respective countries and the news coming from each of the cities was meant to represent the states of the countries as a whole.\nSt Petersburg When looking at St. Petersburg pie chart, I made a number of observations. First of all, during 1905, there was a Russian Revolution. While not explicitly called that in the paper, and while the revolution continued to build up and culminate in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Egyptian Gazette frequently reported on Cossacks, strikes, unrest, military mutinies, and government disputes with the peasants. All of this civil unrest is reflected in the fact that 63% of news reports in the Egyptian Gazette were centered in some way around Russian unrest. This is the largest proportion of reporting on a single topic throughout all of the three cities I examined. No mention of leisure or prominent people, except in the context of the Russian Revolution, shows that the major concern at the time was the civil unrest and mutinies occurring throughout the country. Russians likely did not have the time to preoccupy themselves with leisurely activities, as they were more focused on putting food on the table and scraping by in a controlling society. They were also not concerned with trivial news regarding well-off members of society or royalty. Russian leaders were not coveted by the majority of the population as they were in other locations.\nLondon and Paris In London, for instance, 19% of news reporting was devoted to reports of prominent people. Most of these mentions were not to discuss policies or politics, as there was a separate category devoted to these mentions. For the most part, the prominent people category documented the movements of the royal family, along with their acquaintances and dinner arrangements for the night. Fascination with people of celebrity status indicates that London in 1905 was at a further stage of development than Russia, and also that London expressed a higher level of satisfaction with its government. 16% of London news coverage was also dedicated to mentions of entertainment and leisure. Because people in England were less occupied with concerns of poverty and rebellions, they had more time to …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"decedd256a04e21d4052a4c67aef2919","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-summa/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-summa/","section":"post","summary":"My serial question for this paper was: “What topics are discussed in the international section of the Egyptian Gazette and how do these topics differ based on location?” In order to query this question, I decided to examine the news reporting for three major cities detailed in the international news section of the Egyptian Gazette.","tags":null,"title":"A Serial Analysis of St. Petersburg, London, and Paris Through the Lens of the Egyptian Gazette","type":"post"},{"authors":["Olivia Evanoff"],"categories":null,"content":" table Alexandria Egypt in 1905 kept a record of the news they deemed to be important via their newspaper. The title of the newspaper is “The Egyptian Gazette”. The newspaper kept a general record of the lives of not only the common person, but also the royalty. The third page was usually the most informative because it described the lives of the people, their festivities, their losses, and their own writings. However, I have drawn my focus more to the first page. The cover of “The Egyptian Gazette” provides details that can push us to understand the way the Egyptians lived. The first page is full of advertisements by different companies. The very first things you see when you grab the newspaper are advertisements. The recurring advertisements are, generally speaking, deemed the most crucial or the most well targeted ads. In comparison to modern times, that is what culturally seems to make the most sense. This newspaper was distributed to millions of people all over the city. So my question and intrigue is, why did these ads get put on the first page? Why did companies, assumedly, pay all of this extra money just to have their company advertised on the front page?\nThe reason I chose to study the advertisements is because the economy has a lot to do with the culture of a civilization. What people choose to buy and sell and the advertisements that are associated with it are a large portion of people’s lives. If a company is willing to spend crucial time, money, and resources to advertise their product or company, then people of that time ,generally, believe that it is quintessential to their lives. Another reason I chose to look into the published advertisements is because I am a business major. I like looking into the trends and fads of certain time periods. The comparison of how things were in 1905 and how they were important to society then, in comparison to the economic activities we partake in now, can be studied and examined to track cultural history. Looking through the advertisements we can see what people find to be desirable and the products society as a whole believes to be invaluable to their lives. The abundance of advertisements gives us ample amounts of material to examine the pieces of people lives and the way society valued specific companies. Each advertisements word choice and their designs were well thought out and planned. That gives us an additional perspective on the civilization. The way they advertise to people is specified and intentional. It is very interesting to me to see that some of the marketing tactics we utilize today were used over one hundred years ago. For these reasons I have chosen to analyze the different genres and the ways in which they are utilized in the society. I really feel that we can get more insight into the lives of people and the fads that were important to them if we look at their possible spending.\nComparing Ads In order to answer this question I had to first categorize or at least recognize the different categories of advertisements that were posted on the front page. The Eastern Telegraph advertisement is the very first one to be printed on the first pages. This advertisement falls under the category of communications. The prominency of the add and the fact that it is completely separated from the rest of the page of advertisements could possibly go to show that this was one of the more popular choices for sending information to other cities and countries. There are competing companies that were fighting for business as well. The Khedival Mail Line, Bibby Line Mail Steamers, and the Telephone Company of Egypt are all examples of competing firms. I have found that another major category of advertisements is travel and lodge. Each company is targeting a different group of people and travels to a different place. Some examples of these companies are Norddeutscher Lloyd, The Moss S.S company LLTD., Messageries Maritime, Hotel Brisco in Cairo, and Navigation Generale Ialienne are just a few of the most commonly appearing advertisements about travel and lodge. The excessive amounts of companies that offer travel opportunities can provide us with a wealth of information. It tells us that technological advances are allowing people to access the rest of the world without trouble. It might also tell us that 1905 Alexandria was a thriving time. If people were able to travel and pay the fees that go along with it, especially some of the more luxurious travel companies, then it had to have been a prosperous time. The mail line advertisements can tell us that information was reaching all ends of the world. People had the ability to send a note or a letter and receive one back in a relatively short period of time. This innovation and increase in technology fueled the economy and also allowed for access to pertinent information. This, culturally, goes to show that major advancements were being made to better people’s standard of living.

Alexandria was founded around a small Ancient Egyptian town c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great. From the late 18th century, the city profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, along with the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. As a result, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry in addition to one of the most important trading centers in the world. As great as this city sounds, many people will never realize the amount of crime that was committed throughout Alexandria’s history. By using instruments in my digital micro-history class, I have been able to reveal over a month’s worth of Alexandra’s newspaper, The Egyptian Gazette. This newspaper is filled with reports of anything from wars to sports, not to mention all of the crime.\nTurning this newspaper into an editable, digital form was no easy task. To begin, I had to scan a microfilm containing my week of the newspaper onto my computer. After this I began using an OCR software to convert the newspaper into documents that I could edit. I ran into my first issue when the OCR program poorly read the newspaper, forcing me to retype most of the articles. After finishing the OCR, I moved on to using an XML editor. This allowed me to organize my text into paragraphs, headings, or divisions in the paper. This was also a bit of a challenge for me because I didn’t understand the purpose of each tagging command. After a few attempts I learned to wrap any headers with a “head” tag, wrap any paragraphs with a “p” tag and finally enclose each division in the text with a “div” tag. Each student then uploaded their completed work onto Github allowing the teacher to form everyones’ work into one folder. Using Github was actually quite easy even though the website was completely foreign to me. We simply just had to upload our files and then use a pull request for our work to be submitted. As a result, Github gave me the option to access the newspaper in its final form and pose the serial question: Where and what type of crime occurred in Alexandria and other cities in the early 1900’s?\nSearching through each newspaper article day by day in search of various crime reports, would be extremely overwhelming. That is where, once again, the XML editor comes in handy. After downloading a folder with all of my classmate’s completed work and inserting it into Oxygen, the XML tool, I was ready to begin querying the digital version of The Egyptian Gazette. I had the ability to search through all of the content by typing in keywords that relate to crime such as arson, assault, robbery, and murder. After typing in a key word, a list of results appeared allowing me to view an article containing the word after clicking on it. This significantly helped me form my description and analysis on the crime in the 1900’s.\nA great deal of murder was repeatedly noted in the city of Cairo. In fact, many of these murders happened in a savagery manner. The first example is a cold-blooded murder outside of a church caused by someone firing a worker. While most killings were executed with a firearm, a revolver to be exact, there were still reports of stabbings. For example a man slew his victim with a knife before sunset, and after killing him, he cut his fingers and stabbed his dead body in nine different places. In addition, a few of the murderers were reported showing no remorse for their victims as they were “quoting verses and asking for a cigarette before mounting the ‘gallows.” An article in The Egyptian Gazette stated that executions were recently changed from occurring publicly to inside of a prison. The writer also shared his opinion, voicing that he felt public executions were more effective because the condemned person suffered more moral pain.\nAnother common form of crime found in the newspaper is theft. After reading through various articles it appeared that stealing is ubiquitous. Mapping all of the thefts would scatter throughout many Egyptian cities and even steamboats! Jewelry was the most reported stolen item, whether it was stolen straight from a store or from another person’s possession. An instance of pickpocketing occurred on a Steamer when M. Politi, a well-known resident, was caught in the crowd, emerging without his gold watch and chain with gold eagle attached, and a silver cigarette case. Although we usually associate thieves as low-life criminals or desperate, poverty-stricken individuals, it has been noted that even people with official positions still commit stealing crimes. A section in the Local and General portion of a newspaper reads, “Jewel Thief Captured- The Cairo police have succeeded in laying hands on the man who stole two brilliants valued at £250 from Carissian’s Jewelry establishment the other day. …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"f963ff54b77b94fde5358de23c3c9941","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-ouelette/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-ouelette/","section":"post","summary":"Alexandria is the second largest city and a major economic center in Egypt, extending about twenty miles along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis","type":"post"},{"authors":["David Gressgott"],"categories":null,"content":"My serial question for this course was centered on the waves of anti-Semitism that was beginning to emerge around the world. The majority of this hate, especially in 1905, was based in Russia. Possibly, were there any warning signs that could have hindered the Holocaust that resulted in later years? Throughout the course of this newspaper you can find bits and pieces of prejudice acts happening to Jews.\nThe Egyptian Gazette was one of the main newspapers that were in circulation during 1905. It was highly respected and sought out by a plethora of people during its time. Like most common newspapers it had current events along with local ordeals, economic information, and advertisements. At this exact point of history the biggest event going on at the time was the Russo-Jap war. Although Egypt wasn’t directly involved in the war you could get all the information you would ever want from this newspaper.\nThe beginning of this course required us to collect all the pages that we were assigned to. We had to use microfilm and take pictures and then convert the pictures over to text and finally xml format. At first the majority of my images were too blurry and would result in illiterate text. I had to go back and stitch together the images to make sure that the quality would suffice. After this was done I corrected all of them into text files and converted them over to xml. At this point I had to organize the text with headers, paragraphs, and divisions. This allowed my work to be easily read and interpreted. For me this part took me the longest. Having to manually enter each one of those coding messages. The most beneficial/intriguing part of this entire class is how we all contribute to the repository. I am able to view all of the information my classmates have produced and use that to analyze the entire newspaper. To me personally this is the best part of the class. I haven’t been a part of any sort of class like this and it’s new and fascinating. The querying part of this project made it easy to access all of the information I needed. For my question I queried different words like “Jewish”,”Jew”,”Russia”,”pogrom”. I was able to find different spots in the paper were these words were mentioned. The majority of these words were mentioned in news reports telling us about some sort of act of violence associated with the Jews. Often there was some sort of riot or protest that ended badly.\nA pogrom is an organized attack on an ethnic group of some sort. There are several of these that happen throughout the time frame we are studying. One event that happened in Odessa, which is a city in Ukraine. Caused a lot of havoc and uproar resulting in up to 2,500 Jews being killed. The authorities would usually accelerate these gatherings and begin the violence. There wasn’t any written violence like this occurring in Alexandria. For some reason almost every act of hate was centered in Russia and the countries neighboring it. This was very easy for me to figure out due to the fact that I could look up every single article that mentioned something that had to do with Jews. This advantage allowed me to narrow in on specific information throughout the newspaper.\nThis class had a plethora of fantastic tools that we learned how to master throughout this course. Some of them, proved to be difficult at first but with time were somewhat easy to figure out. To my personal liking this wasn’t one of my most favorable classes. There was a lot of busy tedious work involved. I like to learning and exploring and it’s hard to do that when you have to put countless hours into this project before you can start. Once I got through the majority of this process the class did have a lot of satisfying learning experiences. In the future I would suggest lessening the workload to allow the students to work with the overall information more, while focusing less on their individual project. I think this would benefit them and make them have a greater appreciation for the process of this class. I was able to come to the conclusion that a good majority of the articles that mentioned Jewish oppression could have been used as warning signs. Almost all of these entries described the secret police of the Russians causing harm to the their citizens. Anybody could have read these and started a movement to end to hatred. This in turn may have lead to other people realizing this is wrong and changing their viewpoints as well. Who knows if enough people began to think like that maybe future anti-Semitic acts wouldn’t have concurred.\n","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"d8c14e517ac2d6a661df8fba364b4373","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-gressgott/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-gressgott/","section":"post","summary":"My serial question for this course was centered on the waves of anti-Semitism that was beginning to emerge around the world.

Each student in the class was allocated a week to digitize the paper’s contents, so the the year’s contents could then be searched and analyzed by each member of the class for their individualized final projects. The results from the students’ collaborative efforts over time, and the large volume of data obtained from these searches refocused the shape that the final project would take. Instead of analyzing instances of ‘disease,’ a very broad spectrum, the focus then shifted to the analysis of a more narrow and repetitive disease called the ‘Bubonic Plague’, or the ‘Plague.’\nBefore analyzing the results of the search, some hurdles had to to be overcome. For instance, utilizing the editing platform oXygen and its search field xPath query was difficult at first. Certain formulas needed to be understood and then used which also required a consistency on those who contributed to the database. Fortunately, Dr. Will Hanley paved the way for those utilizing these search features by presenting the actual search feature formulas as well as explaining the use for each.\nSome results in the search did contain the word ‘plague,’ but sometimes the surrounding contents were not legible due to the issue with the OCR software. The OCR was used to transmit the .jpg content to a .text format, but in most instances this software did not work and required the user to type the information directly from the .jpg itself, in some instances, the misinterpreted OCR results were simply not corrected.\nThe most basic formula (shown above) was used in searching for instances of Bubonic Plague. This search function essentially searches for any term that was housed within a ‘div’ tag. There was some difficulty in using the most basic of search functions in that the search yielded some results that were not exactly relevant to the specific disease Bubonic Plague. Further, there were subtleties that were found (by accident) in the search function. For instance, a search of plague (lowercase) yielded 115 results and a search of the word Plague (uppercase) yielded 50 results. The uppercase version showed more concrete information on the actual disease and most of the results had the word plague mentioned multiple times. This also serves to show the power of the oXygen editing platform and the xPath query function.\nThe next issue was to determine how to analyze the results that were found within a year’s worth of information housed within the Egyptian Gazette newspaper (see pie-chart below). In addition to the contents of the Gazette, outside sources also guided the direction of this paper. One instance, as you will see below, is the time of year that the bubonic plague frequented certain areas of Egypt.\nFifteen percent of the word occurrences of ‘plague’ found within the Egyptian Gazette were of other meaning than the actual Bubonic Plague that affected humans and warrant at least some attention due to its involvement within the Gazette. Eleven percent of these word occurrences affected cattle and was thus termed: “Cattle Plague.” An article written by W. Littlewood, M.R.C.V.S., chief veterinary inspector Sanitary Department, aptly titled, ‘Cattle Plague in Egypt in 1903-0405,’ The Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics, 1/1/1905, Volume: 18, Page 312-321, indicated that the cattle plague made entry into Egypt as a result of trading with countries to the east and south: “\nThe first (cattle plague) invasion of Africa during the last twenty years was undoubtedly due to the introduction of cattle either from Arabia through Aden, or to shipments from Bombay to Massowah in the winter of 1887 and 1888, during the war between Italy and Abyssinia. From Massowah the disease rapidly spread over Italian territory, and thence to Abyssinia. We have no definite information as to whether the disease entered the now Anglo-Egyptian Soudan at the time, but if such was the case the losses must have been small, as there were large numbers of cattle in the Soudan when it was occupied by the Anglo-Egyptian Forces a few years later.\nTwo more items of discussion before getting into the bubonic plague. 1) Words unrelated to the disease, as an example, mention the “plague of social evils in Cairo;” hence, the use of this term is not relevant to the article, and 2) It is not entirely impossible, that with the lack of tools and modern information, that some diseases may have been categorized as the bubonic plague as opposed to the flu, though there is little evidence that has been shown that points to the contrary.\nSome information about the bubonic plague, also known as, the Black Death. As noted in a previous post, the bubonic plague was not confined to Medieval Europe (as many readers would suspect). In fact, the Bubonic plague has existed for thousands of years, the first known case being recorded in China dating …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"d92d8254eb93466612892326f3f2c934","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-cyr/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-cyr/","section":"post","summary":"The goal of this final project was to focus and analyze instances of ‘disease’ found within the pages of the Egyptian Gazette in the year 1905.

As the paper was primarily geared towards the international businessman, I suppose this comes as no surprise. It reminded me, however, of a banking crisis that occurred in Alexandria in 1907. At the local level, the blame is normally placed on excessive speculation in the real estate market, but the underlying causes are said to have emanated in global capital markets. Specifically, massive insurance payments made in San Francisco after the Great Fire dramatically increased the local money supply, spurring inflation and imbalances which were then transmitted into global financial markets. The implication of all this, however, is that by the turn of the century, global capital markets had integrated to a sufficient level to allow seemingly local shocks to have international ramifications. In other words, one may consider this from a perspective of globalization. Just how connected were the different financial markets in America, England and Egypt? To what extent did investors live in a “globalized” world, where international news was consumed to make business decisions at the local level? When what did was going on “over there” matter “over here”? I would like to ask my serial question then in a way which would return quantitative data on the responsiveness of the market in Alexandria to international factors. But what variables should I examine?\nThe first step is to consider the source in its original context. From an economic perspective, the paper would convey information from international markets to investors in Alexandria, which would then be processed and acted upon by the investor. A natural first question then, is to consider the scope of the “international” world in Alexandria in 1905. The process of globalization is often described as a reduction in the size of the world-not in a literal sense, but in the way that global flows of information have become instantaneous. The internet was obviously a few years off in 1905, but the world was revolutionized in much the same way by the development and growth of trans-oceanic telegraph lines. Gehan Rachty, writing of the history of telecommunications in Egypt, notes that telegraphic lines existed in Egypt as early as 1856. He traces the growing network’s development in tandem with increasing British involvement in Egypt, all part of “the British administration’s self-interested desire to link Egypt to the United Kingdom in the world.” The map below shows details of Eastern Telegraph lines in the Mediterranean in 1900. It is interesting to note that Alexandria appears to be a regional hub for telecommunications at the time.\nTo try and get an idea of the scope of the “international world” in 1905, I decided to start by examining how many unique places are mentioned in the Gazette. I utilized the following X-path query:\nQuery 1: //placeName\nAlthough simple, this query returned 6,802 place names. After removing the basic expressions and duplicates, I was left with 1,185 unique locations. I imported the date into Google Maps, and after correcting the obvious errors, I was left with the resulting map:\nThis diagram demonstrates that the Gazette delivered information from all over the globe, but the geographic distribution is far from random. To examine this geographic scope in terms of technological advancement, I overlaid a map of the Eastern Telegraph Company’s global telegraph lines on top of the mapped place names. The following was the result:\nFascinatingly, the geographic spread of place names mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette matches the distribution of existing telecommunications infrastructure. Even the data points that appear to be outliers fit with the distribution of cables. While globalization is usually used to describe planet-wide changes, the data in this map shows why this approach is misleading. Telegraphic lines appear to converge on centers of contemporary trade, and then radiate out into what would have been colonial holdings. Thus this world could be described as “globalized” and “interconnected,” but in reality it’s only the economically relevant places that are linked to this network, and the empty regions of this diagram show those areas not yet integrated. The question here, however, is economic in nature, and confined to the particular case of Egypt’s capital market integration. This diagram then seems to affirm a high level of integration of Egypt into global markets from the standpoint of availability of global information.\nWhile the trans-oceanic linkages bring images of global web connections to mind, the reality is that these information flows were not instantaneous, and the undersea cables were often damaged and unusable until they were repaired or replaced. Further, if the map of telegraphic lines is examined from the perspective …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"4a69ba9e61b1019f425b417659904756","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-crawford/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-crawford/","section":"post","summary":"In the process of digitally transcribing the Egyptian Gazette, I was struck by how much of the paper was devoted every day to financial tables, commodity price lists, and information on cargo shipping.","tags":null,"title":"Capital Market Integration","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kara Hofmeister"],"categories":null,"content":"While working on assignments for this class, I quickly realized that the formatting of my issue was very different from the rest. Many of my advertisements were different, the financial tables were all ordered in a weird way, and my Wednesday issue only contained six pages instead of eight. This caused many problems for me because I would have to make all of the tables myself, which was very time consuming and confusing because I had no idea how to do any of it. Particularly, the tables for Marche de Minet-el-Bassal were very different. The first change I encountered with this table was actually in my own week. I first saw the table on page two of my first day, January second, then noticed that on January third the table began appearing on page 4. After looking through images of the other issues, I noticed the table then remained on page four. I also quickly noticed that issues containing eight pages would display these data tables on page six, and many issues in December contained eight pages throughout the week, not just the usual Wednesday and Saturday issues. So, I am left curious as to why it was on page two of the first issue of the year. Maybe there was a mistake made or something of the sort but the reasoning is lost in history.\nFormat Changing The next thing I noticed was how the format of the table changed. I was super confused when I looked at how different my first Marche de Minet-el-Bassal was from the template posted. Mine was so much smaller and shorter than the template, I thought I was missing information and spent a good bit of time scanning the page for the rest of it. Thankfully, for me, this difference saved me time due to how much smaller it was. To gather data for this, I individually looked through each image file posted on the group github because I knew that not many people would have filled out the chart and wanted to try to get accurate data. While looking through the page images of the whole newspaper, I continued to notice small differences between the table in different issues. Most of the differences occurred between the sections titled “disponsible” and “section des graines et cereales.” One of my pages from January had a section called “coton” in between, an issue from April had one named “oignons,” while another issue from July had no extra section.\nTo gather data for this particular table, I searched through all of the uploaded files. I did this research between over the course of two days, November thirtieth and December first, so the data only includes pages uploaded between those days. I did a query of the title of the table, which yielded a total of one hundred and eighty one files. I found that there were a total of five different formats of the table. I then continued to count how many times each particular format was used. I tried to find a distinct trend as to when certain formats were used. The only thing that I did notice was that the bulk of Option A occurred towards the beginning of the year, and Option B was dispersed mostly in the spring/summer months, and Option C was mostly found starting in the end of summer throughout the winter. I am not sure why this would occur but it did. Options D and E were completely random and I was very confused as to why those formats were used. I thought maybe on those particular days there was no information or data to be recorded, but if that is the reason, why would they include the section at all? I thought this to be very weird.\nOption A Option B Option C Option D Option # To look further into this change, I ran a second search through the pages to look into the number of \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; tags under the title of “MARCHE DE MINET ET BASSAL.” From this, I took the data from the search to make a chart to compare the varying lengths of this table throughout the year. For the graph, I made the first group of data start from one instead of zero because while many people had the title of the chart in their xml, they had zero \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; tags because they did not fill out the chart and I did not want to include this in my final analysis. With this search, I was looking to find the average length of the chart, so the charts that were not completed did not contribute to my analysis. Out of the one hundred and sixty three results that came up from the search, only fifty two contained \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; tags. I was able to identify the average range of \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; tags for the Marche de Minet et Bassal table fell between twenty one and thirty. This could be due to the different formats I had already discovered throughout the newspaper. I would postulate that this variance could be due to how each student set up their own table in xml, however we were all provided with the same template so I do not think that hypothesis is a strong contender.

Britons and her subjects lived in places far apart and diverse, from England herself to, of course, Egypt. The Egyptian Gazette was the chief source of information for Britons living abroad in Alexandria and the other cities of Egypt, and, as one would expect, it had an international news section. An obvious question to ask here once you’ve learned of that fact is the following. What exactly were Anglo-Egyptian expatriates interested in, or at least, what did the Gazette think they were interested in? I decided to find out, cataloguing four months’ worth (May-August 1905) of the international news section on p. 3 of the daily newspaper, marking down each and every single mention of cities and countries within those barriers.\nCountries Map\nI generally started by viewing the XML files of the various documents, and double checking with the page images, to collect the cities/countries mentioned most often. I then consulted with individuals on a website called Quora to figure out the modern names of cities mentioned in the Gazette that no longer have those names, such as Kalismi or Kalisz and Dayet or Da Lat. Then I used a blank basemap of the year 1905 to map out the countries mentioned most often (Russia, Japan, France, and so on) before transferring to Google Spreadsheets and Google GeoCharts to map out the cities.\nStarting with the cities, the top three were London (142 mentions), St. Petersburg (109), and Paris (91). It’s obvious why London is at the top. It’s the capital of the British Empire, which, as we all know, mightiest civilization on human history, especially at the time. However, London’s role as capital as the British Empire wasn’t as much a reason for its large results as you might think, given that the country of Great Britain only received eighty-five mentions throughout those four months. No, it’s a variety of reasons that gave London its position at the top of the list. Each and every time cricket matches or horse racing came up, London was there. Every time there was a scuffle in Parliament, market news, or some politician needed to make a statement, London came up. Of course, whenever something came out that effected the Empire as a whole, London was involved.\nBut whereas London’s high score was due to their rule as a city with many connections, so to say, St. Petersburg and Paris most certainly saw their scores inflated by certain events. In the case of St. Petersburg, whenever news about the civil unrest, protests, riots, and uprisings in Russia came to be, news was relayed from the capital of the Russian Empire. Or on a similar note, there is also the Russo-Japanese War to consider. St. Petersburg has to respond to each sunken ship, each victory, and each defeat. Whenever there’s any sort of news on the Russian side of the equation, the Tsar’s office must make a comment. As for Paris, the First Moroccan Crisis that saw them in heated debate with Germany over the sovereignty of Morocco drastically inflated their score, as well as that of their mother country (123 mentions). More often than not, news about the Crisis would come right out of Paris. Then there were the seemingly unceasing news of such-and-such royal visiting such-and-such place, and it appeared as if they always visited or originated from the City of Lights.\nScores being inflated by certain events was by no means uncommon. Odessa (25) was the sight of a rather curious little affair, as it became the center of the story of mutineers taking over the Russian battleship Potemkin. Warsaw (23) saw dozens of riots during 1905, one of the precursor years of the Russian Revolution. Vladivostok (23) was crucial to the movement of Russian ships in the Russo-Japanese War. The Russian town currently known as Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (6) and the Japanese cities of Tsu-Shima (6) and Nagasaki (4) likely wouldn’t have even come up in the Gazette without the war. Tokio (69) certainly wouldn’t have been as high as it was. Heck, even Washington (41) wouldn’t be where it is were it not for being the initial site of peace negotiations between Russia and Japan, or an important relay for general war news.\nCountries saw similar levels of inflation. Russia was the highest, at two hundred and three mentions, almost certainly due to the war and unrest. Japan, the seeming victor throughout most of this period of the Russo-Japanese War, saw one hundred and forty-seven mentions, as well as several think pieces throughout the year regarding their future in geopolitical affairs. As previously mentioned, both France (123) and Germany (78) saw their values inflated by the First Moroccan Crisis, and of course, so did Morocco (35). Naturally Great Britain (85) saw a fair bit of mentions just by being the most powerful nation on Earth, while the United States (41) earned their spotlight by playing peacemaker with Russia and Japan. …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"3762f0a4206f680c1d194dc88987c922","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-white/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-white/","section":"post","summary":"It is an unquestionable fact that the British Empire was one of the mightiest and most widespread civilizations in human history.

In order to do so, I needed to find every list of events in the paper. In order to find these, I began with my own issues of the paper, knowing I had labeled everything of this sort with “scope=’calendar’” so all I had to do was use the regular search function and find all of these. Once I had done so, I took note of what each of these segments were called; it seemed there were only the “Calendar of Events,” “Coptic Calendar/Weekly Calendar,” and “Seasonal Fixtures.” Knowing that the Coptic calendar had nothing to do with the information I was looking for, I elected to ignore it in my search. Therefore, I began searching every issue for the term “calendar” and the string “seasonal fixtures.” I had to do so manually, flipping through every issue and using the less powerful search function, because my xpath is malfunctioning for some reason and won’t return any results, even when I search for strings that I know exist at least within my own issues of the paper. Also, there were too many flags on some issues to attempt to resolve them so I could get information from those issues of the paper via the xpath query. Regardless, I carried out my search and found the issues of the paper containing calendars and lists of events.\nHowever, there is almost no information regarding calendars until May in the paper, and some months (such as June) have very few entries that I could find. Thus, my knowledge of the most common events in Alexandria and/or Cairo in 1905 is hindered by that, and I can only draw conclusions based on the time frames I have information for. I cannot draw any conclusions or make assumptions about the beginning of the year, but my data is probably fairly sound from July through December despite the missing weeks not transcribed this semester. I decided not to consider events in January of 1906 as they don’t specifically pertain to my question. Another problem I ran into quite often was typos in the calendars, since it’s easy for the OCR to identify numbers incorrectly. The solution to this problem was very simple, actually: the calendars of 1905 and 2017 occur on the same days, so I could reference next year’s calendar for accuracy of the dates.\nOnce I had all of my information, I began to construct a master calendar, so I wouldn’t accidentally count the same event twice in my research. I also categorized the events instead of writing each individually and I categorized the times of events instead of writing every time down. The groups of events are: opera, concert, theatre (any production made by a theatre company which does not fit into the former two categories), variety entertainment (some events were labelled this, others were one-time events which fell into the category of entertainment such as a circus or a horse race), dances and balls, religious celebrations or secular celebrations (this category includes festivals and church services), sport events (I will discuss this category more in length later), meetings (I will also discuss this category more in length later), Ghizeh Boys’ Band (this event only occurs in the Cairo calendar, not in the Alexandria calendar), and the British Military Band (this event also only occurs in the Cairo calendar, not in the Alexandria calendar; beyond that, this is another account I shall discuss at greater length later).\nOne thing I noticed about the other calendar, the Coptic and Mahomedan Weekly Calendar, is that it only began to occur in the second half of the year. Prior to that, there was a weekly calendar, but never a Coptic Calendar. However, beginning in July, there was a Coptic Calendar published almost as often as the weekly calendar- 40 instances of the Coptic Calendar and 44 instances of the weekly calendar in the months of July through December. 16 of those Coptic Calendars occur in issues which have no weekly calendar and 20 weekly calendars occur in issues with no Coptic Calendars. Some issues will even end up containing two Coptic Calendars. I did not find any sort of pattern in the Coptic Calendars or even in the weekly calendars, but that may have something to do with the many missing and incomplete issues of the paper.\nMoving on to the results of the analysis of the Master Calendar, it appears that the most common event in Alexandria was meetings with 22% of the events I found. The majority of these meetings were for the Rifle Club and another notable group was the Yacht Club which met quite a few times. Just below that were sports (16%), concerts (15%), and dances/balls (13%). The most notable of the sports were the numerous football matches that occurred in the city, between various different groups- most often business groups. Of the concerts, I had to remove quite a few entries once I noticed a pattern, there were 3 different hotels doing daily concerts which means …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"394e690b471e9bb8bf9add42f6fed3b4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-lappin/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-lappin/","section":"post","summary":"I am researching the most common events publicly hosted in Alexandria, and possibly Cairo for comparison, and what this could possibly mean about the culture of the people.

By this, I mean that I was curious about individual lives and stories. The people mentioned in The Egyptian Gazette lived radically different lives than we do today, and I was curious about their experiences. The social workings of the society were particularly interesting to me. So, I began to think about the class structure and how this came through in the newspaper. One other interesting aspect of the paper to me was how little information was known sometimes. For example, in one issue a princess went missing, and that was the end of the story. They had one guess as to why she possibly might have left and nothing more. The idea of missing persons and how this problem was handled in Alexandria in 1905 was fascinating as well. So, I mashed the two thoughts together and decided to look at how this was related to class structure (how much was written about the missing person, what information was given). Unfortunately, this serial question fell through when I started to look through everyone else’s weeks. There was little to no information on my topic. The occurrences I had found in my week were evidently not a common element.\nThe fact that my serial question was not proving to be very fruitful was somewhat panic-inducing at first. However, there was no time to waste, so I began exploring The Egyptian Gazette for something that would strike up a new interest. I continued to keep a focus on individuals and their stories, but this time I also searched for recurring themes so I would not end up in a similar pickle as the one I found myself in before. That’s when it dawned on me…exploring! There were many mentions of expeditions and explorers throughout the newspaper. As I started to read through these accounts, I developed a new serial question. I would look at the individual journeys to discover the reasons for traveling, where they were travelling, and if the journey was successful based on their initial purpose. Once I had analyzed each expedition, I could map them out and come up with some conclusions about expeditions in the year 1905 that were somehow relevant to Alexandria, Egypt. I hoped that this would provide insight into common destinations as well as common curiosities, concerns, or problems that led to a need for such explorations. Also, what kind of people were going off on these expeditions? How much of a risk was such an endeavor for these explorers? How far would they typically go? What limitations were there? There was an endless supply of questions that could have been asked about these expeditions. By the end of my own exploration on this topic, I hoped to have a grasp on the who, what, where, and why for expeditions in the year of 1905.\nThe first (and fairly obvious) bit of information that I gathered was that Cairo and Khartoum were the most common start and end points for the expeditions. Another interesting element to this discovery was that only the private expeditions seemed to either start or end here. From the start, it was apparent that some expeditions were done through large corporations, such as Corporation of Western Egypt, or governmental necessity, such as the camel purchasing expedition that was scrutinized for its appearance as a pleasure trip. Others, such as those that either began or ended in Cairo or Khartoum, involved an explorer and possibly a group to accompany him (I say “him” because there were no female leaders for these expeditions). I decided to classify expeditions such as these as “private” and the others as “official” to distinguish between the two categories that I had noticed.\nIn total, I tracked five private investigations and two official expeditions. For three out of the five private expeditions, game hunting was the main purpose or was at least mentioned as a goal of the explorer. There did not seem to be a favorite hunting spot among these explorers. However, it is worth noting that Mr. D. P. McGillivray seemed to be the most successful with his hunt which took place in Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia). Count Teziersky’s hunting expedition in Mobarakeh appeared to be successful as well, despite his health challenges at the end. Interestingly, Mr. J. J. Harrison’s exploration was never mentioned in the newspaper again after the initial article stating where he was to go and why. He intended to secure an okapi in “the forest region” and end his expedition in Khartoum. Sadly, there was no further indication of whether he actually accomplished this or not. This is quite the opposite of how the Powell-Cotton expedition and McGivillivray expedition are documented throughout the newspaper. There were regular reports of these two expeditions, including reports on the health of the explorers. This leaves the J. J. Harrison expedition as somewhat of a mystery. It is difficult to say why The Egyptian Gazette would not …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"d32b2c407dd7113849dce699fcb2feb7","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-taylor/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-taylor/","section":"post","summary":"screenshot For an active version of the map use this link.\nWhen I first began looking through the newspaper I knew I was interested in the people.

We know the Japanese eventually won the war and we are aware of the major battles that occurred at sea. The information in the Egyptian Gazette can provide us with a wealth of ship names, smaller skirmishes, admirals and fleet movements that would otherwise go unmentioned in most historical collections. Querying the Digital Egyptian Gazette certainly produced an impressive micro-historical account of what happened on the seas.\nThe most difficult part of querying for this data was the large amount of inaccurate or conflicting information. With the recent advent of the wire system, naval news was rather hard to come by and often the wire reports would be delayed and coming from a variety of sources. Havas, Reuter and other correspondents would all have their available naval information published a day or two after the actual events transpired. I’d have to comb through these clumps of naval news, cross checking conflicting reports and back-tracking to figure out the date that events transpired as opposed to when they were reported. On several occasions, information from one day would be edited or overturned in a publication one to two days later.\nI searched the text for terms such as: “navy”, “Rodjestvensky”, “Togo”, “fleet” and “battle”. After searching with each key word, I search through the text XPath finds and collect each piece of naval information that relates to my question. I then transcribe the date, location and details of what occurred onto paper or a word document. Then, using Google Maps, I plot points at the various locations of naval action and tag them with a description of the available information. The points are numbered in order of date to provide logical progression of fleet movements.\nThe various points that I record are organized into three different layers on the map. The first layer is for illustrating the movements of the Russian fleet, which is colored blue. The second layer is for instances involving the Japanese fleet and those points are colored red. The third and final layer is colored purple and reserved for points of engagement between the Russians of the Japanese. The three layers can be added and removed as the viewer pleases, allowing for dense areas of the map to be cleaned up.\nAs the project came together I noticed that the Russians seem to have their fleet far much more spread out than the Japanese did, likely making their battle groups smaller and more susceptible to the larger collections of Japanese forces. The Russians appear to have had the majority of their fleet stationed in the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean. According to data not in the Digital Egyptian Gazette, the main fighting force of the Baltic Fleet led by Rodjestvensky sailed from the North Sea around Africa to Madagascar. After the devastating Russian defeat at Port Arthur, a smaller portion of the Baltic Fleet that had remained near the North Sea departed for the Mediterranean. From there, they moved to confront the Japanese threat by traveling East through the Suez Canal to Madagascar where they then met up with Rodjestvensky. Throughout the year, there were frequent reports of small groupings of Russian warships that were detached from main forces moving from harbor to harbor, searching for repairs, coal or mercenaries to join their cause. Essentially, it seems that the Russians were split into fragmented groups that coordinated poorly. Conversely the Japanese were already well established and concentrated in the far East and had most of their military vessels consistently in large battlegroups.\nNaturally, most of the action occurred near contested territory in China, Japan and the Eastern coast of Russia. Significant battles were fought in this region, such as the Russian defeat at Port Arthur and then again in the Korean Straits, an event which left Admiral Rodjestvensky devastated. This battle in the Korean Straits, also known as the Battle of Tsushima, resulted in the destruction or capture of the majority of the Russian navy. According to the Gazette, the Russians were taking the risky route through the straits with the hopes of reaching the port of Vladisvostok. They traveled at night to avoid detection but in compliance with the rules of war, the trailing Russian hospital ships left their lights on which alerted the Japanese to the Russian presence. It is not surprising that the Russians were defeated so horribly by the Japanese with twenty-two of their ships sunk or captured. The Japanese only lost three torpedo boats in that pivotal fight. That information tells us that not only were the Russian sailors inexperienced in defending and maneuvering their own ships but they were …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"f8c9dac662425a7b8ae1435b7e5fd2a8","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-stefonek/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-stefonek/","section":"post","summary":"figure Please click here to access my full data visualization.\nMy serial question is, “Where were the Russian and Japanese fleets during the year of 1905?” I am asking this question because the Russo-Japanese war occurred during this time and the two military powers engaged in quite a bit of naval combat.","tags":null,"title":"Fleet Tracking","type":"post"},{"authors":["Dante Grieco"],"categories":null,"content":"For millennia, cotton has been cultivated extensively in Egypt along the banks of the Nile Valley.\nMy serial question involves looking at a snapshot in the historical trends of the cotton trade in colonial Egypt. During Egypt’s years under British colonial rule, cotton became an incredibly significant and profitable cash crop. Following the decline in American cotton production because of the American Civil War, England turned to Egyptian cotton as a source of profitable trade within its empire. To gain a sense how the cotton trade behaved during this period, my analysis uses data sourced from cotton export reports from various issues of the English/French language financial newspaper The Egyptian Gazette over the course of the year 1905. Specifically, the data looks at the amount of cotton exported to certain countries on a monthly basis.\nWhen discussing the history of modern Egypt, the development of cotton manufacturing is an invaluable topic. Mohamed Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, first encouraged commercial cotton production in Egypt in 1822. With the arrival of cotton came the arrival of finance in Egypt, as European banks encouraged Ali and his successors to borrow at exorbitant interest rates to modernize Egypt, with huge sums of capital coming from the new cotton trade. The most dramatic effects of this irresponsible borrowing came into play when Egypt came under rule of Mohamed Ali’s grandson, Ismail. Ismail wished to turn Cairo into the “Paris on the Nile” through extensive investment in Egyptian infrastructure, borrowing even greater sums of money from European banks, and the opening of Suez Canal. Though the combination of these revolutionary factors did modernize Cairo and the rest of Egypt to great lengths, they also sealed Egypt’s fate of colonization by the French and British. Ismail became so indebted to foreign banks and financial entities that England and France forced him to abdicate in 1879 and once again claimed Egypt for their empires, this time as a single-crop colony capable of producing trade and profit in the modern world through its extensive cotton production.\nThe Egyptian Gazette is a very interesting resource in regards to this topic as it provides extensive data on various cotton-related exports and trade during the year 1905. The data sources I have chosen provide monthly reports, mainly because the summative nature of these reports is an attribute which I find useful for examining macroeconomic trends. These monthly cotton tables also provide the destinations of the bale exports, something which provides digital historians such as ourselves many unique and fun ways to present and play with the data to build a cumulative picture on international trade. Building this larger picture from the ground up is an exercise which I believe resonates with the main goal of this course.\nI used the Tableau software to create the graphic visualizations of my data. The first graphic shown here shows the countries that received cotton exports from Egypt. The depth of the blue shading indicates the relative ranks of these countries in terms of how many bales were exported to them. The box graphic below shows the total number of bales and their relative size to one another in more detail. Not surprisingly, the United Kingdom by far received the most exports, almost 160,000 bales in total. This is roughly six times greater than the second most popular export destination, France, with almost 26,000 bales in total.\nThe first conclusion I derived from this data is that England was clearly the dominant colonial power not just when it came to ruling Egypt, but when it came to extracting its resources. No other country even came close to receiving as many cotton bales as England over the course of the year, in fact, England’s cotton exports outnumbered the total cotton exports received by all the other countries put together by quite a considerable margin. This analysis, of course, is limited just to Egyptian sources of cotton and does not speak to the relative economic power or consumption of these countries. However, it does at least show that in the case of Egyptian cotton, one of the world’s largest cotton markets at the time, England reigned supreme.\nIt is also interesting to note the global powers that received the most exports besides England, specifically, France, Germany, Russia, Austria, and Italy. These powers were at the time still the dominant global forces in European and world affairs. England’s preferred exportation relationship with these powers speaks to the nature of the international relations at the turn of the 20th century. Primarily, it suggests that England and its British Empire were the most powerful and important international entity at the time. This claim is supported by the fact that so many different powers around the world chose to export resources from an English colony, including Russia and Japan which were at war with one another at the time.

The paper covered a range of topics anywhere from the daily necessities such as weather reports, stock exchanges, and market prices, to bold current event storylines. Records of this newspaper are stored on a series of microfilms, or a length of film containing a series of microphotographic images of each issue. Over about a fifteen week period, these microfilms were scanned through a reader, resulting in digital images far more commonly used in today’s times. From these digital images of the newspaper, structure and components of each issue were confounded into a searchable database through the use of an OCR scanning software, which could take the digital images and produce a textual file. With these text files, countless forms of coding and labeling could be utilized to better understand the abundance of information being dealt with. Specifically analyzing the full year’s issue of 1905, the micro history of Egyptian culture was a seemingly endless database of stories and information of the early twentieth century. One of the most interesting aspects of this form of research involves analyzing the point of view of the Egyptians during this time, especially in the face of global conflict. While this time period was not necessarily the most gruesome in history, conflict throughout Europe and Asia was still prominent. The most major militaristic involvement of this time period involved the Russo-Japanese War, as well as the ripples of effects it had on European superpowers, as well as the Egyptians themselves. In a far less globally connected world during this time, Egypt played a sort of third party neutral nation, as is evident in the analysis of the paper. The writers of the Egyptian Gazette seemed to personify a consistent mentality throughout the nation of Egypt, being aware of global affairs, yet seemingly only interested in remaining neutral in the pursuit of national economic benefit.\nThrough the coding and labeling of the full year of 1905 in a single and complete database, querying for specific keywords, data tables, or quantities produced rapid results. In the pursuit of better understanding the effects European and Asian powers had on the Egyptians, looking into the development of certain treaties between nations led to plenty of results. A consistent theme throughout the duration of the year was the following of Japanese and Russian relationships, and along with these two, the nations that had ties to them via treaties. Along with the names of a number of these treaties, keywording specific city names where these treaties were signed produced a number of results. As the storyline of the Russo- Japanese War was closely followed, points of battle and city names opened the door to even more relevant data regarding global diplomacy. Finally, through querying the headings of the year’s issue regarding these keywords, large sections of data were discovered containing the writer’s views of the effects these global affairs would have on the Egyptian people, as well as what they believed the best course of action would be in response.\nFrom the compilation of these treaties, city names, and places of war through querying, a number of potential visual representations were available. In the case of this analysis a map was produced marking the location of major treaty signings and major battle points, along with a brief description of the situation at each location. This was done through utilizing a data interpreting software called Palladio. From the querying results, the locations of these major events were plotted in a geocoding program, which would return latitude and longitude coordinates to be displayed on a world map. This coordinate plotting was done on an add-on software to google sheets called ezGeocode. After inserting excel table data including the location name, the coordinates, the name of the event, and a brief description, an interactive map capable of zooming and scrolling was produced. In order to view the map the text string at the end of the paper must first be copy and pasted into an editing software and a file saved.\nAfter this, clicking the following URL link will open a page where this saved file can be loaded for viewing. While the Palladio software is very good at interpreting data, there is no form of saving customized tables or graphs, making this process necessary. The map provides a simple visual aid to help better understand global affairs of the time, as well as set the stage for the analysis of the writers’ views of these global affairs.\nThrough the compilation of all these global affairs topics, it is much easier to look into what exactly the effects these affairs would have had on the everyday Egyptian citizen, as evident in the stories composed by the writers of the Egyptian Gazette.

I was clueless to what defines the cattle plague, and wanted to learn more about how it affected Egyptians in 1905. I am also asking this question because general epidemics of serious health conditions were becoming a problem with morality rates in Africa and Asia. We know medicine back in the early 20th century was not advanced enough to work on containing or reducing epidemic situations, and not able to establish herd immunity as we do today. The information found within the Digital Egyptian Gazette can provide exact numbers of mortality rates amongst populations, locations of where the epidemic of cattle plague has spread, detailed case stories of cattle plague, issues relating to the trading crisis, and delays in societal progression.\nTo begin with, what exactly is Cattle Plague? Well, cattle plague is classified as one of the ten deadliest plagues found in Egypt. It is an infectious disease of cattle and can spread through either a direct mode of transmission from the cattle, or through an indirect mode of transmission, such as drinking contaminated water, or breathing in contaminated air particles. Because of the lack of immunizations to cattle plague, or several other plagues, almost anyone was a susceptible host to cattle plague. Symptoms would include fever like conditions, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and the obvious result of high rates of death due to this variety of deadly conditions of the cattle plague. Cattle plague, also known as Rinderpest, originated way back in Asian countries around B.C. ages.\nRinderpest did not reach Egyptian grounds until 3,000 BC, and was recorded on Egyptian papyrus and tablets. In the year of 1905, as mentioned in the dated Digital Egyptian Gazette, cattle plague was only an acute outbreak of infectious disease by this time. However, there was a previous massive epidemic of cattle plague in the 1890’s, affecting most African countries and causing lifestyles to change. For example, the trade crisis was mentioned in an April issue of the Digital Egyptian Gazette (April 24, 1905). The trade crisis occurred for several reasons, however, two highlighted reasons included a fall of cotton products and the loss of cattle products due to the cattle plague. With this, traders were having much difficulty in receiving payments from customers, due to the most recent loss of goods needed for trading purposes. Specifically with the cattle plague epidemic in the 1890’s, markets were closing down, making it difficult to reopen safe markets, and recover from lost resources. Especially, if the cattle plague was still a reoccurring issues and mortality rates were still increasing by the few hundreds.\nIn order to find the data and information needed for my analysis on cattle plague, I am querying the text for terms such as: “cattle”, “plague”, “mortality”, “trade” and “bubonic plague”, to compare the information of those affected by both plagues during the year of 1905. After searching with each key word, I found that Cattle Plague mostly affected the Egyptian Market Companies, being closed for over two year due to outbreaks of cattle plague, as mentioned in an issue of the Egyptian Gazette in October (October 4, 1905). As a result to the markets reopening, The Sanitary Departments have been ordered to inspect to make sure that the plague has been reduced and will not be an issue in the markets any longer. Many believed the plague was “over” and has “almost disappeared”, as stated in issues of the Egyptian Gazette, published first in April (April 26, 1905) and later found in another October issue (October 4th, 1905). Although, mortality rates were reducing by 1905, that does not mean the issue cattle plague has been erased.\nIn my visualization chart, provided as an attachment to this analysis paper, the Cattle Plague mortality rates are recorded since the epidemic began. Unfortunately, the Digital Egyptian Gazette was very limited on these values, only providing data from a time spam of a two month difference. However, these values still remain of interest because they are still the total number of deaths due to the cattle plague within three important Egyptian regions: Gouvernorates, Lower Egypt, and Upper Egypt.\nAccording to the Digital Egyptian Gazette, mortality rates were recorded in the months of May and July. According to the data found in a May issue of the Digital Egyptian Gazette (May 29, 1905), three deaths were noticed within that week due to cattle plague. 543 deaths were noted since January of that year which also shows cattle plague was still …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"0a3bcb65eeb7d2df2e27d919be8cdf3b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-vazquez/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-vazquez/","section":"post","summary":"In discussing reoccurring issues within the Digital Egyptian Gazette, several medical conditions were mentioned, affecting the people of Egypt and beyond.

The Egyptian Gazette contained a great deal of all happenings within and around Egypt. In the year of 1905, The Egyptian Gazette contained information about the political doings of leaders within and around Egypt, news (or gossip) about the royalty in Egypt, and a expansive volume of information about the prices and import/export information of many different scarce resources. This was of interest to people in politics, business owners, and investors. This sparked an initial interest due to the fact that information such as, the prices of resources, or the amount imported or exported were translating to how Egypt’s economy stayed alive at that time.\nOne resource that was imported to Egypt at that time was coal. Coal had many uses within Egypt, but its main and most important use was for transportation. Many of the boats and trains throughout Egypt used coal to power their engines. This made coal one of the most important resources in Egypt. Interestingly enough, coal was primarily imported to Egypt for the majority of their coal use. Because of that, the amount of coal that was being imported through Egypt was vital as without these imports there would be no use of coal in Egypt. This is what lead the topic of research to become, “How much coal was imported into Egypt in the year 1905?”. This question is important as it gives insight to exactly how much coal was used throughout the seasons and when coal was needed the most. This data could also be transferred to other topics of consideration considering the happenings within and around Egypt at that time.\nTo do this requires the word “coal” to be searched throughout each and every page. Then after finding those instances of the word’s use, information pertaining to the imports of coal will be recorded. By searching for imports of coal this way rather than using the search term “coal imports” or “imports”, will allow the broadest cases of the use of the word “coal” to be returned from the search term.\nThe information used will be from newspaper editions digitized by the peers in my Digital Microhistory course. Because of that, the amount of input concerning the import of coal varies from month to month. Also, because there is no input on the amount of coal being imported for the months of July and August, those months will be averaged out using the import amounts from June and September. The import amounts given are on a yearly scale.\nIn the first month’s issue of The Egyptian Gazette, import data was not available. But instead the finishing amounts of coal imported from January to December of the last year were given. This was due to the year being finished out and a new year beginning. The amount of coal that was being imported through January was not reported on as the number was insignificant until the month of February. But, the amount of coal that was imported into Egypt from January 1, 1904 to December 31, 1904 was 1,057,441 tons. Of the 1,057,441 tons imported, Newcastle exported 240,694 tons, Wales exported 594,774, Yorkshire exported 58,375 tons, and coals imported from all other places amounted to 48,307.\nFebruary was the first month that coal import information was given. From January 1,1 1905 to February 2, 1905 32,338 tons of coal were imported in to Egypt. Of the 32,338 tons imported 19,804 tons were imported from Wales, Newcastle exported 5,833 tons, Scotland exported 4,668 tons, and 247 tons were imported from all other places. In the same period last year 60,417 tons of coal were imported into Egypt.\nCoal imports had a steeper increase in April with 194,330 tons being imported into Egypt from January 1, 1905 to April 13, 1905. 45,082 tons of the imported coal came from Wales, 45,082 tons of coal were imported from from Newcastle, 22,749 tons were imported from Scotland, 13,901 were imported from Yorkshire, and other places exports 6,644 tons in total. During the same dates in 1904, 324,589 tons of coal were imported into Egypt.\nFrom January 1, 1905 to May 4,1905 coal imports increased to 281,462 tons. Of the 281,462 tons of coal imported, 146,032 were imported from Wales, 68,434 were imported from Newcastle. 36,412 were from Scotland, 16,466 were from Yorkshire, and other places exported 13,118. At the same period in 1904 the amount of coal imported totaled to 369,165 tons.\nFrom the beginning of 1905 to the beginning of June in 1905 Egypt imported 361,183 tons of coal. Wales exported 68,434 tons into Egypt while Newcastle exported 68,434. Scotland exported 45,329 tons, Yorkshire exported 21,221 tons, while all other areas exported 15,243 tons of coal into Egypt. In 1904 during the same time 416,405 tons of coal were imported into Egypt.\nBecause there is no data input on imported coal in July and August the figures is an average amount based on the subtraction of the June amount of imported coal from the September amount of imported coal.\nThe …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"758b887418c2f44969121d3c0dafdcbc","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-heyward/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-heyward/","section":"post","summary":"1905 was a prosperous time for Egypt and the Egyptian Gazette has the information to prove it.

This newspaper served many purposes. It kept its citizens up to date on current events in business and their personal lives both in Alexandria and worldwide. For my digital micro-history project, I decided that the best way to understand the daily lives of the people living in Alexandria at the time is to investigate a section in the “Egyptian Gazette” titled “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK”. This section is included in every issue, typically on pages three or four. It lists the important events happening in Alexandria and its surrounding areas. This serves as a tool to keep its citizens up-to-date with what is happening in the town and advises them to go and participate in these events. By taking a further look into this section, we can see the types of things or event that the people of Alexandria enjoyed doing and which ones seemed to be very important to them.\nIn order to investigate the “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK” section in the “Egyptian Gazette”, you will have to gather research, which is a bit more challenging than expected. One of the biggest challenges you are faced with while completing a digital micro-history project is gathering enough research or data from your classmates. This means you are heavily dependent upon what another classmate has decided, or not decided to do. Many people faced issues when it came to converting digital images of the Egyptian Gazette to editable text. This resulted in many missing or unreadable pages over all. It order to convert a digital image of a page in the newspaper, you must run it through an OCR program. From personal experience, this is easy if you are working from a Windows computer. However, if you decide to work off a Mac computer, you will run into a lot more problems than what you had anticipated. OCR programs do not seem to get a long well with Mac computers. I have tried a couple different ones and both produce results that are so filled with errors that you are much better off retyping the entire page yourself. This is where the work becomes much more time consuming. While this may produce text with a significantly low amount of errors, you are less likely to fully complete all of the necessary pages of an issue. Most of my classmates encountered this problem because they use Mac computers, which resulted in a small amount of research for me to work with.\nWe also run into research inconsistences due to the fact that we were given loose guidelines. If you can successfully convert your digital image to editable text, then you can move on to converting your text to XLM. Because the guidelines for converting the plain text form of the newspaper to XML were not extremely specific and allowed some freedom, XML documents were created differently. Each person was allowed to organize his or her documents in a way that seemed to fit and make sense. This means that you have to run multiple quarry searches with slight differences between each in order to return the most results. Ideally, classmates would follow some sort of general guideline, but because that was not fully expected, it did not happen. This again, makes the work more time consuming and increases the chance of returning fewer results.\nAnother problem you can face when trying to complete a digital micro-history assignment is running a quarry. Running quarries is how you obtain your research from other classmates. If you are completely unfamiliar if XML or the program Oxygen, or you are the complete opposite of tech-savvy, then this step may be a but challenging if you are not sure what to type. In order to investigate the “CALENDAR IF THE WEEK” sections during the year 1905, I ran the following query: //head[contains(.,\u0026#39;Calendar of the Week\u0026#39;)]//following-sibling::row[]/cell[]/string(). As mentioned above, students were not required to follow any specific guideline when creating an XML document, so I changed “Calendar of the Week” a few different times to account for everyone’s different style of XML. I searched “Calendar of the Week”, “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK”, and “calendar of the week” in order to return as many results as possible.\nOut of a total of fifty-two weeks in a year, my quarry searches returned a total of sixteen different “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK” sections, each with completely different entries. Although this section of the newspaper does not change frequently, it is expected that there be at least one for each week. This low number of returned results can be attributed to classmates not being able to create a searchable XML document. It is interesting to note that all of the returned searches appear in the last half of the year, from September 6, 1905 to December 26, 1905. It is possible that the “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK” section was a new section introduced half way through 1905. Maybe as sort of a trial run to see how well their audience enjoyed it.\nThe “CALENDAR OF THE WEEK” sections in all returned results included events …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"be7efb4e37f41e9bd95b0b665b86c307","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-black/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-black/","section":"post","summary":"The “Egyptian Gazette” was a newspaper printed in Alexandria, Egypt during 1905.

These opinions formally come from the editors of the paper in the forms of editorials and the readers of the paper in the form of Letters to the Editor. Within the Egyptian Gazette in 1905, there are a wide selection of the Letters to the editor that were published and I wanted to examine them as a whole to hopefully gain some insight on what the readers of the Egyptian Gazette are concerned about. Were the primarily British readers more interested in the financial content of the newspaper? Alternatively, did they want make a point known about the culture in Alexandria at the time? What follows is an examination of peoples that are not talked about in the historical mainstream, not men with fancy hats who rule over others, but a more common folk.\nBefore starting, it would be beneficial to go over the process that I used to collect the data I found regarding these letters. Before I started querying the issues, I wanted to skim through multiple weeks to see what sections of the newspaper were common and had something that stood out to me. I look through my week, spanning from September 18 to September 23, along with the weeks that were finished up by some classmates I knew in class. Initially, I took interest in the analysis of orchestra performances in Alexandria, seeing what composers were most popular in the city and what groups were being utilized most often (military bands, community orchestras, national orchestras, etc). Querying for this information was inconclusive, even after extensive manipulation of the queries. This led me to pick the letters to the editor. They had a more common appearance in the paper and had a more standard lay out in the issues throughout the year. After compiling the most recently updated issues of the paper into a project in Oxygen Text Editor, I started querying multiple terms in the boilerplate header for the letters. I looked for terms such as “editor”, “free discussion”, and “fair play”, as these terms appeared to be more common in letters to the editor header than any other article I had read. This resulted in far too many results to look through, a lot of which had nothing to do with what I wanted to find, much of it reporting on rival newspapers or correspondents. I decided to be more specific, targeting the header itself using the //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\u0026#39;)] query. Not yielding the results I had expected, I decided to make it even broader and look in every div regardless of type using //div[contains(., \u0026#39;LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\u0026#39;)]. This worked fine, resulting in roughly 45 actual letters to the editor. Still expecting to see more I decided to look for more specifics in the boilerplate. I later found out that two boilerplates had been made for the heading of the letters to the editor. One the used “Letters” and another that specified a single letter “Letter to the Editor”. I queried that exactly headline using //div [contains(., \u0026#39;LETTER TO THE EDITOR\u0026#39;)] and managed to find an additional 20 letters. With a total of 65 letters accounted for, I decided to move into the analysis.\nAfter looking through each of the letters published in the newspaper, some things became apparent very quickly. The vast majority of these the people writing to the Egyptian Gazette utilize this section as a way to discuss Local/National problems. They most often respond to a previous issue of the Gazette and start posing an opposite viewpoint to what the writer of the paper wrote. One repeating occurrence in this section is complaints about the “savages” in Egypt, which, in most of cases, is referring to the non-educated native Egyptian population of Alexandria. In one letter, a Mr. “A. Mermaid” is complaining about the indecency of Arab families and Low-class Europeans near his bathing box. He finishes his rant: “Egypt is no doubt improving for the Egyptians, but the Egyptians are not improving it. Among the many things that Lord Cromer is having taught to the Egyptians might it not be advisable to include decency!!!”.\nAnother thing that seemed to pop up within the letters to the editor was the concern that many readers had regarding the treatment of animals. For example, during the latter half of May and early June, multiple letters were published regarding Pigeon Shooting. A sporting club in England had banned pigeon shooting and many readers were writing in to try to convince the Alexandria Sports Club to ban the sport as well. All of the letters published were in favor of banning the act, calling it a game rather than a sport. One thing that stuck out to me regarding these responses was that no one had included their real name as the writer, always using a pseudonym (some being comedic, such as “Disgusted”, “Clay-Pigeon”, or “British Pigeon”).\nAdditionally, the people who wrote to the editor of the …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"acb05a05650f33824e38bb51e5b7747a","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-amorello/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-amorello/","section":"post","summary":"Through the existence of newspapers, expressing opinions has become more acceptable and has developed over time into dedicating entire sections of the newspaper to it.

But I noticed one aspect of each issue that always caught my attention, the medical miracles. I would see personal accounts of Egyptian citizens telling their seemingly hopeless stories. “Severe rheumatism,” “kidney trouble,” and “poor appetite,” were just some of the bed confining ailments that were all suddenly cured by a magic box of pills. And these stories weren’t just present in my issues. I found them scattered throughout the whole year. The question I will be investigating is how successful really were these pills? I will be researching how many cases of medical success resulted from the Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in particular, over the course of this year. I will also go into further studies of the proclaimed brand and gain more historical and background knowledge of its origins and the pill’s chemical makeup. I hope to conclude how successful of a brand this really was and determine if it was as miraculous as the people of Egypt claim.\nI began my research by trying to gain a more conclusive background of the brand. Was it more natural or synthetic? What was the main ingredient? By sifting through countless pages I finally found my answer within the newspaper itself. Apparently Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were a more natural remedy than anything else. The medicine had been used by the Quakers for 72 years, comprised of “roots” and “herbs.” The pill acts as a stimulant to the kidneys, naturally aiding the filtration blood, and the flushing of surplus water and impurities in the blood stream. Even more specifically, the pills catalyze the dissolving process of crystallise I poisons. This can in turn cure, “Bright’s Disease, dropsy, rheumatism, urinary disorders, gravel, gall stones, sciatica, lumbago, weak heart, and diabetes,” or so the brand claims, I have attached proof of these claims in the following images.\nI however decided to conduct my own personal research. I did find that they were indeed comprised of natural ingredients,“purely vegetable” to be exact. I discovered this through a reliable web source, detailing the pill’s wrapper information and directions for use. I have provided a chart listing the pill’s components and the source from which obtained can be found in my works cited.\nI then decided to turn my attention back to the newspaper. Knowing that these pills were actually what they claimed to be, just how many cases of success were reported? And what did they all have in common? I began to search for a pattern. There were fourteen total features of the Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A few of the advertisements were purely informational. Including facts about the drug and symptoms it could treat. The others were actual patient accounts. I organized these based upon which condition or conditions they suffered from and claimed to have been cured. I then organized this into the following chart.\nThe results were astonishing. The drug did in fact treat a wide variety of diseases that it claimed to have. One of the most prevalent being kidney disease which is a very serious condition. I decided to research all of the diseases that patients claimed to have been cured from, and compare them to modern ways of treatment, I made several breakthroughs with this method.\nKidney disease cannot be treated by medication alone, it can ease symptoms by providing much needed vitamins, but it cannot actually cure kidney disease which is what these subjects claimed. Nowadays the only real cure is dialysis or kidney transplantation, anything else is just a cover up for the real issues at hand, only treating the symptoms and not the problem. Below I have included all of the cases of supposedly cured kidney disease within the issues and next to that I have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.\nRheumatism, unlike kidney disease can be treated with medication. There is no cure for this disease but anti-inflammatory drugs can make an unbelievable difference and ease joint pain greatly, so it is very likely that sufferers of this condition were actually assisted by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Again I have included all of the cases of cured Rheumatism within the issues and next to that I have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.\nBright’s Disease was another claimed ailment supposedly cured by these pills. Bright’s Disease is currently treated on a case by case basis because each underlying cause of disease is very different and there could be a wide range of causes for each unique person. However, it is greatly possible that the Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills did indeed assist in relieving symptoms in some cases, if the cause was inflammation of the kidneys and nothing else. So these claims are not discounted.

Murder is, unfortunately, more prevalent than society would hope. But how common was it a century ago? The Egyptian Gazette is my only way of finding any information on murders that occurred throughout the year of 1905. Surprisingly enough there weren’t many murders reported in the paper throughout the year. I was only able to find 10 murders and an attempted murder that was successfully thwarted. Aside from one murder in July, the rest of the murders occurred in the first four months of the year. I can’t be sure but the lack of reported murders throughout the rest of the year could have something to do with my classmates not finishing their xml files. Regardless there was still some interesting information about the murders that did occur. A pattern I saw was that there were periods of time where murders were not recorded but then there were times when multiple murders were reported in a span of a few days. An example of this is how 3 murders were recorded in January 4, the most murders in a single day, and the next time various murders occurred was when two occurred in February 7th and then another just two days later. The next time murders occurred so close to each other was when a murder occurred on April 14th and then another on the 15th. There were a few murders spread out between those 3, multiple murder, days. There was also one more murder after April 15th and that one occurred on July 28th. A consensus about these murders is that the culprits were all either caught or there was already a suspect in custody. The newspaper was not used to try and find a culprit or to advertise some info on the whereabouts of a suspect. I can see that part of the reason for that is that the police want to have a good reputation when it comes to solving crimes. If all the reported murders have been solved, then there will be faith in the system and potential murderers will doubt their chances of not getting caught. Unfortunately, though, there’s a high probability that there’s corruption within the police. Of course the odds of there not being corruption, especially a century ago when cops could get away with more than they do now, was slim but the newspaper proved my suspicions correct. On February 7th, a resident of Cairo wrote that he or she had just learned about an Armenian that was brutally beat by three natives and finally succumbed to his wounds after a week in the hospital. Apparently, nothing was done to apprehend or charge the assailants. In fact, a sergeant had been bribed to let them go and throw the case under the rug. Of course this came from an anonymous person and can’t be seen as legitimate but it does raise suspicions because someone wouldn’t go through all that trouble over some unreliable information. The person that supplied the information must have been reliable but not able to do anything because going against the police is a dangerous thing to do. I do wonder if it was ever looked into because calling the police department like that must have been seen as defiance. No update came out on the issue so maybe it was successfully thrown under the rug. This raises some big questions on how much is being covered up by police and even the newspaper. We don’t know if the police filter anything regarding themselves to make sure it’s all positive. The fact everything regarding them is positive, except the inquiry request I mentioned recently, says everything because no matter how good the police is, there will be unsolved murders. Especially since there wasn’t as much technology back then like the important fingerprint identifier. Out of the other murders, a consensus is just how petty people can be. People killed for more insignificant things back then than they do now. An example of this is from January 13th. A rich man had reported his 5-year-old daughter missing after she never returned home when she left to go play with other kids her age. The poor girl was found dead in a pit. The police found the alleged killer, who was a servant named Hamad, even though she accused her husband of the murder. The ridiculous motive for the murder was a pair of earrings. An innocent 5 year old girl was unnecessarily killed for a pair of earrings. People back then were ruthless because there was no need to kill the girl after taking her earrings. This is the one murder that outraged many and the paper specifically states that it enraged many. It was probably the little girl’s age and motive for murder that had all those people enraged. Another petty murder occurred on January 4th. The murderer had lent a sum of money, P.T. 50 (I don’t know how much that is), to his uncle but every time he asked for the money back, his uncle would ask for more time. He couldn’t take it anymore and went to his uncle’s house and used a knife to kill his uncle. Maybe because of adrenaline or rage or because she was just there as an …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"a48054b13acc8ea311e71b03818b78c3","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-barbosa/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-barbosa/","section":"post","summary":"Death is a common thing that happens to everyone but murder is an unnatural way for death to come.

Granted I only had a tiny section of the newspaper in the year 1905 but still I expected more on such a catastrophic disease. This curiosity presented itself to be the perfect serial question for me to explore. I wanted to know if the plague was reported on more thoroughly in any other issues during that year and how widespread the disease was. Was it just affecting Alexandria or was it also spreading throughout Egypt. To do this I queried the newspaper and researched outside sources.\nExploring the reporting of the plague wasn’t easy. I started off by just querying the word plague across all of the pages of the newspaper in the year 1905. What I got back was a broad result of articles with the word plague I them. In searching this I even found that there was a cattle plague going on at the same time. The disease affecting people was coined ‘plague’ and the disease affecting cattle was coined ‘epidemic’. I came to the conclusion that the two did not intertwine and were separate affairs. Next I chose to query the headline “Bubonic Plague”. Most headlines are in all caps so I had to search that phrase in all caps since the query is case sensitive. That gave me a lot of useful results. It was then that I started to see a pattern about which the plague was reported on in the newspaper. The plague was usually reported on every other day or so. It was reported on in usually the local and general section and it was under bulletin records. The bulletin records showed how many cases had been reported to date and how many of those were fatal. The bulletin report also gave information as to where the plague was spreading. When I discovered the bulletin report section in the newspaper I proceeded to query the words “bulletin report” in the paragraph tags. This was probably the most useful query in that it gave me the best raw data of deaths due to the plague. Another query I used was epidemic. This one was probably the least useful. The epidemic query brought up results related to the cattle plague that was unrelated. Interesting enough though the cattle plague was very prominent in Alexandria in 1905 and in Egypt itself. 1905 seemed to be the year of the plague. The last query I used was “fatal cases”. This allowed me to find only fatal cases of the plague rather than all the cases reported. This was important for me because I made a graph showing the deaths due to the plague per month. The graph helped me get a better grip on when the plague was thriving in 1905 and when it had died down. At the beginning of 1905 the plague was at its peak. As the year progressed the plague deaths decreased significantly.\nBy using these methods of research I found a lot of evidence to help me reach a conclusion in my research. From the information in my newspaper the plague was already thriving at the start of 1905. In the prior year (1904) a total of 843 cases of the plague were reported, 501 of which were fatal. From the looks of these numbers it seems that the plague had been going on for quite some time. The plague was so catastrophic that American newspapers also reported about the plague in Egypt. In a New York newspaper they used the headline “Horrible affair in Egypt: bones and brains everywhere”. While that headline might have made a good horror movie title, the plague in Egypt was far from fiction. Monthly deaths were occurring at an alarming rate. At the beginning of 1905 the plague seemed to be at its peak taking around 13 lives in the first few weeks of January. This primarily shows how strong the plague was thriving in the past months of 1904. In the last week of December 1904, there was a spike in the number of cases of plague reported. This wave of increase in plague cases looks like it made its way into the New Year as well. This was occurring mostly in part because the plague was very contagious. I discovered in the newspaper that people started to get infected by the plague by the goods coming into the country mostly from India. Along with India, goods from Upper Egypt like beans were contaminated and being brought over into the area. The disease had infected the goods because dead rats had been around the food for weeks. An infected rat would try to eat some of the goods and then die from the illness. Nobody would really notice and the disease would then spread to the goods and then to the people by them consuming the goods. Also treatment for a disease of this magnitude wasn’t the best in 1905. So people were getting sick faster than they could be cured in some parts of Egypt. I also discovered that the plague was not exclusive to Alexandria. The disease had …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"091a3f3d793b0c9ef260da21bd63a620","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-corzo/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-corzo/","section":"post","summary":"The Egyptian Gazette has been one of the most respected and successful newspapers in Egypt for decades.

In the article about the game, all that they included was the date of the game, who played, the location, and the score. I would like to figure out all of the sports that they played, where they played them, how they organized them, how big the fan base for these sports were, and how competitive the games between teams were. The answers to these questions can give us a vast insight into what their society was like. The best part is that the answers to all of these questions can be found within the text of this newspaper. You may be wondering how finding out information about sports will give us any insight into what it was like back then. Well, for starters it will show us how the world functioned, what people care about, how they spend their free time, where popular places to live were, and how influential sports were to the people back then.\nFor example, our society today is very sports oriented. There are a very large amount of die hard fans for collegiate and professional sports programs. People who dress up like their team’s mascot and are proud to walk around like that. The players on these big football, basketball, soccer, hockey, and baseball teams are praised and treated like gods, getting paid millions and millions of dollars to perform out on the field and do what they love. People are very passionate about their teams and will pay lots of money to see them succeed. Besides all of the money and pride that goes along with sports today, a lot of small talk and conversation starters are about the games that are being played on television that day. Some long term friendships are made off of a simple “Hey, did you see the dolphins game last night? They played better than ever.” Before you know it the two are keeping in constant contact with each other about football, then eventually it leads to a deeper friendship that they never say coming. If I could find out what sports meant to these people back in 1905, we could figure out additional information about what it was like to live back then. The information found could also be used to find out how much income people made off of sports. It will be interesting to see if sports and large amount of money went hand in hand back then like they do now. The other questions such as where they played, and how competitive the games were are also very important. If we find out where most of the games take place, or where they hold the championship games for every sport, then we could possibly find out what the sports capital of 1905 was. The sports capital would probably have a higher population, which means that more money would be flowing through that town, therefore it would probably be one of the more affluent places to live.Do you now see how much information we can squeeze about these basic questions involving sports? We can take this information, along with all of the other information from my classmates, and use it to help us get a better grasp on their society. Eventually we will have a much greater understanding of Alexandria in 1905, which is our overall goal in this class.\nIn order to find out this information, I gathered all of the data that students in this class have created, made them into one big project, and searched all of the xml files for keywords like “football”, “sport”, “rugby”, and “score” through the XPath query box using //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;cotton\u0026#39;)]. These key words led me to passages talking about a variety of different sports and events. After going through multiple pages of text, I have found a significant list of sports that were played or observed back in 1905. We have no way of knowing for sure that these are the only sport that went on and that were cared for back then. These are only the sports that were listed and talked about in the 1905 edition of the Egyptian Gazette. The list includes, but is not limited to, rugby, football, soccer, racing, hunting, shooting, cricket, running, rowing, swimming, tennis, golf, and horse races. From what I can tell, the most popular sports are football, soccer, and various types of races.\nThe writer of the newspaper usually posts an article that includes the time of kick off, location of the game, teams competing, and projected quality of the game, based on their past games played that season and which of their players is injured that week, a couple of days before the game is played. Another event they host that was written about in the newspapers is football tournaments. I have read about a multitude of tournaments between teams. They also write about the game after it has been played. They give a very in depth description of several aspects of the game.

One topic that is very prevalent throughout the newspaper is disease. This specific topic is interesting to look at because diseases in 1905 are very different from present day diseases. The use of a simple query search was done pertaining to different types of diseases. The //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;insertword\u0026#39;)] was used to search for a list of all item-type divs throughout the entire Egyptian Gazette. The simple search included different words such as “diseases”, “illness”, and “fever” which were used to produce results relating to diseases during the year of 1905. The results from this search then revealed other terms such as “plague” or “enteric” through the process of clicking through the results and reading through each individual item-type div that included passages about “diseases”, “illness”, or “fever”. From there another simple search was done using the same div but inserting more specific words like “plague” or “enteric”. A table, shown in figure 1, was created to compare and contrast the amount of results returned for each specific term. For example, there were 82 results for the word “plague” and 4 for the word “enteric”. Therefore the table exposed that the Plague was a more prevalent disease in the Egyptian Gazette. This brought about a serial question pertaining to disease. “How often did the Egyptian Gazette report specific cases of the Plague in 1905? And how many cases were specifically reported compared to the actual amount of cases that occurred?\u0026#34;\nfigure 1 Although the simple search returned 82 results pertaining to the Plague, this number itself did not reveal specific details about the Plague. This search narrowed down the entire Egyptian Gazette contents to the 82 articles that contained information about the “Plague”. It was through the process of clicking through each individual result one by one and reading the different articles about the “Plague” that exposed more information that could potentially answer the serial question. Some of the item-type divs had details regarding different cities that had specific reports of the “plague”. One common item-type div titled “Bubonic Plague” was used to report the different specific cases of the Plague and deaths, and recoveries of the disease. It was usually worded something like: “Yesterday’s plague bulletin records a fresh case, a death in hospital, and a cure at Suez, and a cure at Port Said.” From these details a simple table was constructed with the categories “where the Plague was reported”, “amount of specific cases reported”, “amount of deaths reported”, and “amount of recoveries/cures reported”. For each new place mentioned in the articles a cell was created for it. For example, cases of the Plague in Alexandria had been mentioned multiple times throughout the newspaper articles so there was “18” under “amount of specific cases reported”, “6” under “amount of deaths reported”, and “15” under “amount of recoveries/cures”. There were 21 different places that were mentioned having reported specific cases of the Plague. This table was used to add up the amount of cases, deaths, and recoveries throughout Egypt during 1905. A pie chart was then created to display the overall amount of Plague cases, deaths, and cures. Depicted in the pie chart, in figure 2, the blue portion being “cases reported” shows there were 76 all together. As for the green portion it reveals there were 37 “recoveries reported” and for the red there were 12 “deaths reported”. This diagram reveals the overall 125 specific cases of the Plague reported. This answers the “How often did the Egyptian Gazette report specific cases of the Plague in 1905?” With the answer being 125 specific cases, the curiosity as to how many actual cases occurred during 1905 was brought about.\nfigure 2 The question “How many specific cases were specifically reported compared to the actual amount of cases that occurred?” was answered in a similar way to the first question. From the simple search using //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;Plague\u0026#39;)] the 82 results that were read through revealed not only specific cases mentioned but also the overall number of actual cases that occurred. In the article “Bubonic Plague” from August 25, 1905 it states: “The total number of cases from January 1 to date amounts to 258, as compared with 804 during the corresponding period of last year”. In other words, this article reveals that there were 258 cases overall. Compared to the 125 cases that were specifically reported in the Egyptian Gazette there were 258 cases. This answers the question that compared to the actual amount of cases there were 133 cases that were not specifically reported throughout the newspaper. Whether the cases were not specifically reported or if they were just not entered into the Egyptian Gazette is unknown.

While the former of these is more of a satirical remark on governmental practices, the latter is a very real thing. Whether it be the worry of meeting an early end on your morning commute or worrying about your weight, death colors most things in life a little darker. In modern society, death is viewed in a multitude of ways. There are those who mourn it, those who celebrate it, and those who treat it as merely a part of life, and this last approach tends to be more common in societies where death itself is more prevalent. Take the early 20th century for example, death was more common, and the rather lackadaisical view of it is prevalent in the writings of the time. The Egyptian Gazette that we have been examining over the course of the semester presents the death of the citizens of Alexandria in this way, but rather than cover their methods, I am more concerned with the deaths themselves. Put simply, I want to find out how many deaths occurred in Alexandria in the year of 1905. In this essay, I will start out by giving a more in depth explanation of this question before moving on to my search methods then move on to the examination of my research.\nAs I stated in my introduction, the goal of my research is to see how many people died in the city of Alexandria during the year of 1905. However, my research does not merely stop there. Once I have determined the number of the deaths, I want to categorize them. So far, from my preliminary research, I have been able to formulate four basic categories; disease, murders and executions, suicide, and other. The disease category is rather self-explanatory, it includes all citizens killed by disease during the year. Murders and executions I grouped together because most, if not all, of the executions reported on by the Gazette were due to murders. Suicide I believe to be another rather self-explanatory category. It includes the suicides that happened in Alexandria over the given time period. The final category is a bit of an oddball. It includes all other deaths that happened in Alexandria in 1905 whether they be drownings, accidents, or natural causes. I ended up using this sort of “catch-all” category because I found that there were a large number of random or odd deaths that didn’t really fit into their own category. My original plan after completing this stage of the analysis was to build a map and place a color coded marker at the location of each incident. This could have, in theory, allowed me to draw further conclusions in the realms of epidemiology, criminology, and even possibly psychology, but I was unable to find enough locations within the paper to create a both visually appealing and accurate map. In lieu of this concept, I decided to develop a set of charts to display what percentage of the total deaths each category is. I also plan on breaking the “other” category up in its own separate pie chart to display the more unusual deaths that Alexandria experienced during the course of the year.\nThe way that I obtained my results was honestly really quite simple, but it did require a bit more leg work on my part than it probably should have. I started with a simple Xpath query, //div[contains(.,’death’)]. I received huge blocks of text, sometimes hundreds of lines long, and would have to sift through it all to find the information I needed. This would simply not work. I quickly decided to change the query with which I was searching. I started searching using the code “//p[contains(.,’died’)]”. This refined search ended up giving me 175 initial results, honestly less than I had expected. I spent the next hour or so going through them, removing the ones that were out of scope or did not pertain to my question from the results until I ended with roughly twenty or so final results from this search and around forty or so deaths. This was honestly much lower than I expected to find with such a broad term, but I figured my results would grow quickly. From here I went with the “//p[contains(.,’died’)]” query and replaced the term “died” with the terms “killed”, “plague”, “death”, “fatal”, “death”, “drowned”, “murdered”, “executed”, and “obituary”. I played around with the query a little bit by changing “p” to “head” in a few of the searches. I did this because I found that some of the terms, primarily “fatal” was much more prevalent in the header of articles rather than the articles themselves.\nHowever, after altering the query and searching for the terms I was only able to confidently record seventy deaths. This was a rather disappointing development for me as I expected at least a hundred, but was unable to do this confidently. Regardless, the final results are presented in the pie chart below.\nAs the chart clearly shows, disease is the number one killer. This was honestly not that surprising, however, what was surprising was what type of diseases were killing the people of …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"117cdb21d5870d40a5efb43532cebc2f","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-thompson/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-thompson/","section":"post","summary":"Benjamin Franklin once said that there are only two certainties in life, taxes and death.

What were the causes of these fires? What methods where used to subdue these fires?\nPersonal Findings: In my week of the Gazette I came across a ship that caught on fire. This report was found on page 3 of November 25,1905. The ship was full of cotton and rice when it was set aflame. Flames were not visible but smoke was 1pouring out from the vessel. The smoke calmed due to incessant pumping for about two hours. Soon after the ship fire seemed to be controlled, the smoke began again. Two hours later, it was decided that the ship was to be put ashore, on the bank in hopes that the hold would fill with water to subdue the fire. This did the trick and finally calmed the fire upon the ship. Oddly, the cause of the fire is reported as, “unknown.”\nThis section of the newspaper seems to report the most severe of fires. I am curious, as to what the other weeks of the Egyptian Gazette will have to offer about such fires. I wonder if the Gazette often lists the causes to these fires as “unknown”, as it did on page 3 of November 25, 1905.\nPeer Data Visualization: While searching through the pages of the Gazette, I found many references of fires in Alexandria. This includes:\nOn January 24,1905 in the General Strike at Moscow there was a fire at a Telephone Office. “Fire at Telephone Office.—At about 10 o’clock last night a fire broke out in the telephone central office at Kom el-Dik, which caused a complete interruption of the lines connected with this office. The Telephone Company inform us that they will re-establish communication as early as possible.” (Gazette).\nOn January 10,1905 in the Local and General section of the Gazette a Fire broke out in a shop. “The shop contains a store of chandeliers, lamps, etc., and there was also a considerable quantity of petroleum. It is the property of Count Jacques de Zogheb and was insured for £3,000. The cause is said to be due to a petroleum engine. There was a fire at the same shop three years ago, when it was completely gutted. The shopkeeper is a local subject, of the name of William Guttman. The alarm was given at 1.50 pm. and the engine was on the spot at 1.55 p.m. Owing to the petroleum the blaze and smoke were very great and it was two hours before the Brigade completely mastered it, although eight hoses were kept continually playing.” (Gazette).\nOn April 27,1905 a ship caught on fire in the canal. “This morning at dawn the S.S. “Candleshoe” arrived from the Canal having reported by wire from Station K. 64 the existence of a fire amongst the cargo in her No. 2 hold. On her arrival she was placed in the petroleum basin, which is situated some 2 kilometres from the town, and the necessary fire-extinguishing plant sent alongside. Throughout the day efforts were made to put the fire out by means of small quantities of water and other similar methods, with the idea of doing as little damage to the rest of the cargo as possible; but by 3 p.m. the fire had obtained such a hold that it was deemed neoessary, in order to save the ship, to flood the hold. The big fire float of the Canal Co., “Le Progres,” was already alongside, and she by means of her powerful pumps, had by 5.30 p.m. completely flooded the ’tween decks, in which it was found the fire had done most damage. By sundown, gangs of Arabs were at work discharging the cargo, and the ship’s main pumps were at work pumping out the water.” (Gazette).\nOn May 27,1905 in the Local and General section of the Gazette a Fire “Fire at Zagazig.-On Thursday night a fire broke out in the house of Sadik Bey. Abaza, a notable of Zagazig. The furniture of the house was destroyed, but fortunately the confiagration did not reach the neighbouring houses, and the moudir and the commandant of the police succeeded in isolating the fire, the origin of which is unknown.” (Gazette).\nOn September 30,1905 in the Local and General section of the Gazette a Fire broke out in a house. “Fatal Fire at Gabbari.—At 5 a.m. today a fire broke out in the upper story of a house in the Gabbari quarter. The fire bri- gade sent off an engine at once on being called up, and were engaged in putting out the flames whom the occupant of the house, a merchant named Abd el Rahim Hassan, threw himself from a window without waiting or a fire escape or ladder to be put up and received such severe injuries that he expired while being conveyed to hospital. The flames were quickly extinguished, and an enquiry as to the origin of the fire and the amount of damage done, is proceeding.” (Gazette).\nOn November 14,1905 in the Coal Cargo on Fire section of the Gazette a Ship caught on fire. “Yesterday the S.S Westburn (Captain Bell), of the Weathall Line, of Sunderland, arrived at Alexandria from Barry Dock with a portion of her cargo on fire.

Not only that, but my knowledge of computers in general has been greatly improved and expanded. Through the contents of this newspaper, I was given a unique perspective into the daily lives of the people who lived in Alexandria in 1905. While researching, I noticed that concerts seemed to be a very common event in Alexandria. The element of music in the lives of these citizens intrigued me, and caused me to wonder whether most of the musicians were local, or if they were more famous traveling acts.\nPursuing the Question in a Useful Manner To begin my pursuit of this question, I searched for instances of the word “band” in the paper for 1905 by using an Xpath query for //div[@type=”item”][contains(.,’band’)]. This proved to not be the most useful technique, as many advertisements for concerts do not contain the exact wording that a “band” is playing. This information seems to be implied. Additionally, I learned that sometimes the mention of a band can be in a context that does not serve my purposes whatsoever, and that the wording could be changed to improve the results of my search if I replaced “band” with “concerts.” I discovered that often times the musicians were never credited whatsoever, and that the artists behind the concerts described were sometimes left nameless, thus many advertisements never mentioned bands. In addition, many of the acts were orchestras or solo acts, not bands.\nThe discovery brought me to the realization that creating a logical way to retrieve the origin of the bands in question may prove to be a more difficult task than I previously thought. Were I confident that every act mentioned had been wrapped with a “PersName” type tag, or something similar and searchable, this would be quite a simple task. However, that is not the case. Many of these documents are partially written, and are full of errors that make this an unrealistic vision.\nIn order to still present a data set with a useful and relevant information, I decided to go through the instances where a concert is mentioned manually, removing any extraneous articles which were unnecessary for my purposes. This was a heavily labor intensive technique, but it allowed me to access the information I needed. By removing unwanted results, I was able to reduce my query results to 86 relevant items, and from that I could read through the articles and figure out where each musician is from.\nCritique of Programs Used and Challenges Faced Throughout my time doing research on The Egyptian Gazette, my main obstacle was technology. Oxygen XML Editor gave me countless issues, and although it is extremely likely that they were entirely fault, this still speaks to the accessibility of the program. In addition, it seems that the entire class struggled with the program, and perhaps there is a better XML Editor that would be easier for first time coders.\nNot only was Oxygen a faulty program, but also Cisem OCR gave me similar problems. The OCR was so poor that by the end of the semester, I gave up entirely on the idea of it and resolved to manually type out each page. I’m not sure if any other OCR converters are better, or if this is a common problem that needs to be solved within the industry, but I was extremely underwhelmed with the performance of this program.\nData Analysis and Cultural View figure One aspect of the data that immediately stood out to me was the amount of musicians mentioned. I was surprised that there was a large amount of people who played music in Alexandria during this period, seeing that in 1905 the first commercial flight was not for another nine years . Musicians from as far away as England (bands from both the English H.M.S. “Suffolk” and “Lancaster”) travelled to Alexandria, and according to the articles, were received well by the people who lived there. It seems that concerts were quite an integral part of society in Alexandria, and that it could be a profitable venture to travel there to take part in music.\nA notable musician mentioned is Signora Bellincioni, an opera singer whose appearance was described by the Gazette as “undoubtedly an event in the local theatrical world,” and “one of the most remarkable achievements in the art of music-drama that we have ever witnessed.” Admittedly, The Egyptian Gazette is hardly one for understating things, so it can be hard to tell if the reception was ever quite as dramatic as it was made to seem by the writers. However, it does seem that this is not a local musician, as the name is never mentioned in the paper again. Due to the dramatic nature of the statements made and the rareness of this name, it is safe to assume that this is a professional travelling musician with a notable amount of prestige and recognition.\nDespite the immediately apparent variety of musicians, after further research on the names which were not given a …","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"c93228107cfc63da17df4a4d61f1e0d1","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-ragland/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/16-analysis-ragland/","section":"post","summary":"#Intro and Question\nMy experience while researching The Egyptian Gazette led me to an understanding of a culture that I did not understand before.

This information takes many forms, and because the newspaper issues are from 1905, the newspaper’s structure and content can be confusing. However, this also provides an opportunity, the ability to explore. With over one hundred and fifty days of newspaper, a picture of life in Alexandria, Egypt at the time can be glimpsed. Some will choose to focus on stories and events. Others might spend their efforts looking at tables and making conclusions about Alexandria’s economy based on that information. While I initially shared those goals, I came to see a unique opportunity. After months of painstaking work, I wanted to do some analysis that could potentially help others long-term. As I began querying, I was immediately drawn to counting and the different ways that I could use it.\nOnce I decided to focus on counting, I immediately began familiarizing myself with XPath and exploring some of the simpler ways to use it. Initially, I used XPath to count simple things, such as advertisements, heads, or paragraphs on specific pages. I used count(//div[@n=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;]//div) to find the number of advertisements on each page 1. Then, I just altered this query in order to search for other general things, such as for person names with count(//persName).\nAs I kept trying to count advertisements, I became more and more frustrated. Each advertisement was only in each issue once at the most, and because of structural differences, counting them in bulk was almost useless. After struggling with advertisements, I shifted gears towards some of the financial tables. One table especially, the Export Manifests, intrigued me. The Export Manifests was structured differently throughout each issue. I came up with a specific query, count(//div//head[contains(.,\u0026#39;Export Manifests\u0026#39;)]//table//cell), in order to count the number of cells in each financial table. Unfortunately, structural differences struck again. Many of the issues contained heads beneath the one containing Export Manifests, causing the query to receive limited results. There is great potential for counting with advertisements and financial tables; however, for my purposes, I began at looking at the content of the paper for answers.\nAfter some thought, I used count(//div//p[contains(.,\u0026#39;Tokio\u0026#39;)]) to count the number of times Tokio was mentioned throughout each issue. This immediately gave results that I could potentially graph and analyze. When I inputted these results into excel, I quickly ran into another problem. Graphing over one hundred and fifty issues of newspaper in the same graph does not provide great results. After some searching, I found a much better avenue for graphing this information.\nAfter highlighting the dates and number of Tokio references, I clicked the Insert tab, then clicked in PivotTable. This PivotTable option organized the dates into months that can be expanded into days. For the sake of graphing, I kept the dates as months and made a bar graph depicting the number of Tokio references throughout the year of 1905. The Pivot Graph actually allowed me to change months into days or vice versa. I could change just the month of January into days and leave the other eleven months alone. This would be especially useful to pay special attention to any discrepancies or other interesting information.\nI then decided to use counting to find information that can be more easily analyzed. After some thought, I decided to make a bar graph comparing the number of times several words were mentioned throughout the newspaper. I initially thought of war as a major topic. Unfortunately, this led to a variety of other problems. While I was excited at first at the large amount of results, I quickly realized that the results were not all what I wanted. The first occurrence of ‘war’ actually took place within the word ‘forward.’ As I tried more queries, I could not manage to figure out a way to ask for only war. I conceded and just queried for words that would not provide mixed results. I decided to focus on economy, army, government, and irrigation for my graph. After getting all of my results into an excel spreadsheet, I created a bar graph showing how many times each of those words was mentioned in each month. The Pivot Table even gave a total for each word.\nAfter using Pivot Table to graph the data, I found that economy, army, government, and irrigation were mentioned 16, 193, 62, and 130 times respectively. The months of February, March, and April barely mentioned any of these words. While February and March were missing many issues, April was not. This might point to unfinished work or a boring time of year in Alexandria. Regardless, it is much more interesting to look at the the words “army” and “irrigation” later in the year. Army is mentioned the most throughout the year except for in the month of December. From the month of January to the month of November, army is mentioned almost twice as much as irrigation.

In the six issues that I started out working with, the stray dog article lists very little information, usually only the location they were collected and when they were to be poisoned by police. This leads to the question “Why is the ‘Stray and Ownerless’ section general news? And how does the information found in this section affect the social aspects of the city?” More specifically I want to look at the locations the dogs are being found as well as if any other issues (outside of mine) give more detail regarding this practice of poisoning stray dogs, like the reason it is done or an estimation of the amount of dogs taken.\nTo search through the Digital Egyptian Gazette I will mostly be using querying with specific words such as “ownerless” or “dog” in order to locate the specific articles I am trying to find. In particular, I have been using //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(.,\u0026#39;Stray\u0026#39;)] which usually brings me to the Local and General section of the files and from there I can locate the information I need. I may also use the querying to count the number of issues that contain this recurring message in the paper, I will do this by using the format “count(//div[contains(., ‘Ownerless’)])”. I chose the word ownerless because I figured the word “dog” may occur in other places in the newspaper, whereas “ownerless” will most likely only appear as the title of the articles for each issue. This should give an estimate (give or take some based on what was available when downloaded) of the amount of times the newspaper notifies the public about the stray dog dilemma.\nI began my searches using the query terms I previously mentioned but as I began searching I noticed only a few issues (15 different days) were providing results. Since they were all from the same months toward the end of the year, I considered maybe it was a recent thing they added to the paper, but after researching further I was able to find results from the stray and ownerless dog section for almost every month. I then used the query formula //p[contains(.,‘dogs’)], which not only gave me access to more months but also showed articles that gave information on the regulations that were to be implemented due to the over population of dogs.\nWhile querying through the Egyptian Gazette, I gathered a lot of information regarding the whole stray dog situation in Alexandria. In January of 1905 there was an article that explained the city had been trying to control the overpopulation of stray dogs by euthanizing them (with poison) when they were caught. The article said that the amount of strays was never really under control because no matter how many dogs were destroyed, more continued to come from Ghizeh and Galioubieh. A couple weeks after this was written in the paper, another article regarding the treatment of dogs was published. The second article stated that the city was trying to implement a new regulatory process in which the people of Alexandria had to get their dogs registered. This was later followed up in May when the paper briefly outlined the general idea behind the dog registration. The article announced that all registered dogs will be required to wear a collar with a “metallic plaque” that would be engraved with the dogs’ registration number. Any animals found without the collar were to be collected and held for five days. The contained dogs that were not claimed after the five days were sentenced to be destroyed. In July the government of Alexandria proposed that they were going to start reducing the number of stray dogs (through increased deaths by poison) and provide more funding toward institutions in Cairo that can cure rabies. I did some more research about this online and I found that there was a large increase in the amount of rabies cases starting in 1905. Around mid-November there was mention of even more regulations that were to be implemented starting in December. The next article I analyzed was published about a week after the previous one mentioned and it stated that fifty dog kennels were going to be built by the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Boulac and all captured stray dogs are to be given to the institution rather than going to the police station to be euthanized.\nI also composed a list of the top ten districts most mentioned in the Gazette for having stray dogs being captured (not in any particular order).\nBoulac Shoubra Sayeda Zenab Khalifa Old Cairo Abbassieh Waily Matarieh Gamalieh Darb-el-Abmar I found this topic interesting because you could briefly follow the process in which the city handled a minor social issue.

As I read, I found it interesting how tragic events were described in such different ways than they would be in today’s world. From murders to fires, the Egyptian Gazette covers them all. I would like to focus my attention on the events that occurred within 1905 in Cairo, Egypt that left astonishing and tragic results. It is interesting to me to see how the society went about these events and how the reactions after such an extreme event took place. I would also like to look at how the society dealt with these tragic events that occurred. In today’s world, when a murder or fire takes place, society freaks out. It is interesting to see that in past years, the year 1905 for example, some events were not as tremendous as they would be in the eyes of people today.\nWord searched|Number of items found|Descriptions Fire|403|Hotels, homes, buildings Poison|175|Dogs, people, many murders Murder|126|From poison, knives, etc. Knives|13|Murder, suicide, etc. Death|60|Many murders, advertisements\nI began my search by using key words to help my search results become clear and efficient. I queried the Egyptian Gazette by using specific key words. First I focused my attention on fires and used the search tool //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains( \u0026#39;insertword\u0026#39;)] to find specific results. I first searched the word fire and received four hundred and three results. For example, I got a result of the Pallada that was caught on fire. It was interesting to read on, as I learned that the Russians blew up the Sevastopol. It was similar to fire tragedies in today’s world, as many people were left wounded. It was a tragic episode and 15,000 people were left sick or wounded by the fire. Another episode that was discussed was a fire that broke out in a grocery store from a pack of matches. What I find interesting is that in today’s world cameras and employees have a code that must be accepted in stores so issues like this does not take place. I believe that since this event occurred over one hundred years ago, groceries and other stores did not have this specific policy. On December 28, 1905, using the item ‘fire’, I found a div about a hotel that was burned down. This incident was very common among the people of Cairo, Egypt. Also, many fire incidents happened to occur in homes, showing that people did not take much caution and fire departments were not as evident as in today’s century. I found another interesting story. The story described a native girl of six years of age whom was burned to death. I found this part of the article interesting because one, why was a child holding a candle, and two why would no one put the fire out? I am engaged by this concept, as this tragedy leads me to think that maybe at this point in time, parenting was not evident within this century.\nUsing the key word ‘fire’ made me come across other tragic episodes, leading me to use them as my quarry item word. For example, I came across a tragic event of dogs that were being poisoned and killed. This article really caught my attention, as it proved the obvious different time in century. In today’s 21st century, a person would not be allowed to just poison a dog because they were astray on the streets. This is why today we have pet shelters and the humane society. Not only, but this article then led me to use ‘poison’ as another search key word. When I used the key word ‘poison’ I got one hundred and seventy five results. Therefore, we must keep in mind that although one hundred and seventy results show, only a few are relevant to tragedy related articles. A lot of the results were ads that promoted medicines. These were not prominent to the search of poison being a key factor of tragedies that occurred.\nMurder, a huge crime committed among people of the 21st century, was evident in 1905 as well. By using the search tool //div[@type=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;][contains(., \u0026#39;murder\u0026#39;)], I got one hundred and twenty six results back. A story was exposed on January fourth 1905 of a man who murdered two people. After not being paid money, Keneh Markaz murdered his uncle and aunt. This crime was very similar to crimes that happen around the world on the daily. It is sad but true, that people must have had the same mental issues in the 19th century as they currently have in today’s world. This being said, a very strange story was found using the word ‘murder’. As I was looking through the divs, I came across a news story that explained a murder that occurred at a bar in Alexandria. What I found interesting was the fact that the murderer went and just stabbed the boys without any worry or fear. I feel like in todays world, murders take place with a scheme, plan, and in a private place. What I also found astonishing was that the news story did not describe any thing about what happened to the man that murdered the two boys.

The topic sparked my interest while I was coding the XML for my page threes. I am fascinated by sports and I noticed that there were reoccurring articles regarding horse racing and bets taking place around the races. The manner in which I plan to go about doing my analysis for my final project is querying the entirety of the Gazette for keywords like “horse” and “race” and “odds”. This will help me find what I am looking for in order to compile data to see who the most victorious race horse was. It would be very interesting to find the Secretariat of the early twentieth century.\n##Queries I will be using various queries listed on the how to tab on the Digital Egyptian Gazette website like listing all the “divs” by using the query: //div; listing all of the item-type “divs” by using the query: //div[@type=”item”]; listing all the item-type “divs” in your file containing specific words by using the query: //div[@type=”item”[contains(.,’word’)]; finding all tagged names of people by using the query: //persName; and finding all tagged names of places by using the query: //placeName.\n##Procedure My plan for accumulating my findings into a report will be consisted of the following steps. I will use the various queries listed above to find the information that I am looking for. First, I will attempt to find articles of text related to races, then use the keyword stakes, then horses to gather everything that I need to do my analysis. The way I will be judging just who the fastest horse in Alexandria is, will be by finding all of the races that went on during the year of 1905, identifying the names of the race horses, and tallying the number of wins (first place), places (second place), and shows (third place) of each horse. After I have done this, I will organize my data into a column chart using a template from Google Charts.\n##Data and Analysis At first, I did some research on horse racing and the gambling that goes along with the sport and I found that I did not find very useful information. For the most part, I discovered facts and figures that I was already familiar with. On the contrary, when I was querying the content folder of the Digital Egyptian Gazette for material related to my serial question, using the query //div [@n=”3”//p [contains (.,’stakes’), I came across the term, “furlong”, which I have never heard of before. According to LaurelPark.com, a furlong is equivalent to one-eighth of a mile, or six-hundred and sixty feet. Ergo, a stake that is twelve furlongs, would be a race that is a mile and a half long. I also used the queries, //div [@n=”3”//p [contains (.,’races’), //div [@n=”3”//p [contains (.,’horses’), and //div [@n=”3”//p [contains (.,’totalisator’). All of these keywords are mentioned in every single article related to the races.\nIn order to analyze my collected data, I developed a point system which gave each horse three points for every win, two points for every place, and one point for every show, and the horse with the most points would be deemed the fastest horse in Alexandria. There were a total of twenty-eight horses who competed in sixty-one races. Although, not every horse took part of every race, which might have caused for some slight error in my data.\nIn my data visualization, the first graph shows the number of wins, places, and shows and the second graph shows the number of points each horse received, using the point system described in the previous paragraph.\nThe three horses with the most points were Starboard Light with twenty-one points, Latiff with twenty-six points, and, the winner, Chinaman with twenty-eight points.\n##Issues with the Project During my time working on the assignments for this class, I used a wide variety of programs; some of which, worked to perfection while others, simply, did not. I would like to expound upon the reasons for the flaws of those of which I did not feel were effective in completing the workload.\n###Microfilm is a “Macro-Flop” The first step that I was instructed to do for this project was to go to the library and use the resources there to scan images of microfilm, which contained the Egyptian Gazette, in order to create a clean, crisp image of each page of my assigned week. This would’ve been easily obtainable had the microfilm not been of such bad quality. The pages that I scanned for my week were, lightly speaking, not the clearest. There were many blotches of black ink spattered throughout the columns and many characters could not even be recognized by the naked eye. Furthermore, some columns were not even visible and a lot of content was missing.\nThe program itself was difficult to use. A prime example of this claim is the fact that ScanPro 2000 is a quite outdated software and its controls were not optimal for what needed to be accomplished.

Additionally, the image of the page (that would automatically relocate to the plain text’s location when I selected it) that was always visible aided me in determining how exactly to structure the divisions to both best maintain the paper’s original appearance and take advantage of the power of XML coding to analyze it.

You think about how devastating the plague has been to the country… Wait there’s a plague? In the middle of the 1905 summer on June 16, the Egyptian Gazette reported that another person has died from the plague in a hospital in Damanhour. This report in the newspaper took up literally 2 lines and was probably over looked by the majority of readers. To me it seems that a widespread plague should receive a little more attention than that. Actually a lot more attention. What was the death toll at this point? How far had the plague spread? Are there any treatments being developed for the disease? What are the symptoms? All seem like plausible questions to be asked and reported on by the newspaper but haven’t been.

As a result, I have never seen a pro-cigarette advertisement a day in my life. And clearly, that reality differs from that of people who lived in Alexandria in 1905. Here, the Egyptian Gazette, on page three of this issue, is pushing the reader to check out an advertisement for the Cleopatra Cigarette Company, just in case they skimmed over it while reading page one just moments before. In essence, not only does the “Gazette” advertise for this cigarette company on the very first page of their newspaper, but they also refer the reader back to that advertisement in a later section of the paper, and in doing so, they are essentially advertising for Cleopatra Cigarettes two times in one issue. This just goes to show how lax people’s views on cigarettes were back in 1905. This newspaper “begs” the reader to check out an advertisement for cigarettes, hoping that they’ll end up purchasing the cancer sticks for themselves.\nThis is beautifully juxtaposed with modern society’s view on cigarettes. For one, in 2016, you would never find an advertisement for cigarettes in a local newspaper. Moreover, there are a plethora of campaigns in existence today which put out ads and commercials to influence people to not smoke, or to stop smoking.\nThis is just one example of the many types of ads in existence today, aiming to make society aware of the side effects of smoking cigarettes.

Well that’s precisely what one man of Makhadoora village did to his cousins in May of 1905. This nameless man injected compressed dates with enough of a deadly poison to kill those who ate it. He then gave these deadly fruits to five of his cousins, two men and three women.\nThe three women ate the dates and “expired in great agony.” Now if you are not a psychopath, you might be confused as to why this man decided to off his cousins and especially in such a cruel and painful way. Did they inherit a large sum of money from grandma while the killer only received the nice china? Did they eat all of the stuffing at Thanksgiving when they knew it was his favorite?\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of information provided about a motive or even a name for the killer, the world may never know.

The city of Alexandria was beginning to get its own sense of balance with opening opportunities to those employers looking for something more than labor. Education was essential for personal growth, however, businessmen often times could not spare even an hour or two to enhance their education. However, thanks to the Berlitz Schools, businessmen were able to work around their schedules to receive classes for those aspiring to learn English, French, German, Italian, and other essential language lessons.

The program found several errors for each page, so the process to edit was time consuming. However, after moving forward to the XML program, I can say I prefer XML/TEI programming over the ABBYY Finereader 12. This is because I am to look more into the text and learn more information, versus fixing grammar mistakes. With XML, reading the Egyptian Gazette is much easier because the program organizes the text with taggings such as \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;placeName\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;, and a variety of other tagging methods I have not even used yet.

Since I have a Mac laptop, I used the Cisdem OCR software rather than ABBY Finereader.\nThe first thing I would like to say is the accuracy with which it translates the text is quite disappointing. I would estimate that at MOST 60% of the original text was transcribed to my text editor properly, and even more frustrating was that specific letters were nearly almost incorrectly written, for instance the letter “e” for the entirety of the respective pages was often incorrectly recorded as the letter “a”, and vice versa. Furthermore, spell-checking entire pages written in French was both lengthy and difficult, particularly when I could not read some of the words and could not use context clues to figure out what they were supposed to say (because I do not speak French). At a certain point I had to simply accept that my XML pages were simply going to be filled with egregious errors and a certain level of accuracy was impossible to achieve (much to the chagrin of my mild OCD, but hey it was a learning experience in patience and Zen).\nOverall, I was not a fan of the OCR software. It was most likely faster than manually transcribing entire pages of the newspaper, but it was nonetheless aggravating and stressful.

In the midst of reflecting on what 39 tons of elephant tusks would look like, I noticed an odd source of ivory mentioned in the chart: “Sea Horse Teeth.” This piqued my curiosity, as I had no idea that sea horses were a source of ivory. I immediately began to scheme–I could open the first sustainable sea horse ivory farm. But in the midst of this, a problem arose. How does one extract sea horse teeth? Tweezers and a magnifying glass? That sounds like a painstakingly miserable job. Also the chart mentioned that 10 cwt. 1 qrs. 14 lb. (about 144 pounds) of sea horse teeth were delivered! How long would extracting that many teeth take? It might be a venture perfectly suited for the British Colonial project, but I realized I had much less capital to work with (also less forced native labor). It dawned on me that there is no earthly way that this chart is talking about the same sea horse that I am familiar with. A google search revealed I was not the first person to be puzzled about the true source of this ivory. This link describes a writer’s journey though old trade documents to discover what animal exactly is being referred to after encountering a similar reference to sea horse teeth, before finally realizing that sea horses don’t even have teeth!\nMisinformed Propaganda His conclusion was that it depended on the source of the shipment. If from the polar areas, it would be walrus, but if from Africa, it would be referring to hippopotamus teeth. I admit, in this context hippopotamus teeth makes a lot more sense. The word hippopotamus originally comes from Greek, and translates to “river horse,” while the genus of the seahorse, hippocampus, comes from the Greek words for horse and sea monster. It would seem perhaps that these animals were named a bit backwards. I haven’t been able to find official data on seahorse attack fatalities, but what I have read of hippopotamus’ make them seem far more monstrous, with one article quoting a statistic provided by the Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates foundation that the animal causes upwards of 500 fatalities a year. This chart also provides a snapshot of the global ivory trade before it was realized how much environmental damage was actually being done. See this link for a short documentary on the subject. So while my hopes for a sustainable ivory business might be dashed, I suppose the sea horses can rest easy for now.\n","date":1479686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479686400,"objectID":"af6612e3a3c8e82d352bb2d5d5268525","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-21-crawford-worldsworstjob/","publishdate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-11-21-crawford-worldsworstjob/","section":"post","summary":"Scrolling through the financial tables listed on January 9th, I came across a chart detailing ivory deliveries to London.

There are a few ways to score in rugby: try = 5 points, conversion goal = 2 points, penalty goal = 3 points, drop goal = 3 points.

The Black Death), was not confined to Medieval Europe (as many readers would suspect). In fact, the Bubonic plague has existed for thousands of years, the first known case being recorded in China dating back to 224 B.C.E..\nThe most significant outbreak, and most noticeable, occurred in Europe in the mid-fourteenth century over a five year period (1347 to 1352). During this time period, sources indicate that at least 25 million people died, about one-third of the continent’s population (these numbers are disputed). The often disputed claims as to the cause of such a disease was further investigated in 2010 and 2011, when researchers analyzed DNA from some of its European victims. The consensus to date is that the pathogen responsible was the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which most likely caused several different forms of the plague.\nSeeing an outbreak within the borders of Egypt, with so few deaths was incredible, which warrants further understanding of this disease, how it was spread and who it affected. The Gazette’s article (above) mentions that approximately 13 cases were under treatment during the middle of August and beginning of September, 1905. With the plague’s notorious reputation, the Gazette’s allocated space to this pandemic is sapient, especially due to the many cattle deaths in the area within that same time period (the figure to the right indicates the area affected by the Bubonic Plague).\nWith modern populations shifted to cities in modern day, an unidentifiable plague in one of these areas would prove to be even more catastrophic than ever before.\nFor further study: Yersinia Pestis. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951374/\nA Draft genome of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death. https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7370/full/nature10549.html\nPlague in 18th Century Egypt. https://contagions.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/plague-in-18th-century-egypt/\n","date":1478390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478390400,"objectID":"c566046736d66839d663bb22232f97cb","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-06-cyr-bubonic-plague/","publishdate":"2016-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-11-06-cyr-bubonic-plague/","section":"post","summary":"Bubonic Plague Claims Lives in 1905, Not Just a Medieval Problem.","tags":["bubonic Plague","disease"],"title":"Bubonic Plague In Egypt","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hannah Sain"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"During a time when merchandise regulation is not nearly as controlled as it is now, it can be expected that there will be defaults in the products produced.

It was often recommended to people with joint disease, such as rheumatism, to alleviate pain. At first the negative side effects associated with salicylate of soda reported were minor, like a relapse in pain after the salicylate of soda was no longer being used. Many users had to be gradually weaned from the chemical.\nA few years after its use in soap, physicians began noting that people who were repeated salicylate of soda users had painful skin and there was even a case of failing vision after taking a bath in the soap with the chemicals. In the early 1900s, manufacturers of soap products containing the chemical were ordered to stop production and were prosecuted by the sanitary administration. Large soap companies during this time, like Pears’ Soap, were not being advertised because of the ordeal. Instead, the same issue of the newspaper that published the harmful soap announcement had an ad for Sunlight Soap, which advertises its lack of “obnoxious or harmful feature.” This small news brief gives insight about this time period, showing its lack of medical knowledge and its clever marketing methods.\n","date":1478390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478390400,"objectID":"05969fe286481365c395b2f3bc6444b9","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-06-soap/","publishdate":"2016-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-11-06-soap/","section":"post","summary":"Soap producers have been using an extra ingredient in their product that cleans off more than just dirt.

As any programmer knows, performing the same actions over and over again signals a perfect opportunity to use code to script out those actions.\nI spent time this weekend investigating the possibility of using Haskell to write a script to automatically TEI index certain words with tags and reference data.\nThe program (which would be a command-line utility at first) needs to perform a few basic functions:\nAdd tags to text inside any xml nodes Update attributes of tags with specified contents Take in input file that describes a set of commands This would potentially allow me to update every xml file in the entire repository simultaneously, inserting the proper tags for a list of names, dates, and locations. Something like:\nplacename: - (Tokyo, ref, some-link-to-wikidata) - (London, ref, some-link-to-wikidata) - (St. Petersburg, ref, some-link-to-wikidata) - (Port Said, ref, some-link-to-wikidata) persname: - (Lord Cromer, ref, some-link-to-person-data) This would allow me to just keep an up-to-date set of location names, attribute names, and links that I could then very easily update or apply to any issue in the entire year, and perhaps even set it to run every time I changed a file, so I would never have to worry about manually changing this information.\nA quick note on XML XML can be visualized as a “rose tree” made of nodes. This basically means that every part of the XML document is some sort of node, which has other nodes inside of it. The nodes can be any type of tag, or any plain text, and any number of both in any order.\nHere’s what some XML in your issue might look like as a Tree\ndiv -*- dateline -*- date - Text | *- Text | *- placename - Text | *- p - Text *- byline - Text And here it is as XML\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dateline\u0026gt;\u0026lt;date\u0026gt;2nd October 1905\u0026lt;/date\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;placename\u0026gt;Port Said\u0026lt;/placename\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/dateline\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here is some text, detailing an amazing story about something.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;byline\u0026gt;(Reuter.)\u0026lt;/byline\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Functional Programming I program in Haskell mostly. Haskell is a pure functional language, which just means it’s not the same as the traditional programming languages you see day-to-day, and it’s not something FSU teaches currently.\nIt looks something like this:\nand :: Bool -\u0026gt; Bool -\u0026gt; Bool and c t = if c then t else False filter :: (a -\u0026gt; Bool) -\u0026gt; [a] -\u0026gt; [a] filter p xs = [x | x \u0026lt;- xs, p x] map :: (a -\u0026gt; b) -\u0026gt; [a] -\u0026gt; [b] map _ [] = [] map f x:xs = f x : map xs It’s pretty rad, it looks quite unlike most languages I’ve seen in my day. Haskell has some really interesting properties, though. It’s really easy to parse documents as a result, but it’s difficult to transform them easily. Many libraries exist to extract data easily and reliably from xml documents, but few to transform or modify them in a programatic way.\nI did find one eventually: the Haskell XML Toolbox. It lets you do some pretty interesting things. It uses something called arrows (a very trippy functional programming concept), to allow the programmer to compose filters together to navigate the XML tree.\nThe documentation has this example:\nisA :: (a -\u0026gt; Bool) -\u0026gt; (a -\u0026gt; [a]) isA p x | p x = [x] | otherwise = [] It takes a function (called a predicate) that returns a True/False value, and creates a new function that can process, or filter, values. Essentially, these arrows let us process parts of a tree into no results, one result, or many results. By using different types of filters, and by putting these filters together, with some relatively simple structure we can create some extremely complex instructions to parse and transform the document.\nAgain, an example from the documentation:\ngetGrandChildren :: XmlFilter getGrandChildren = getChildren \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; getChildren The (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) operator makes it extremely trivial to chain filters together to make new filters. The ability to compose functions like this is the hallmark of functional programming, and works extremely well in this case.\nBy defining a few more combination operators, the HXT library quickly builds up sufficient capability to tackle some really complicated parsing, as in:\ngetTextChildren2 :: XmlFilter getTextChildren2 = getChildren \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ( isXText \u0026lt;+\u0026gt; ( getChildren \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; isXText ) ) which only gets the text children for of the current tag, and the text of any tags inside the current one.\nUsing this extremely flexible library, I hope to find a practical way to automate much of the task of TEI indexing the Egyptian Gazette!\n","date":1478390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478390400,"objectID":"baf681da6f8c573a55f057cc812c90c6","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-06-haskell-and-xml/","publishdate":"2016-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-11-06-haskell-and-xml/","section":"post","summary":"A Technical Reflection","tags":["Haskell","XML"],"title":"Haskell and XML","type":"post"},{"authors":["Erek Cyr"],"categories":["Technical"],"content":"Attempting to digitize a year of the Egyptian Gazette newspaper proves difficult as students find their individual difficulties in attempting the task.\nThe year to be digitized is 1905, and each student has been given a week to digitize and examine the newspaper’s contents as the task is completed.

The delay in its appearance is, we are told in the text, almost entirely due to the groat quantity of monuments remaining to us from the reign of Rameses II., which apparently made it necessary for Prof. Petrie to go carefully through the list and to throw out such as he considered either appropriations of the works of earlier kings, or for some other reason unworthy of note.\nThe work was delayed specifically because there was so much history, and so many monuments to examine and study!\n","date":1477699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477699200,"objectID":"066153591bd7179b20ef6ea6eb8cf0e4","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-29-egyptology/","publishdate":"2016-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-29-egyptology/","section":"post","summary":"A curiosity","tags":["egyptology","archeology","ramses","excavation"],"title":"Egyptology \u0026 Archeology","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hank Thompson"],"categories":["Technical"],"content":"So my biggest technical difficulty while working on this project has to have been the multiple errors that I encountered while using he OCR.

In general, the more space devoted to an item, the greater its importance, especially if there’s a font change involved. In The Egyptian Gazette, a pattern is well established in formatting the columns in relation to content within those columns. Generally, articles are divided into 6 columns and ads are divided into 3 columns and given a larger font than articles. This either means that the ads are more important to the editors of the paper, deserving of more space; or that the articles simply need to be smaller so that more of them can be included in the paper. However, under the assumption that the second is true, then room for the articles could be made from the comparably luxurious space provided to ads by simply making the ads a bit smaller or more compact. Therefore, the former assumption makes more sense: that the editors give more importance to ads in the paper than content. There are a variety of things that could be the reason for this: money or readers’ preference being of the most obvious. Since ads are the biggest source of income for newspapers, it makes sense to give them priority to ensure companies will want their ads posted in the paper as sort of an investment in the future income of the paper. Concurrently, in a business town such as Alexandria, businesses are of utmost import, with individuals wanting to see of their competitors and resources available.\n","date":1477526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477526400,"objectID":"e6b5c8447076d3342a69572932fedb89","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-27-column-formatting/","publishdate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-27-column-formatting/","section":"post","summary":"An insinuation of importance by size devotion.","tags":["technical","formatting","column","importance"],"title":"Column Formatting","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jacob Stefonek"],"categories":["technical"],"content":"I suppose I’ll start off with how much I’ve learned so far through this course; taking digital images of film, running text recognition software, writing in Markdown and encoding in XML.

This era is often characterized by historians as Pax Britannica, Latin for “British Peace.” It is so called due to the fact that Britain’s worldwide domination in the areas of economics, shipping, and military might kept most of Europe and the world in a state of relative peace. However, as the twentieth century came into view, global forces such as liberal ideals and nationalism threatened Britain’s role as the premier world superpower. Questions of how to proceed with its imperial rule began to multiply both in Britain and in its many colonies and territories abroad.\nOn the third page of the May 3rd, 1905 edition of the Egyptian Gazette contains an editorial article “Lord Cromer’s Sane Imperialism” that discusses a moderate “third way” of imperialism that rejects harsh materialistic concepts and embraces more liberal ideas of self-determination and government, when appropriate of course. This article maintains that Lord Cromer’s Annual Report on Egypt and the Sudan contain the necessary elements of pursuing a moderate approach for continuing the might of the Empire moving forward. This editorial provides a fascinating look at the prevailing dialogue of the day in one of Britain’s most crucial imperial territories about the morality and governance of British imperialism at the dawn of the 20th century.\n","date":1477267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477267200,"objectID":"26a134f6c0f3ffe3516c3f41e2ac8211","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-24-british-imperialism/","publishdate":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-24-british-imperialism/","section":"post","summary":"Moving forward","tags":["Imperialism","Pax Britannica","nationalism"],"title":"British Imperialism","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brandon Barrett"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"As I was going through and correcting the text of the Egyptian Gazette from February of 1905, I noticed that at certain events, the paper gives long lists of names of people who attended.

This sparked my mind, making me think is this community very closely knit to the point where most people would know a majority of the names that are listed? Are the names on these lists just the highly recognized citizens, or is it a mix of everyone in the community? The events that they list names for include, but are not limited to, arrivals, departures, visitors lists, guests at restaurants, dances, and even concerts. As I analyze some of the lists, I look at the names and think that they must be only listing the celebrities, or important well known people of their day. Then as I look at other lists, they seem like just a jumble of names that include everyone, popular or not. These records of who attended events are quite lengthy, which makes me believe that these lists are composed of a mix of everyone in the community, and simply just lists all of the names that either depart or arrive on a ship that week. If this is true, then this community is not as closely knit as I was first lead to believe.

Take for instance the incident they reported on in the November 1st issue in 1905, shown above.\nThe story of a house collapsing and killing seven people would have been a rather large headline in a local paper today, such as when a thrift store collapsed in Philadelphia. But the Egyptian Gazette barely gives any information on it, acting as if it just another everyday occurrence. The coverage is rather sparse by our modern standards, where just about everything that can be sensationalized is, but the most interesting part is when it is compared to other articles within the paper. The paper dedicates an entire section of the paper to simply announce that an aristocratic madam has left Paris, complete with headline, but puts this story in with a group of other local stories and express little interest.\nThis type of reporting just took me off guard at first, especially when is noticed it was not a one-off occurrence. There is a story of a young boy drowning in the Nile, reports of deaths from the Plague and murders all treated with the same aloof attitude. This could possibly be attributed to the simple fact that death was more common 111 years ago. It didn’t effect people in the same way as it does today. Take for instance the death of a six-year old child in Sydney Australia. He has a large separate news story into his death and even has an impending investigation into it. It is possible that the house collapse also has an investigation going on as well, but the newspaper does not mention anything of the sort.\nThe stark contrast in reporting between the Egyptian Gazette and our modern day newspapers just struck me as an interesting story to blog about, and so I did. Hopefully the reason I presented for this difference can be confirmed or denied later on, but only further research will tell.\n","date":1477267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477267200,"objectID":"fa8c68a9935f95aa9120b20e04a7069e","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-24-building-collapse-hank-thompson/","publishdate":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-24-building-collapse-hank-thompson/","section":"post","summary":"A Curiosity.","tags":["construction","death","investigation"],"title":"Fatal House Collapse","type":"post"},{"authors":["John White"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"My chosen blog post is on the excerpt from May 29’s page 4, titled ‘In Praise of England: American Women’s Preference for Our Country’. It regards a conversation between noted British feminist and philanthropist, Lady Henry Somerset, and an unnamed, anonymous American female expatriate in London.\nApparently, most women that expatriate had spoken to preferred England over their home country (with the exception of one). The reasons the expatriate gave were the comparative independence and equality women receive in England as opposed to back home in America. Women may be praised more back across the pond, she said, but women in England are treated more as equals, ‘occupying a plane of frank comradeship’.\nSpeaking as someone reading this section a century and eleven years after its publication, this initially seemed to be just a sop to contemporary British nationalism. It looked like it was just a way for English businessman, sitting in comfortable chairs in opulent lobbies, being waited on by Egyptian servants, to have a good chortle over the inferiority of those other, lesser, nations.\nBut then I looked up Lady Henry Somerset, mostly just to see if she was anyone important. And she was. She has her own Wikipedia article and anything. Lady Henry was originally Lady Isabella Somers-Cooks, until she married Lord Henry Somerset in 1872. They had a relatively happy marriage, at least seemingly, but it turned out that Lord Henry was gay. And he was going behind Lady Henry’s back to sleep with other men. So she sued him for divorce and custody over her son, shoving Lord Henry out of the closet.\nI’m of two minds about this, but I’m leaning towards Lord Henry in this the argument. Lord Henry was forced into a marriage with a person he was fundamentally not attracted to, and so he sought out the company of those he was. Lady Henry shouldn’t have had to suffer the pains of adultery, but Lord Henry shouldn’t have had his sexual orientation forced into public life, especially in a primitive nation like contemporary England.\nAfter her marriage fell apart, Lady Henry became (in)famous for being one of the first women in British society to make the reasons behind a separation known publicly. She then became involved in numerous feminist organizations, and was once voted, by the London Evening News, the women readers would most prefer as their Prime Minister.\nNow that I know of Lady Henry’s life and accomplishments, my opinion on this section has barely changed from ‘sop to British nationalism’ to ‘sop to British nationalism plus the biased opinion of a nationalistic ideologue’. The tale of Lady Henry is an interesting one, and this section of the Egyptian Gazette is just one facet of her long and storied life.\n","date":1477267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477267200,"objectID":"b2705a54b65c2de01256667003a212c1","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-24-somerset/","publishdate":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-24-somerset/","section":"post","summary":"An interesting person","tags":["homophobia","feminism","nationalism"],"title":"Somerset","type":"post"},{"authors":["Logan Wills"],"categories":null,"content":"This week of the Egyptian Gazette contained a consistent current event throughout the duration of the week regarding the blowing up of an old naval vessel, The Chatham.

The amount of dynamite that had been acquired to destroy the wreckage was on pace to set a world record for the largest explosion of dynamite to date, weighing nearly ninety two tons. Of course, along with this massive amount of explosives came the necessity to put to plan a series of precautions and emergency aids in case anything went wrong. The explosives were to be carried to the scene of the wreckage by train, and detonated through a length of copper wire hooked up to a detonator.\nThe townspeople at this time were extremely anxious for the explosion out of fear that some of their personal property may accidentally be destroyed. However, as the week continues on and the anticipation comes to rise, the people near the explosion were shockingly disappointed in the effect of it. Having built up a drastic image in their mind, the world record shattering explosion was fairly disappointing to the people, as they hardly even felt the shock being nineteen kilometers away from the site. The underwater explosion destroyed a decent amount of the naval vessel, while shooting tons of sand, water, and other debris hundreds of feet in the air. While the explosion was considered a success, there was a slight repair process and one of the banks of the canal had been fairly destroyed, and a number of railway lines needed repair.

That alone sounds like something from a movie, but things only get crazier. Alarmed by her husband’s disappearance, his wife goes after him. She too enters the pit and does not return. Now the children are concerned about where their parents have wandered off to. So, the son and daughter go to search for them, enter, and do not return. Finally, a lone village native goes to check it out and becomes asphyxiated as soon as he reaches the old door.\nQuite a few questions came to me as I read this. The first one being, “is this real?” I am still questioning this, simply because it sounds so outrageous. My second question, of course, was the question of what was behind that old door. No one from this story successfully enters far enough to see what lies within, and the story focuses on their tragic deaths rather than addressing a possible discovery. But, did anyone ever enter? I can’t imagine this mysterious discovery would have been forgotten or overlooked, but maybe it was. This lead to the question of whether scenarios such as this one were common for this time period.

This article, in the December 26th issue of the Egyptian Gazette, mentioned both sides of the imperialism conflict, saying the author “devotes a whole chapter to the ‘false position of Great Britain in Egypt.’” The Egyptian Gazette also seems to be an influential avenue for charity donations, frequently reporting on giving to certain causes and being used as a means for donations.\nThe paper devotes an even greater amount of room to a cluster of articles surrounding the death of a khedivial princess. These articles discuss the death of this princess, who was the sister of Prince Omar Pasha and Prince Djemil Pasha Toussoun, as well as the wife of General Ahmed Djelaleddin Pasha. Her husband wishes to open an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her death, documented in a French telegram that is also printed in the Egyptian Gazette. Throughout the collection of articles, the princess is never referred to by name, only as the Khedivial Princess.\nWhether this great amount of detail is due to the shock value of the event or the genuine interest in the matter by English businessmen is open to interpretation.

The pages, most of which were rife with errors, took around 2 and a half hours each to fully type and XML, and even then many advertisements and charts are still not completed.\nAfter I had completed the vast majority of the transcription, I learned that by scanning in a higher resolution and stitching multiple images together, I probably could have produced the paper and a much faster rate.\nNevertheless, I’m continuing to work on completing certain advertisements and charts, as well as TEI-tagging people and places.\n","date":1475712000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475712000,"objectID":"fe0fe608532841b748b3b192a248017b","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-06-technical-difficulties-in-ocr/","publishdate":"2016-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-10-06-technical-difficulties-in-ocr/","section":"post","summary":"A brief summary of the struggles in encoding I've encountered.","tags":["XML","OCR","encoding"],"title":"Technical Difficulties in the Egyptian Gazette","type":"post"},{"authors":["Will Hanley"],"categories":["curiosities"],"content":"Muhammad ‘Abduh died on July 11, 1905.

Each name is a prince of a certain region, nation, type, or character. Billy Ocean might be gratified to see that there is a massive Carib Prince (8,000 tons) and a somewhat slighter African Prince (3,050 tons). No European Prince, but lots of Princes from various parts of Europe:\nI was struck by the coverage of names. The geography of colonial shipping interests dictated part but not all of this range–though the heaviest ships seemed to follow the empire’s shipping lanes. British whimsy seemed to supply other names–Highlands Prince, Soldier Prince, Merchant Prince, and so on. And of course there’s an Ocean Prince: Billy honored before his time.\n","date":1475020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567029430,"objectID":"4774ed33e4b06afbf274142f15f84245","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/will-billy-ocean/","publishdate":"2016-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/will-billy-ocean/","section":"post","summary":"On

Seguin"],"categories":["analysis"],"content":"INTRODUCTION For my analysis project, I focused on the minimum temperatures of Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria and how they differed from May 1906 to April 1907. The goal was to see if there were any significant differences between the minimum temperatures and if so, what caused these variations. I chose these three cities for a number of reasons. I am using Alexandria as the base measure because the “Egyptian Gazette”, the newspaper from which I collected the data, is based in Alexandria. I then tried to chose stations that had minimum temperatures recorded as often as possible. Some of the minimum temperatures in the “Other Stations” table of the “Daily Weather Report” were not recorded as often as Port Said and Suez. By picking these two locations, I am able to have a continuous line graph with enough data points to create a decent line graph.\nPROCEDURE Each of the three cities that I chose to collect data from are located all across the border of Egypt. Alexandria, the main focus of the “Egyptian Gazette”, is located on the northern border and is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, which allows for sea travel. Alexandria is one of the most northern cities out of the three and thus further from the equator. This allows for less intense summers and cooler winters. The second city, Port Said, is also up north, but is closer to Israel and Jorden. It is also right up on the Mediterranean Sea and is a great location for shipping docks. Because it is the other more northern city of the three, it is located further from the equator and may experience different minimum temperatures than the third city. Suez is the third and final city that I chose to collect data. It is alongside the Suez Canal, hence the name, and is more south than the previous two cities. I choose three cities that varied in location because I wanted to see if there were any trends when it came to the minimum temperatures of each area.\nThe “Daily Weather Report” appeared in almost every issue of the “Egyptian Gazette” and was an important section of the newspaper. It provided readers with a handful of valuable information regarding the weather for the specific day. It was important especially during this period because it was one of the only ways to quickly find out the temperature for the day. The “Daily Weather Report” also listed out other bits of information about the weather like the sun rise and set times, the humidity level, the force of the anemometer, and the heat of the sun. These were all valuable information for readers to have.\nThe data that I gathered came from the “Daily Weather Report”. The data for the Alexandria temperatures came from the “min. temp in the shade” row, while the minimum temperatures for Port Said and Suez came from the “Other Stations” table and the “min temp in the shade” column. When it came to getting data points for the minimum temperatures in Alexandria, I used the XPath query: “//table//cell[contains(.,‘Min. Temp in the shade’)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()”. I used the “Daily Weather Report” to the best of my ability; I accumulated the minimum temperatures of the three specific locations, put them into an excel spreadsheet, imported them to Tableau, and created three continuous line graphs that show the varying temperatures from May 1906 to April 1907.\nANALYSIS The point of my analysis project was to determine if there were any major differences between Alexandria and two of the lesser known locations, Port Said and Suez in their minimum temperatures due to the various locations of these three cities. In order to do this, I gathered the minimum temperatures from Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria from the dates of May 1906 to April 1907. This span of a year allowed for a good amount of data points that would show the fluctuations in minimum temperatures in Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria.\nIt is important to note that some of the minimum temperatures may be incorrect. Human error is to blame; some people would forget to update the “Daily Weather Report” with the correct minimum temperatures. On the other side of the spectrum, sometimes the “Daily Weather Report” could not be located in the “Egyptian Gazette”, or the “Other Stations” table was absent. To compensate for these issues, I removed any null data points from each visualization to try and create a better flowing line graph. Another issue that is important to note is the reliability of the data. As time progresses, the technology advances and gets better and more accurate. The minimum temperatures that I collected may not be 100% the actual minimum temperature of the area, but it is still important to look at the data and learn from it.\nBy analyzing by data, I came across some similarities and differences between the three cities in Egypt. For instance, all three of the locations experienced a spike in temperatures on June 15th, 1906. While this date may not be of any importance besides the fact that all three stations shared higher …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eaee6dc44136d06172dc6cf114028a76","permalink":"https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-seguin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/19-analysis-seguin/","section":"post","summary":"INTRODUCTION For my analysis project, I focused on the minimum temperatures of Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria and how they differed from May 1906 to April 1907.
