I find this interesting because when an outbreak of anything happens today, the CDC for example, might send out a similar statement. What also interests me is the difference between the two organizations that would issue such a statement. In Alexandria, the sanitation department seemed to have authority over the control and prevention of disease spreading. This goes on to suggest that early 20th century disease control was thought to be based entirely on sanitation. In the United States, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/mission.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Disease Control&lt;/a> (CDC) has authority over the research and prevention of infectious diseases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article says that its primary goal was to inform the readers of the preparations they can take to guard their own safe being. The following is what the article says the Sanitary Department Suggests:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wash our hands after every visit to &amp;ldquo;lieux d&amp;rsquo;aisance&amp;rdquo; and each time before eating.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat only well-cooked food; avoid altogether unfiltered water, uncooked milk and butter vegetables and fruits which can be neither cooked nor peeled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid all excess of food, generally, and too cold drinks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call in the doctor immediately on the slighted suspicion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watch your servants; do not allow them to go out without changing their clothes and washing their hands on returning; do not allow the boabs to have any persons not belonging to the building with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These precautions are interesting because a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/preventionsteps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggestions&lt;/a> are commonplace today. The second portion of the article describes the actions that the sanitary department will do to inspect the town of infectious diseases. They will inspect establishments and tell them to disinfect with carbonate lime. This will also result in a number of wells being closing down throughout the city.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the article, it is mentioned that a &amp;ldquo;Coastguard cruiser&amp;rdquo; is patrolling the waters of the Red Sea, to prevent pilgrims crossing into Egypt. This article was published towards the end of the Islamic Pilgrimage to Mecca. Also in this time period are many reports from Mecca of reports of Cholera. History also has also seen throughout the 19th century that &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/article/hajj-and-europe/page/0/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cholera&lt;/a> has spread from Mecca during Hajj. Therefore the coastguard trying to keep the pilgrims from entering Egypt might be a good way to keep Alexandria safe from the threat of cholera.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clean Killer</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-06-soap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-06-soap/</guid><description>&lt;p>During a time when merchandise regulation is not nearly as controlled as it is now, it can be expected that there will be defaults in the products produced. [Salicylate of soda](&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2220712/?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2220712/?page=1&lt;/a> Define Salicylate of Soda&amp;quot;) was thought to have restorative effects during the mid to late 19th century. It was often recommended to people with joint disease, such as rheumatism, to alleviate pain. At first the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322509/?page=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative side effects&lt;/a> associated with salicylate of soda reported were minor, like a relapse in pain after the salicylate of soda was no longer being used. Many users had to be gradually weaned from the chemical.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few years after its use in soap, physicians began noting that people who were repeated salicylate of soda users had painful skin and there was even a case of failing vision after taking a bath in the soap with the chemicals. In the early 1900s, manufacturers of soap products containing the chemical were ordered to stop production and were prosecuted by the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5a-Uc3NJuPUC&amp;amp;pg=PA206&amp;amp;lpg=PA206&amp;amp;dq=1905&amp;#43;egyptian&amp;#43;sanitary&amp;#43;administration&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=pGXkko-vu3&amp;amp;sig=P6WCUO4P1BmN_u7Zm8Ny2nSY3Dc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi60p_rs4zQAhWSZiYKHXwdDTMQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=1905%20egyptian%20sanitary%20administration&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanitary administration&lt;/a>. Large soap companies during this time, like Pears’ Soap, were not being advertised because of the ordeal. Instead, the same issue of the newspaper that published the harmful soap announcement had an ad for Sunlight Soap, which advertises its lack of “obnoxious or harmful feature.” This small news brief gives insight about this time period, showing its lack of medical knowledge and its clever marketing methods.&lt;/p>
