&lt;p>Egypt is home to many different religions, however, I only plan to talk about the main religious groups in Egypt as well as one smaller group as a comparison. The two largest religious groups of Egypt are the Muslim community and the Christian community, with the Muslim community in particular making up the majority of the religious influence in the country. The smaller religious group I am talking about is Judaism, while Judaism is a very large religion internationally in the country of Egypt it is and has been dying out. To give accurate numbers, as stated in &lt;a href="https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/egyptian-culture/egyptian-culture-religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cultural Atlas&lt;/a> “The vast majority of the Egyptian population (90%) identify as Muslim, mostly of the Sunni denomination. Of the remaining population, 9% identify as Coptic Orthodox Christian and the remaining 1% identify with some other denomination of Christianity.”&lt;/p>

Paragraphs in each issue that mention “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan”
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The graph that appears above can be complicated to understand, so I figured that I should break it down and make it more understandable for most viewers. This graph is a visualization of how often the words “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan” are mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I chose these words as they are the most common ways to refer to the people of these religions in Egypt and so are best suited for finding this information in the Egyptian Gazette. The information is separated into months throughout the years 1904-1907, the red line is the word “Jew”, the blue line is “Christian”, and the green line is “mohammedan”.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="judaism">Judaism&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Jewish people as a whole are a very small part of the Egyptian population with there only being three Jews in the entirety of egypt as of right now. Why, then, does the graph above show that the word “Jew” is mentioned often in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the answer to this is that the Egyptian Gazette was not based around talking about the local groups but more the world and the news involved as whole, this would make far more sense as the news about Judaism in the world would coincide with the high number of mentions of the word “Jew”. As I researched some important events that occurred in Judaism over the years of 1904-1907 I came across a large event that must have caused the News to talk about it for many years. This was the Russian Revolution of 1905, which was a revolution that had an incredibly large amount of Jewish people in it, due to the horrible discrimination being put upon them by the Russian government. As stated in &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4205328#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The role of the Jews in the Russian Revolutionary Movement&lt;/a> “While the Jews formed only seven million out of a total population of 136 million, about fifty percent of the membership of the Revolutionary parties was Jewish”. This event had long and big impacts on Judaism as a whole and would have most definitely provided a big spike in Jewish news throughout the world. This is, in my opinion, a strong reason for the large amount of time that the word “Jew” is mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I must also mention that while the word “Jew” was mentioned many times in the Gazette there is also a possibility that the word “Jew” could be a part of something else such as the name of a place or part of the word Jewel, however I believe that the vast majority of these mentions were based in talking about Judaism instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="christianity">Christianity&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Christianity as whole is one of the largest religions in the entire world boasting around 2.2 billion followers around the world. This humongous religion is also a large part of Egypts religious groups making up around 9% of the people in Egypt. However, as we have learned with Judaism and the word “Jew” being a large part of Egypt does not seem to be a big factor in if a religion is mentioned more or not in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the large amounts of mentions of the word “Christian” in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette is due to simply how big and notable of a religion Christianity is as a whole. Due to Christianities size there is always news and things going on that involve the word “Christian” hence the large amount of hits. The Egyptian Gazette is able to report on the news inside the country involving Christians as well as the many other important things going on with the religion outside of it. One notable Christian event that could coincide with the high number of times the word “Christian” appears could be the Indian Pentecost occurring in India in 1905. As talked about in &lt;a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/2008/august/indian-pentecost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Pentecost&lt;/a> the Indian Pentecost was a large religious movement in India where Christianity had a sudden and strong revival in the country due to various missionaries spreading their message. This had little to no effect on India however it most definitely made the news and caused a large influx in the amount of time the word “Christian” appeared in the Egyptian Gazette. This and many more events involving Christianity are constantly occurring around the world so to see such a high amount of times that Christianitty is mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette comes as little surprise to me. There is also the fact that sometimes the word “Christian” doesn’t always mean Christianity as it could be a name or a place. I do believe however, that the majority of the times that the word “Christian” appears is based around Christianity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="islam">Islam&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Islam is the absolute biggest religion in the country of Egypt with is spanning a humongous number of ninety percent of the population as a whole. Why, then, you might as it is mentioned so little in the Egyptian Gazette as opposed to less notable religions in Egypt such as Judaism. I believe there are a couple of answers to this question, one of the most notable in my opinion is that the Egyptian Gazette focused more on outside news when it comes to religion as opposed to inside news so the mentions of Islam become smaller as opposed to Christianity and Judaism. Another and the most likely is that because the Gazette talked about outside news they don’t use the word “Mohammedan” as often as they would if it was about religion inside the country. This is due to the fact that while Mohammedan is a common word to refer to the Islamic people in Egypt, it is less common throughout the world. Therefore, the mentions of the word “Mohammedan” in the Egyptian Gazette focus more on the local and national news as opposed to the more widespread international news that the Gazette prefers to talk about when it comes to religion. After researching various sources I have also learned that Islam also was not a very active religion in the time period set with the Egyptian Gazette. The only thing of note was that the Ottoman empire was falling which was having some effect on Judaism but was also just bigger news that would subvert news about Judaism. This lack of Islamic news could also play a part in why the word “Mohammedan” is mentioned so little in the Egyptian Gazette.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comparison-and-final-thoughts">Comparison and Final thoughts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These three religions have provided me with many different conclusions and new information that I would never have known or thought of before. I have learned of the Egyptian Gazettes preference for international news, as well as how the local population of that religion does not affect the Egyptian Gazette very much in how often they talk about a certain religion. Christianity and Judaism are mentioned far more often that Islam both because thy had more newsworthy things occur in this time period but also because the word “Mohammedan” is less used in international news. I also have another theory as to why Judaims and Christianity are mentioned so often in the Egyptian Gazette. My theory is that due to the close ties religiously between Judaism and Christianity they are more often mentioned together or in comparison to each other than what would occur with Islam. Thus would lead to more results when it comes to the words “Jew” and “Christian” as they could be mentioned in a story about the other religion. Even so, without all of these theories it is a fact that in the Egyptian Gazette, in a total expectation subversion for me, the word “Jew” appears the most out of these three words, “Christian” the second most, and “Mohammedan” the least. This is completely different from what I was expecting when I started this project and has allowed me to research more in depth and learn more things about why a newspaper like the Egyptian Gazette would talk more about each religion and how this came to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pe-Ru-Na the 1900 drug scam</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-12-05-obos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-12-05-obos/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>While browsing the Egyptian Gazette of December 3rd, 1904 I came across an interesting ad talking about an ex-Consul General of Australia and how he was promoting a new drug called “Pe-Ru-Na”. I took interest in this ad and proceeded to research this drug and its creator and came across many interesting facts about this apparent “wonder-drug”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently it was branded as being able to cure Catarrh, which &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/catarrh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHS Inform&lt;/a> tells us is a buildup of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body. A previous post (&lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-03-06-baxter-peruna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Miraculous Medicine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>) talks about another ad featuring a women suffereing from Catarrh for three years until Peruna cured it. We now know that this is a harmless condition that will eventually go away and is easily treated through things like saline nasal rinse, avoiding allergens, and staying well hydrated. However, these treatments were far less known back in the time of “Pe-Ru-Na” and so this “drug” was able to gain customers. As found in the &lt;a href="https://aadl.org/node/508575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann Arbor District Library,&lt;/a> all you needed to do was take a tablespoon of “Pe-Ru-Na” before each meal and when you go to sleep and Catarrh will go away perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I researched more into this “drug” I confirmed what I had begun to suspect, that “Pe-Ru-Na” was a scam and can be easily made by almost anyone. As stated in &lt;a href="https://www.peachridgeglass.com/2018/10/pe-ru-na-for-catarrh-the-great-american-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Pe-Ru-Na for Catarrh- The Great American Fraud,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;Any one wishing to make Peruna for home consumption may do so by mixing half a pint of cologne spirits, 190 proof, with a pint and a half of water, adding thereto a little cubebs for flavor and a little burned sugar for color.” In summary, “Pe-Ru-Na” was a drug scam that was run back in the early 1900’s that ended up just being common alcohol with a little extra mixed in. This scam became incredibly popular because of all of the ads about people proclaiming that Peruna &amp;ldquo;saved their lives&amp;rdquo;, as can be seen in &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-majonica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Advertising, Has anything Really Changed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the drug being a scam, it was far more welcomed in the United States. The US was in the middle of Prohibition, and Peruna could still be sold over the counter. As mentioned in &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-14-bolton-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fellow blog post about Pe-Ru-Na&lt;/a> Peruna became so popular that people named their children after it, with the Southern Methodist University naming their school mascot Peruna. All together though I believe this to be a funny example of past scams that can be looked upon in retrospect while laughing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How can microhistorical digital research methods apply to questions concerning qualitative data</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-qualitative-group/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-qualitative-group/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our group is filled with many different questions with very few similarities between them all, however, after looking through what we were each using as a question and how we were researching we came to the conclusion that our group would best be summarized as one based around qualitative research. The question we decided to base our research on is how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression. The way to answer this question took us a long time to figure out due to how large of a question this is, we ended up having to collaborate and brainstorm many different ideas before coming up with a simple and effective solution. The solution we came up with to achieve this task was to create a general Xpath query that we could use in each of our individual projects and compare and contrast the data and information we got with this query. We all created visualizations based off of this Xpath query to make this goal more achievable. The question itself and the methodology used to solve were very useful for each of our individual projects, especially as many of our personal questions are complicated and difficult to answer. With this group project question we can work on our own projects as a side effect of the group project question we are answering. In summary, we are a qualitative data group who are trying to answer how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-a-query">Finding a Query&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As our group had many different topics, finding a common query seemed like a rather daunting task. Tying religion to military ranks to mummies, etc. looked to be somewhat impossible, especially considering how each individual project was specific in its own unique way. Thus, our query ended up being broad to fit the various objectives we had, which ended up being tied to our research methods (qualitative research). The query ended up being how many times a certain word that related to our project showed up across the entire Egyptian Gazette digital catalog, in any feature. We had mentions of the words: “Commander”, “Turks”, “Migration”, “Yours truly”, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The expression we ended up using was //div[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]/@feature, with “x” being the word we searched for. We put this into the XPath 2.0 search bar in the Oxygen Editor and queried the contents of the whole newspaper with our individual terms. Once the whole contents were queried, we copied over the results into a plain text editor, where we would edit it to be usable in an Excel spreadsheet. From there, we would copy it into Tableau, the application that visualizes the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the query worked shows how similar our data collection methods are. While the query itself is incredibly broad, it is a good representation of what we will do in our individual analysis projects. Specific searches would not work; thus, this method is likely the lowest common denominator that we have as a group.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-visualizations">Creating Visualizations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With our XPath query, we were searching for a few simple results in common for otherwise uncommon topics of study. Our query yielded the feature, date, and page number of every division that contained a keyword of our respective independent research efforts. With this data we sought to generate a set of visualizations that used the same type of data in roughly the same style and theme, to be easily compared to one another for possible similarities and discrepancies in the patterns of each, which could indicate a connection between the different topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We chose to use the date, feature count, page number, and feature for our visualizations. We formatted them in roughly the same manner, with a basic scatterplot styling. We placed the date variable along the x-axis and plotted the page number variable along the y-axis. The feature count data points are placed at each of their respective dates and page numbers, and then color coded each data point with its corresponding feature name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method of visualization provides for a simplistic, understandable representation of our data. The matching formats and color coding allow for an easy way to compare our seemingly unrelated data just from glancing at each of the charts. Weaknesses of this visualization are that you cannot gather much just from these charts, only use them to infer about events that may have caused them to have patterns that coincide at the same time, leading to further investigation and research. While that is a glaring weakness, there is not much else to start out from researching, as the topics in question do not have much in common, so we must find similarities and differences before any reasoning can be found.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comparing-and-contrasting-our-visualizations">Comparing and Contrasting Our Visualizations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once we completed our visualizations, we could embark on the analysis of our results. Since we each had such vast individual research topics, we were interested in comparing variables like page number, amount of data, the features that appeared most often, and the overall function our data would serve. Some proved to be more feasible than others:&lt;/p>

As we completed our individual research, we realized that there is more variance than we originally expected. While our visualizations are fundamentally the same, they each present data differently. Since we all align under the scope of qualitative research, we expected most results to appear on page three of The Egyptian Gazette. However, our visualizations show that research relating to individuals (for example: &amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Migration&amp;rdquo;) appears to spread across more pages than visualizations based on specific topics (for example: &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mummy&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>

While comparing the visualizations, we also looked at the features where our data most appeared. It is difficult to identify exact results since the paper includes incomplete sections that do not have feature titles. This allows for easier navigation but does not show a complete picture. The features vary depending on the intentions of the research. The &amp;ldquo;yours truly&amp;rdquo; query appeared most in the Letters feature since it was specific to the Letter to the Editor section of the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em>. We ran the Xpath query to limit the search results to useful data rather than to identify the most common feature. This allowed for better quantitative data use during the research process. Contrastly, qualitative research attempts to discover which features discussed the topic. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Mummy&amp;rdquo; Xpath query revealed the most used features were Local and Egyptological. This led to more research questions and was used to understand the importance of mummies to the readers of the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

It was alluring to see when specific results spiked and dipped in results. However, when we attempted to draw links between rises and falls between visualizations, the results were inconclusive. In the Fall of 2006, the &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; visualization displayed an uptick in results. We attempted to research the reason and compare it to the uptick of results for the &amp;ldquo;Turks&amp;rdquo; visualization: to no avail. Since the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em> files are incomplete, it is challenging to know if the spike is due to complete access to data or the paper&amp;rsquo;s coverage of the topic at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overall-strengths--weaknesses-in-microhistorical-qualitative-research">Overall Strengths &amp;amp; Weaknesses In Microhistorical Qualitative Research&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the digital research methods we used with the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em> as our microhistorical source were complex and nuanced per each person&amp;rsquo;s research question; due to these complexities and nuances, various strengths and weaknesses arose during the employment of our chosen methods. A chief strength of our chosen XPath query and visualization format was their ability to encapsulate the significance of our search terms. The sheer quantity of results that our queries yielded provided us with adequate perceptions of how significant our chosen research topics were within the &lt;em>Gazette&lt;/em>, which is a useful starting point for the research process. Our chosen query and visualization also demonstrate the distribution of our search terms over multiple years of &lt;em>Gazette&lt;/em> issues. The ability to ascertain any trends in the mentions of our search terms, such as if the term has a higher proportional frequency in certain months, is vital for the qualitative research we each embarked on. Our understanding of potential trends allowed for further research and analysis since we could consult secondary sources or more XPath query results to help explain these trends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some weaknesses arose, though, from the confining nature of our chosen XPath query. Our query limited our results to only yield from &lt;em>Gazette&lt;/em> items labeled as features. Although this provided each of us with a smaller, much more manageable amount of data than a raw word count, it significantly limited the amount and types of trends we could analyze. Also, a weakness arises from the rather rudimental level of our chosen visualizations. Although these visualizations provided sufficient starting points for the research process, they did not yield enough data alone to be able to approach each of our complex qualitative research questions. This weakness, though, is merely reflective of the holistic qualitative research process. Qualitative research&amp;rsquo;s reliance on data beyond easily quantifiable characteristics meant we had to get creative to come up with numerical data for each of our projects. Many of us had to try multiple search terms that were relevant to our research topics before we even acquired enough data to transfer to a visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, we feel that our chosen XPath query and visualization format effectively initiated our research processes and created a compelling concept to discuss as a group. The query and visualization format may not have been enough to answer our research questions by themselves, but they were helpful when accompanied by further research. We recommend utilizing similar digital methods to other qualitative researchers; however, we suggest limiting the XPath queries to multiple types of items within the &lt;em>Gazette&lt;/em> rather than just features to see if another query yields a more desirable amount of results. Overall, these digital methods are imperfect, but in their imperfections, they reflect the unique limits and challenges of microhistorical research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Digital Microhistory as a whole serves as an experimentational launching board between the realms of quantitative and qualitative analysis, and by nature our project was able to develop into an apt reflection of that reality. Within our project’s inquiry, we were faced with challenges beyond the scope of the dichotomy of using computational methodology to encompass qualitative data, specifically in that each specific personal topic was vastly different from the other. In the pursuit of trying to understand how to bridge these gaps, we developed a slightly broadened X-Path query, //div[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]/@feature, in order to encompass a similar objective within a common research method. It was through this we came to realize that within the confines of qualitative data, a good launching pad is looking at numerical counts of usage of “trigger words” along with location of said usage, and moreover supplies a unifying factor between distinct topics of qualitative research. In looking to display our data we opted for a scatterplot styling as it most aptly reflected the particular factors returned from our query: feature, date, feature count, and page number of every division that contained a keyword of our respective research efforts. This visualization was an easily understandable representation of our findings, and allowed for effectiveness in comparing various results across the independent research efforts. These differences highlighted certain vantage and null points for each individual project, and supplemented our notions as to where to continue looking for more specific information on our individual topics. In reflection, we realized that the query was able to encapsulate the significance of key terms while also serving as a helpful catalyst into more specialized research; however, while supplying us with a more workable set of data it limits the amount/type of trends we could analyze, and so you would need more queries in order to substantially supplement one’s research. Overall, the most profound lesson learned was the amount of work and research that could still be done in regards to computational research methods concerning qualitative data, and that it is necessary to go through multiple rounds of trial and error and experimentation in order to find more defined yet transferable methods of querying for qualitative data. Furthermore, it may be concluded that in the vast diversity within qualitative data that a “one-size-fits-all query” simply can not be overarchingly specific and yield consistent, detailed, and specialized results for each pursued topic. Ultimately, this project reflected the intricacies encompassed in the microhistorical digital research methodology in order to relate the surface level disconnect between qualitative information and computational analysis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
