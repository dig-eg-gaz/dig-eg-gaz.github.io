      <description>&lt;p&gt;Egypt in the early 20th century was a unique hub of cosmopolitan gathering. It was a central location for travelers, migrants, colonialists, and natives, and despite the many different backgrounds and origins of the people who populated Egypt, one trait remained constant: a desire to be entertained. Entertainment was found in Egypt in a variety of denominations, including theater, steamboat trips, and sporting events. Sporting events in particular had significant cultural influence in Egypt, serving as entertainment for the local populations as well as a shared interest among both local and colonialist inhabitants. The mention of sports throughout the Egyptian Gazette reflects the interests of the newspaper’s readers as well as providing insight into the ever-changing daily lives of the residents of Egypt. Perhaps more importantly, they present patterns through longevity that reflect how sports as a means of entertainment interact with other outlets of life in early 20th century Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to draw any conclusions about sports in the Egyptian Gazette, a comprehensive metric for identifying where sports are mentioned first had to be established. After many readings of Egyptian Gazette articles, as well as external research, it became apparent that the most common sports being played and documented in the newspaper at the time were aquatic sports, horseback riding, football (soccer), and cricket. In order to find instances of these in the existing Digital Egyptian Gazette database, a simple X-Path Query was constructed, starting by searching for football. More specifically, using the “matches” feature when searching for a div within a div. The query appears as follows: “//div//div[matches(., &amp;lsquo;football&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]”. This returned all of the instances of the word “football” within the Egyptian Gazette. A similar approach was taken for the remaining sports, with the queries for “aqua sports” and “horseback riding” simply using two “matches” statements to ensure the most comprehensive results were returned. Hence, the horseback riding query appeared as: &lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(., &#39;horse&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][matches(., &#39;riding&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; and the aqua sports query appeared as &lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(., &#39;aqua&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][matches(., &#39;sports’, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;. It is important to note that neither the words “aquatic” nor “horseback” were included in full. Rather, “horse” and “aqua” are used in the queries as a more inclusive search term that is likely to return more results. The final query utilized was for cricket, arguably the most popular sport of the time. In this query, however, the type “wire” was excluded to void all mentions of cricket games occurring in England that were telegraphed to Egypt and written about in the newspaper. Therefore, the query for mentions of cricket in the Egyptian Gazette appeared like this: &lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(., &#39;cricket&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][not(@type=&amp;quot;wire&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;. The term “wire” does not need to be excluded from other queries, as cricket had disproportionately more mentions in telegraphs relative to other sports, which had practically none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving the total number of instances in which these four different sports were mentioned throughout the Egyptian Gazette database, it was almost time to visualize the results. However, the goal of this study was to draw a more longitudinal analysis of sports over time. The best way to do this was to count the total monthly mentions of each sport, regardless of the quantity of times it is mentioned in one issue or the year that the issue was published. This metric would provide a dataset that shows the monthly popularity of each sport, as sports are known for being both seasonal occurrences that result in fluctuating popularity. So, using a simple C++ algorithm written in Visual Studio Code, the number of “repeat mentions” for any sport was subtracted from the total monthly sums of mentions of that same sport, void of year. Algorithmically, it appeared like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;j=(totalIssueMentions[i]-1)&lt;/code&gt; //calculates 1 less than the total number of times a sport is mentioned in 1 issue and sets it equal to variable j&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;issueMention[i]=(totalIssueMentions[i]-j)&lt;/code&gt; //subtracts variable j from the total number of times that sport is mentioned in that same issue, which will always equal 1. &lt;em&gt;This effectively counts the issues rather than the mentions&lt;/em&gt;. This value is then set to issueMention variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;totalMontlyMentions[k]=∑issueMention[i]&lt;/code&gt; //calculates the summation of the total number of issues that mention the same sport in the same month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of a dynamic 2-dimensional array made it so every issue regardless of year was included in the calculations, each issue was only calculated once, and each sport was counted independently of the other three sports for each month. The array value of [i] is a counter that starts at 0 and runs to ∞ and increases for every new issue. The array value [k] is a counter that starts at 0 and runs to 12 and increases for every new month. The result is a total of the monthly counts of issues of the Egyptian Gazette that mentions that particular sport. On a graph, it is visualized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visualization contains many other variables in addition to the monthly total number of issues that help identify patterns related to interest in sports in early 20th century Egypt. First, is average monthly temperature. It is evident that in winter months where the average monthly temperature is between 0 and 16 degrees Celsius that sports recordings in the Egyptian Gazette are at their lowest. This is likely due to less sports being played or watched due to the uncomfortable outside temperatures. On the other hand, fall and spring months where the temperature averaged between 16 and 25 degrees Celsius saw relatively higher counts of sports mentions in the Gazette. However, sports interacted with each other just as responsively as they did with monthly temperatures. Namely, the summer spike in attention to cricket took away from the journalism directed at other sports. The months of June-August display all-time highs for cricket, and all time lows for all other sports, suggesting that cricket journalism crowded out attention towards other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, sports in the Egyptian Gazette were an outlet of entertainment and cultural diffusion. They were extremely important to the daily lives of both Egyptian residents and passer-bys, and the information displayed here identifies several significant patterns of why certain sports were more/less popular at different points in the year. These results provide modern historians with a comprehensive and warranted view into the journalism of sporting entertainment in early 20th century Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Narrowing Results</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-results-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-results-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An issue faced by all the members of our group, when doing individual analysis, was getting narrower results for our related research questions, while making sure our queries still had enough relevant results. In order to tackle this issue, we devised a methodology to test the relevance of the queries used in our individual analysis. For future research projects, I have outlined the basic process below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather relevant keywords to your research question. Try to get a list of at least 5 or so words that are concise enough to yield relevant results, but not too little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run count queries for those words and keep track of how many results you get for each. If you can, look at some of the results, and see if there are any “stock words” that you can use to exclude in subsequent queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run more queries with narrower parameters and keep track of how many results are yielded. Make sure to exclude stock words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide the number of narrow queries by the more generalized result and calculate the percentage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With these percentages, you can now tell how relevant your specifications are, in regard to your larger research question. If some queries are only 2% of the larger data pool, that would likely be not as significant compared to a query of 38%. Interpreting this data and incorporating it into your individual analysis can be done however you choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall purpose of this method is to provide a quick way to clarify and measure the relevancy of potential queries you may have for your project. Seeing how correlated your queries are to larger ideas and phrases that are present in the Egyptian gazette can help gather a more concise data pool to draw on for your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-were-trying-to-accomplish-as-a-group-and-as-an-individual&#34;&gt;What we were trying to accomplish (as a group and as an individual)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this was to determine how effective a certain query was at returning results relevant to what was being researched. A lot of our initial queries returned hundreds of results, but only a certain percentage of those results contained any relevant information. Furthermore, there was often a pattern in the initial query’s results that allowed for the exclusion or inclusion of certain words or terms to help narrow things down. Because of this, we used the method of refining our initial queries and calculated a percentage to determine the relevance of the results produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of this was a query used to find associations with the word “pain” in the paper. The initial query returned 585 results with only 244 of those results being relevant. The other 341 results contained information irrelevant to what was being sought after. This means that the initial query was about 41.7% successful at returning relevant results. Obviously, there is room for improvement. Interestingly, about 31.6% of the results from the initial query contained the word “painting”. Clearly, these results were not relevant to what was being sought after, so by running the query again but excluding the word “painting” this time, the results proved to be far more relevant. This time, 61% of the results contained relevant information. This is about a 20% difference between the two queries, meaning that, now, most of the results contain relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               /post/2023-analysis-results-group/pain_hu4bfd606913c2c5c62e23585c8c1aad0a_78771_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-results-group/pain_hu4bfd606913c2c5c62e23585c8c1aad0a_78771_49a943afeb7a725be66b2270979eff39.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;454&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example was finding specific words associated with “ivory”. While Ivory itself gave 233 results, divs containing “packages ivory” came to 60 results, or roughly a quarter of all instances of Ivory. Searching for divs that contained both the words “ivory” and “tusk” gave only 12 results (5% of all results) , which meant that there was far less results to use in my analysis. By having these numbers available, I knew how I wanted to guide my research, and was able to use the 12 results for a more in-depth analysis, while packages of ivory could give raw data in discussing the context in which animals were viewed in the Egyptian gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               /post/2023-analysis-results-group/ivory_hud1a5d6f583dcd8b4b2a8f946f4a10329_85647_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-results-group/ivory_hud1a5d6f583dcd8b4b2a8f946f4a10329_85647_822d4619d36d6ed2d454e48d77d8b6f7.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example shows queries to find sections that included words associated with the Assouan Dam. This was a bit more complex as the keyword is two different words. This required the query to add sections that would include “Assouan Dam” or (“Assouan” and “Dam”) together. There were 96 initial results for “Assouan Dam” and 263 counts of “Assouan” and “Dam” not including “Assouan Dam”. This was a total of 359 results, with 114 being relevant. This shows that 32.6% of results were relevant. There were a lot of irrelevant results caused by the word “Dam”. For instance, this brought up information related to “Damascus” or “Rotterdam”. The query search was updated to look for “Assouan” and 	           “ Dam “. This included a space before and after “dam” so that it would search for whole words only. This created a total of 117 results, meaning only 3 results were not relevant. This query resulted in a 97.4% relevant return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-results-group/tableau_hubd31c8ba1203ebf52c01a78127945c9a_88352_70374c2e405a58d0a49ef044ed01c898.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph compiled all our relevancy trends into one chart, where ivory was in red, pain in teal, assouan dam in blue and Ryan’s in orange. Blue and teal each had similar trends, where the initial query was much larger than the later queries, but held less relevance. In the “pain” query case, that word gave more hits because it was in words like “painting”, which were not relevant to the analysis project. Future queries narrowed down the results, but made them more relevant to the subject being studied. Ryan’s analysis (orange) began with very few results and relevancy, and as the search went on, more accurate and functioning queries were made, which yielded more relevant results. The assoaun dam query, similar to “pain” dealt with multiple spellings and context for the dam. As the queries narrowed down, proper spelling, along with proper context increased, though total number of hits decreased. For the ivory query, there were multiple instances of the word mentioned, which had a lot of relevancy to the main topic. As the queries narrowed, they were designed to see if two subjects were at all related in relevancy, to test the hypothesis of the analysis. As the results narrowed, so to did the relevacny, which was valuable to the data gathered regarding the ivory trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-future-students-can-use-it&#34;&gt;How future students can use it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our method of breaking down larger queries into more concise, filtered results was intended to help guide early research questions, and determine what stock words could be included (or excluded) from narrower queries. For future students of this class, using a simple graph to evaluate their early queries can help them visualize how feasible their potential research topic is. Additionally, from a learning perspective, running a multitude of queries allows for students to familiarize themselves with the markup language, and provides an opportunity to tinker around and see what works and what doesn’t, while still yielding useful data in their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is designed to be easy to use, quick to analyze, and simple to explain to others, as all you need to do is find a main word to search for, and produce as many smaller queries that you would like that contain that word. It is easy enough to divide the two results and make a bar graph to see how strongly related your queries are. If a future student were to query a word, like “army” and get back thousands of results, they could run finer searches that would exclude words, include the word “british”, or only find results on the third page, and see how much that skims down their data pool. If the pool is too shallow, it may not be the best to research. But if the data pool contains enough substantial evidence, while still being reasonable to look through, then that would pose a much more compelling research topic. This methodology we’ve designed is meant to help sort out and organize this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we felt like this methodology was effective in the very early stages of posing your analysis question. Filtering out false positives (like with the word “painting”) can be done before more refined queries are made, and a general sense of what data you are working with can be seen early on. Otherwise, this method felt lackluster for the more in-depth steps of our research projects because all it can provide is a preliminary visualization of where your data will lead you. However, this process does help provide a simple foundation and direction for the task at hand and the method used was successful at doing just that. For future classes, this would be most effective as a suggestion made towards students running a large query that contains too many results to narrow down their findings, or to help those with very little results broaden their scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to make our own group since we found that our topics could be similar or related. Our topics were theaters, murder, and sports. When analyzing the similarities or how related they might be, we found that both theaters and sports were a source of entertainment, but the relationship between entertainment and murder was quite unclear. That is when we decided we had to go beyond our topics, and find something else that could benefit us all. So, after digging a bit deeper, we found that we could work on a query that could work for all of us by making a part of it easily substitutable. We also realized that something that we could focus on could be places. Location was something that could add significantly to our projects, especially since we could explore the relationship between locations that were hotspots for events in the Egyptian Gazette and locations that could be significant to our individual projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the most mentioned locations in the Gazette, we had to develop a search that would actually find the greatest number of locations. Since the place name tag isn’t used very often, we had to take another approach to accurately find locations. To do this, we first developed a set of phrases that often came before a location name, so that we could search for those and ideally the place names would follow. We chose to use the following terms: in, near, to, at, and by. There were other terms, such as “from” that often preceded place names, but those had more to do with shipping and advertisements and less to do with events occurring in these places like we were looking for. Using those phrases, we created the following regular expression search: &lt;code&gt;(in|near|to|at|by) [A-Z]\w+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would effectively search for any of our key phrases that were followed by a space, capital letter (since place names are capitalized) and the rest of that word. The space between the set of parentheses and brackets was crucial, because otherwise the search would return words that start with in or at, such as “into” or “attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that regular expression search was mostly effective, there were too many results to reasonably work with, so we had to refine our search in some way. We chose to exclude advertisements, because while advertisements often mentioned place names, they weren’t actually recording events happening. Most advertisements containing locations were talking about shipping or traveling, which we felt would skew the results towards these port cities and away from other centers of local activity. So, in our search, we added “restrict to XPath” with the following query: &lt;code&gt;//div[not(@n=”1”)]//div[not(@type=”advert”)]&lt;/code&gt;. This would eliminate the entire first page of the Gazette from our results, which was full of ads, as well as any additional advertisements that contained the div type “advert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had our results from this search, we copied them into Sublime Text to simplify them down to only the place name. We then put that list into Voyant Tools, where it ranked the words based on how often they were mentioned. Most words were place names, but there were a few that weren’t quite relevant, such as “mr.” We then went through that list manually to find the top ten Egyptian cities mentioned, as well as the top ten cities overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the most mentioned place names, we noticed that while Alexandria and Cairo were pretty common, the majority of our findings represented cities and countries outside of Egypt. This data suggests that international affairs are pretty popular or relevant to the Egyptian Gazette and its readers. While it is not something that we queried for, we do know that this is true, since when coding the issues, we encounter a lot of information on shipping, steamers, and movement of people. These recurrent topics are seen in recurrent features of the Gazette, such as Steamer Movements, Shipping Movements, and Movement Maritime. European countries specifically are also prevalent in the datelines of letters and telegrams, with a lot of communication coming from major cities like London and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the visualization we decided to use Tableau, since it opens the possibility for a more interactive representation. We geolocated each of the cities in our table (seen above) and graphed them into a map. Since the times the place was mentioned was what was really important in showing prevalence of places in the Egyptian Gazette, we modified the visualization to incorporate that. To do so, instead of just pointing out the places, we plotted dots in different sizes to showcase the amount of times the place was mentioned throughout the Gazette. Though the dots are moreless spread out with prominence in both Egypt and Europe, it is clear that the most mentions are of Egyptian places. Following Egypt would be England, which makes sense since Egypt was an English colony. Since the Gazette was not written in Arab, but in English and French it makes the most sense to have England and some english cities as second most mentioned, since the English settlers would be interested about what is going on in their own country, followed by France, to which the newspaper is sometimes addressed due to language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Performances in Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-garcia/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-garcia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my project, I decided to explore the link between theatres in Egypt and the type of performances they showcase. As a dancer, the cultural and artistic elements of different parts of the world and times have always interested me, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn more. At first, I wanted to explore which theatres were more prevalent in the Gazette, but as I explored previous projects, I realized that it was already done and that I had to focus on fixing the issues that I saw with other projects and use the corrections to be able to say more with the data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue that I saw with works preceding mine was that the x-paths followed, and queries performed were focused on the Calendar of coming events. While that is a good approach, considering that this is the place we would find the most information about events happening at the theatres, we also have to take into consideration flaws in our database. Looking exclusively on data tagged with the Calendar of Coming Events feature (@ComingEvents) would be a good search if we knew all instances of the Calendar of Coming Events were tagged with said feature and encoded in the same format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify that my statement is correct, I searched for Calendar of Coming Events by name and by feature and compared them with the number of issues encoded. To calculate the number of features encoded I used the X-Path &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][@n=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. Since these tags are included in the template with which we create and encode our files, every file has page 1 encoded and tagged this way. Looking for page 1 will therefore give me the number of issues encoded and uploaded to the repository, which are 956 issues. Using the X-Path &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;comingEvents&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; I counted the number of issues that have the section tagged with the respective feature, and I found out that only 609 issues have the Calendar of Coming events tagged with the feature tag. When looking for Calendar of Coming Events using a regular expression, I found 635 mentions of it, proving my point of the flaws in the encoding of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that issue, I decided that my queries would not be focused on the feature for the Calendar of Coming Events. To start my project, I wanted a list of theatres to focus on. To find this list, I used the regex &lt;code&gt;\w+ [A-Z]\w+ Theatre&lt;/code&gt;. Since not all of the results were useful, I cleaned up the results in Sublime text, and counted the instances in Microsoft Excel, to rank the theatres from most to least mentioned, and therefore find which theatres I should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Theatre&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zizinia Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;509&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alhambra Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;114&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;San Stefano Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abbas Helmy Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Esbekieh Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Verdi Theatre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the the feature @comingEvents was not reliable, I found an alternative way to format my searches. Since the performances are indeed listed in the Calendar of Coming Events but the feature is coded differently per issue, I used the X-path &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(., &#39;Calendar of Coming Events&#39;)]/p[contains(., &#39;Zizinia Theatre&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;, To find paragraphs that included Zizinia Theatre in divs that contained Calendar of Coming Events. I would have made my x-path look for the Coming Events headline specifically instead of just anywhere in the div that contained the words, but I noticed that not all of the issues had the title formatted as a headline. After cleaning up the results to include only the date (issue) that included the mention, and the actual performance or show, I copied and pasted the results into an excel sheet and proceeded to follow the same steps for the other theatres, substituting the theatre name in the x-path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had all the results for the different theatres, I created two tables. For both I included date of mention, theatre name, and type of presentation or form of entertainment. The difference between the two is how detailed I was when categorizing the types of entertainments. For the first one, I tried to be as specific as I could be, so the results could be compared, for example, between two really similar categories, like French Opera vs Italian Opera. For the second table, I grouped like categories into one, to make the graph easier to understand and for it to need a bit less effort to read, since there are less categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;tableauPlaceholder&#39; id=&#39;viz1702578148244&#39; style=&#39;position: relative&#39;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;Type of Entertainment per date and theatre &#39; src=&#39;https:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;public.tableau.com&amp;#47;static&amp;#47;images&amp;#47;Fi&amp;#47;Figure1_17025781094050&amp;#47;Sheet1&amp;#47;1_rss.png&#39; style=&#39;border: none&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;object class=&#39;tableauViz&#39;  style=&#39;display:none;&#39;&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;host_url&#39; value=&#39;https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;embed_code_version&#39; value=&#39;3&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;site_root&#39; value=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;name&#39; value=&#39;Figure1_17025781094050&amp;#47;Sheet1&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;tabs&#39; value=&#39;no&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;toolbar&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;static_image&#39; value=&#39;https:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;public.tableau.com&amp;#47;static&amp;#47;images&amp;#47;Fi&amp;#47;Figure1_17025781094050&amp;#47;Sheet1&amp;#47;1.png&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;animate_transition&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_static_image&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_spinner&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_overlay&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_count&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;language&#39; value=&#39;en-US&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;filter&#39; value=&#39;publish=yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                &lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;                    var divElement = document.getElementById(&#39;viz1702578148244&#39;);                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName(&#39;object&#39;)[0];                    vizElement.style.width=&#39;100%&#39;;vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+&#39;px&#39;;                    var scriptElement = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);                    scriptElement.src = &#39;https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js&#39;;                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For figure 1, I used the single count dates (day/month/year) as columns, the type of event features as rows, and represented the different theatres with different colors in the representation. Due to its shorter height, this representation does an excellent job highlighting which events were happening around the same time, and in which theatres too. For example, January 1907 shows an opera in Zizinia Theatre, a Performance in Alhambra, and a play in the Esbekieh Gardens Theatre happening in the same week. This is also the case of July 1906, where we see a Ball and a Concert at San Stefano, and a comedy at Alhambra theatre. Because of the inconsistencies in coding, the dates shown are dates in which the events were mentioned in the Calendar of Coming Events and not the day the events were happening. However, I do not consider this to be so much of a problem since the Calendar of Coming Events only shows a week of events in advance, so the dates are pretty close. Since the events are mentioned daily in the Calendar of Coming Events, we do see multiple instances of an event being repeated in a short amount of time, but since this is something that happens across all theatres and all events, it is also not a problem. If anything, this could show how important an event is, since the more times mentioned in the Calendar of Coming Events would mean that more “advertising” for the Event is being done. Since the conditions of the search are the same for all events and all theatres, I would say that if a certain event is shown more than others, it is likely a more popular event or an event of more importance to the readers. For figure 1, I also reduced the number of events I showed, merging similar events into a single category. The Italian Opera, Juvenile Opera, and French Opera, for example, are all depicted in the Opera category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#39;tableauPlaceholder&#39; id=&#39;viz1702577790413&#39; style=&#39;position: relative&#39;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#&#39;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;Type of entertainment per date and theatre &#39; src=&#39;https:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;public.tableau.com&amp;#47;static&amp;#47;images&amp;#47;Fi&amp;#47;Figure2_17025777579660&amp;#47;Sheet2&amp;#47;1_rss.png&#39; style=&#39;border: none&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;object class=&#39;tableauViz&#39;  style=&#39;display:none;&#39;&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;host_url&#39; value=&#39;https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;embed_code_version&#39; value=&#39;3&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;site_root&#39; value=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;name&#39; value=&#39;Figure2_17025777579660&amp;#47;Sheet2&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;tabs&#39; value=&#39;no&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;toolbar&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;static_image&#39; value=&#39;https:&amp;#47;&amp;#47;public.tableau.com&amp;#47;static&amp;#47;images&amp;#47;Fi&amp;#47;Figure2_17025777579660&amp;#47;Sheet2&amp;#47;1.png&#39; /&gt; &lt;param name=&#39;animate_transition&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_static_image&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_spinner&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_overlay&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;display_count&#39; value=&#39;yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;language&#39; value=&#39;en-US&#39; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#39;filter&#39; value=&#39;publish=yes&#39; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                &lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;                    var divElement = document.getElementById(&#39;viz1702577790413&#39;);                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName(&#39;object&#39;)[0];                    vizElement.style.width=&#39;100%&#39;;vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+&#39;px&#39;;                    var scriptElement = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);                    scriptElement.src = &#39;https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js&#39;;                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Figure 2, I used type of entertainment as columns and exact dates as rows. I also included the different theatres identifying them with different colors in the graph. This graph clearly shows how mentions of events in theatres increased over time. This could be due to the number of issues encoded from each year, and the fact that we have not coded the entire newspaper. This could also be due to the different ways each student codes their issues, changing the results that the x-path search would yield. Another thing that we can see in this representation is what events are showcased in more than what theatre. French Comedy, for example, was shown in Esbekieh Gardens, Zizinia Theatre, and Alhambra. Similarly, the Italian Opera was also present in different theatres, namely Verdi, Abbas Helmy, Alhambra, and Zizinia Theatre. From this figure we can see a clear shift or alteration in where the events take place. While Italian Opera was predominantly shown in Abbas Helmy in 1905, it was mainly shown in Zizinia in 1907. Other events, like concerts and ballet, remained exclusively in one theatre. Ballet performances were shown in Alhambra only, and Concerts happened in San Stafano Only.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elephants and Empire</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-lubinski/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-lubinski/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The turn of the 20th century marked a unique period, in that antiquated laws and customs were beginning to clash with an industrial, and increasingly globalized society. With these changing times, the relation between humans and animals changed too, as various exotic creatures were exploited for commercial, entertainment, or recreational purposes. I started by noticing frequent mentions of ivory sales throughout the gazette, which drew me first to reading about elephants. One common way in elephants were used was for harvesting Ivory. Despite there being laws put in place to limit the number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubuntuwildlifetrust.com/2020/10/30/african-ivory-trade-history&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;elephants being killed for their tusks&lt;/a&gt;, sale of both legal and contraband ivory was still frequent, as shown in select articles throughout the gazette. While reading through the gazette, there were also multiple instances of elephants, tigers, lions, and other animals being mentioned, as well as the context in which they were brought up. Through researching this, a better idea of how animals were viewed in the context of empire, namely in Egypt, can be better understood, and give us insight to how society viewed animals as a resource at the time. My main question in conducting this analysis was “how were animals viewed in the early 20th century?”. In order to find an answer to this question, I looked at the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, along with other supplementary materials to gain a better idea of   To begin my research, a quick look at the frequency of animal mentions was made. Below is a chart listing the most frequent words that yielded results related to animals. While the words in the graph may not seem wholly connected, these were the most frequent ways in which animals were mentioned, that also included relevant information to my analysis project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Mentions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ivory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;233&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elephant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zoo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Giraffe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hunting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Safari&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this table alone, we see that ivory sale was the primary way in which, of these three topics, animals were discussed within the gazette. It is important to note that I excluded the search for “Hunting” on its own, as there are many advertisements for hunting and fishing equipment, which is in of itself a different piece of the gazette to be analyzed. With this information, I then ran a series of queries that narrowed down my results from the broad “ivory” category. Two examples of my queries were &lt;code&gt;//p[contains(., &#39;packages ivory&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(.,&#39;ivory&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][matches(., &#39;tusks&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;. When I gathered my results from these queries, I divided the number of results yielded by the total number of instances of “ivory”, in order to get a clearer idea of how much these specifications narrowed down my results. The phrase “packages ivory” made up a startling 25.75% of all results, while ivory and tusks only made up 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visualization was made in Tableau, as it allows Through these results, it becomes clear that elephants were seen as almost a separate entity from the ivory they yielded. The body part that yielded ivory (tusks) was rarely seen associated with ivory and its sale, while packages of ivory, whether in shipping or in the market, was mentioned more frequently. There was also a spike in mentions of the Ordinance for Preservation of Wild Animals and Birds (enacted 1903) during issues in 1906, which also saw a sharp decrease in mentions of “packages ivory”. There was little association between the animal itself and all mentions of ivory, largely due to the commercial nature of the articles featuring ivory (most being the Sale of Ivory and Rubber news feature). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/london-metropolitan-archives/collections/ostrich-feather-trade&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ostrich feathers&lt;/a&gt; were another way in which animals were sought out for their material goods, and this trade worked its way through Egypt to be exported to London. While harvesting of these feathers eventually became non-lethal for the animal, it serves as another example of how animals were exploited for commercial and luxury reasons. When searching through the articles, I came across a few that discussed owning exotic animals as pets, which was quite interesting. One article had Sudan giraffes for sale, listed as a “fine pair, male and female”. Other articles discussed the Sultan’s own collection of animals, or news regarding new animals being shipped in for Cairo’s Zoological Gardens, one instance of which I’ve outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hear that Capt. Flower Bey is on his way back from the Sudan with a collection of nearly 200 living animals for the Cairo Zoological Gardens, including two elephants, several lions, and a great number of antelopes of various species.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipment of new animals to the Cairo Zoological Gardens was noteworthy enough to be mentioned in the gazette, and exotic African animals are the main ones listed in these types of articles. Other mentions of Captain Flower in the gazette list more types of animals gathered, all along the Nile river.  Along with the acquisition of animals, there is frequent mention of hunting, largely in the form of the Thomas &amp;amp; Son’s tailoring company, which offers custom tailoring for those who could afford hunting as a sport. Both these examples show how much of a fascination with hunting and collection of animals was, as entire businesses or expeditions were centered around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information in mind, the gazette begins to paint an interesting picture of how animals were viewed at the time. Elephants were seen as a separate concept to the ivory they yielded, and otherwise were rarely mentioned throughout the gazette. Between Ivory, the Zoological Gardens, and hunting for sport, along with many other small instances of purchasing exotic species, animals were seen as an entertainment resource, that the wealthy could afford to hunt, the average person could see in a zoo, and the eccentric could purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How is murder reported in the Egyptian Gazette?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-brown/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-brown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I wanted to observe how murder was reported in the Egyptian Gazette. To gauge whether or not this was a feasible topic within the Gazette, I began with the simple query: &lt;code&gt;//p[contains(., ‘murder’)]/text()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enabled me to find all of the paragraphs containing the word “murder,” as well as surrounding text to gather some more details from the search. This search yielded about 800 items, so it was clear that murder was present enough in the Gazette to do some research with. This query was appropriate for a rough estimate of murder in the Gazette, but not much else. Since it looks for a paragraph containing the word murder, it can actually count the same case of murder multiple times if it is mentioned throughout several paragraphs. I knew that I had to get more specific with my topic, but finding that murder was at least relatively relevant within the Gazette was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finalizing-a-topic&#34;&gt;Finalizing a Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial stage of my project, I considered more deeply what exactly about murder that I wanted to focus on. I decided on an approach that would use murder as a measure of how reputable the Egyptian Gazette was for news. To do so, I would first evaluate the Gazette’s colonial bias against Egyptians (referred to as “natives”) by seeing if there was any difference in the reporting of native murders compared to non-native murders. The second criteria which I would use to evaluate the Gazette would involve comparing the number of recorded murders per year to the number of actual murders per year, as provided by the Egyptian Consul General papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-querying&#34;&gt;More Querying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin these queries, I had to first determine what vocabulary would be most effective for searching. While the word “murder” had come to mind first, other words such as “homicide” and various forms of “kill” were used to describe these events. To evaluate which term was the most frequently used, I searched the following: &lt;code&gt;count(//div[contains(.,’murder’)])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the word “murder” is would be interchanged for both kill and homicide to count the instances of these words. After a search of all three terms I found that murder returned 88 divs, kill returned 406 divs, and homicide returned zero divs. While it seemed that forms of the word kill were most prevalent, I read through about twenty of the results, and they were nowhere near as relevant as those that the term “murder” had returned. Most of the divs containing some form of kill either contained “murder” elsewhere in the paragraph (if it was describing a murder) or were more relevant to war. Since instances of war and other killings in non-murderous contexts (more common than it may seem) were far too common with the search including the word kill, I decided to stick with my original search of the term murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the instances of native murders, I wanted to ensure I was using the correct vocabulary for that search as well. I had seen native and Arab most commonly used within the paper to refer to the Egyptians, so I decided to see if “Arab,” “native,” or “Egyptian” would yield the most results. For this to be relevant within the context of my project, I searched the instances of these words occurring in the same paragraph with the word murder. The query is as follows: &lt;code&gt;//div//p[matches(.,&#39;murder&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][matches(.,&#39;native&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the word “native” is was interchanged with the other two words. Within paragraphs that contained “murder,” “native” appeared to be the most frequently occurring of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a query that effectively found all of the instances of murder involving a native, I copied the results into Sublime Text and shaved them down to the date and the relevant text. I then went through all of the results and put them into an Excel sheet, noting the date of the report, who (as in what nationality) was murdered, who was responsible for the murder, and where the murder occurred. Some of the results were eliminated because they were regarding attempted murder, war, or lacked necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying all of the cases of murder in which Egyptians were either the victim, perpetrator, or both, I needed a way to identify all of the other murders in the Gazette. After some tries, I reached the following query: &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;]/div[not(@feature=&amp;quot;wire&amp;quot;)]//p[matches(.,&#39;murder&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and not(matches(.,&#39;native&#39;, &#39;i&#39;))]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, this query is able to find paragraphs containing murder that do not also contain the term native. In an attempt to hopefully eliminate news from other countries, I excluded divs with the feature “wire,” because I was noticing lots of telegrams reporting international murders within the results. This query does not account for multiple murders mentioned within separate paragraphs, nor does it eliminate uses of the word “murder” in a non-literal way (such as describing something as “murderous”). It did reduce the results down to about 424 items, which was a fairly believable number for the almost 3 1⁄2 years that are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;murder.png&#34; alt=&#34;murder&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to visualize this data in a way that would achieve three things: (1) show the proportion of native to non-native murders reported, (2) compare the total number of murder reports by the Egyptian Gazette to the actual number of murders per year and (3) show the overall trend of murder at this time in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By closely analyzing the results of the search for “murder” and “native” together, I observed that there was not a single report of a native being murdered by an Englishman or other European. While I do not have a statistic to point to the occurrences of this, it seems highly unlikely that in three full years this never happened, especially given the imperial tensions at the time. The majority of the murders reported involving Egyptians were native-on-native violence. In each one of these cases, it was made clear that the murderer was also a native by a. directly calling them that, or b. naming them in full. If it was not clear that the murderer was a native, the murderer was either not mentioned, or just simply referred to anonymously as “the murderer,” even if they had been identified and proven guilty. This is an important finding because it shows that the Egyptian Gazette is inclined to report things that reflect poorly onto the Egyptians, but strays away from reporting incidences of Europeans killing the locals. I believe that this information discredits the Egyptian Gazette as a holistic source of Egyptian news at this time period because of its bias in reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the graph, it’s clear that these native-on-native crimes make up only a small portion of which murders are being reported. Combined with murders not involving natives, most of what is reported in the Gazette makes up only roughly a quarter of all of the incidences of murder that are happening in Egypt yearly. There could be many explanations for this trend. The first is the way the Egyptian Gazette chooses to report. Perhaps they choose the murders that are more relevant or will make a more entertaining story to report. Maybe they choose not to report when an Egyptian has been killed by a European. The explanations could also lie in the cases themselves. There could be an element of privacy, or some cases may simply just not be well known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final trend that can be evaluated in this graph is the increasing number of murders in Egypt from 1905-1907. While the Gazette may not report this (their numbers seem to peak in 1906), the official documents of the Egyptian Consul General do show this. A pattern of increasing crime and civil unrest could be the result of a worsening environment between the Egyptians and the imperialist English power.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How is murder reported in the Egyptian Gazette?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-west/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-west/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I wanted to observe how murder was reported in the Egyptian Gazette. To gauge whether or not this was a feasible topic within the Gazette, I began with the simple query: &lt;code&gt;//p[contains(., ‘murder’)]/text()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enabled me to find all of the paragraphs containing the word “murder,” as well as surrounding text to gather some more details from the search. This search yielded about 800 items, so it was clear that murder was present enough in the Gazette to do some research with. This query was appropriate for a rough estimate of murder in the Gazette, but not much else. Since it looks for a paragraph containing the word murder, it can actually count the same case of murder multiple times if it is mentioned throughout several paragraphs. I knew that I had to get more specific with my topic, but finding that murder was at least relatively relevant within the Gazette was a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finalizing-a-topic&#34;&gt;Finalizing a Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial stage of my project, I considered more deeply what exactly about murder that I wanted to focus on. I decided on an approach that would use murder as a measure of how reputable the Egyptian Gazette was for news. To do so, I would first evaluate the Gazette’s colonial bias against Egyptians (referred to as “natives”) by seeing if there was any difference in the reporting of native murders compared to non-native murders. The second criteria which I would use to evaluate the Gazette would involve comparing the number of recorded murders per year to the number of actual murders per year, as provided by the Egyptian Consul General papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-querying&#34;&gt;More Querying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin these queries, I had to first determine what vocabulary would be most effective for searching. While the word “murder” had come to mind first, other words such as “homicide” and various forms of “kill” were used to describe these events. To evaluate which term was the most frequently used, I searched the following: &lt;code&gt;count(//div[contains(.,’murder’)])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the word “murder” is would be interchanged for both kill and homicide to count the instances of these words. After a search of all three terms I found that murder returned 88 divs, kill returned 406 divs, and homicide returned zero divs. While it seemed that forms of the word kill were most prevalent, I read through about twenty of the results, and they were nowhere near as relevant as those that the term “murder” had returned. Most of the divs containing some form of kill either contained “murder” elsewhere in the paragraph (if it was describing a murder) or were more relevant to war. Since instances of war and other killings in non-murderous contexts (more common than it may seem) were far too common with the search including the word kill, I decided to stick with my original search of the term murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the instances of native murders, I wanted to ensure I was using the correct vocabulary for that search as well. I had seen native and Arab most commonly used within the paper to refer to the Egyptians, so I decided to see if “Arab,” “native,” or “Egyptian” would yield the most results. For this to be relevant within the context of my project, I searched the instances of these words occurring in the same paragraph with the word murder. The query is as follows: &lt;code&gt;//div//p[matches(.,&#39;murder&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][matches(.,&#39;native&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the word “native” is was interchanged with the other two words. Within paragraphs that contained “murder,” “native” appeared to be the most frequently occurring of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a query that effectively found all of the instances of murder involving a native, I copied the results into Sublime Text and shaved them down to the date and the relevant text. I then went through all of the results and put them into an Excel sheet, noting the date of the report, who (as in what nationality) was murdered, who was responsible for the murder, and where the murder occurred. Some of the results were eliminated because they were regarding attempted murder, war, or lacked necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying all of the cases of murder in which Egyptians were either the victim, perpetrator, or both, I needed a way to identify all of the other murders in the Gazette. After some tries, I reached the following query: &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;]/div[not(@feature=&amp;quot;wire&amp;quot;)]//p[matches(.,&#39;murder&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and not(matches(.,&#39;native&#39;, &#39;i&#39;))]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, this query is able to find paragraphs containing murder that do not also contain the term native. In an attempt to hopefully eliminate news from other countries, I excluded divs with the feature “wire,” because I was noticing lots of telegrams reporting international murders within the results. This query does not account for multiple murders mentioned within separate paragraphs, nor does it eliminate uses of the word “murder” in a non-literal way (such as describing something as “murderous”). It did reduce the results down to about 424 items, which was a fairly believable number for the almost 3 1⁄2 years that are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Medicine and Ailments in The Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-cavaliere/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-cavaliere/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I decided to investigate the various medications advertised in the paper. The reason why I chose this was because of the crazy claims these advertisements made. Medication and remedies for certain illnesses and pains have existed for a very long time. However, regulations to produce these medications didn’t come along until way later. The earliest of these regulations started with voluntary drug approval in 1905, but it wasn’t until 1938 when regulations for drug safety were put in place (FDA, 2006). Because of this, a lot of these pharmaceutical companies could get away with making medications out of questionable ingredients and claiming that they cure a whole list of symptoms (Library of Congress). Most of these medications were manufactured in the U.S., as the country was one of the leaders in the pharmaceutical industry at the time (Hamilton, 1951). These medications were then exported to other parts of the world, including Alexandria, Egypt where advertisements for these medications appeared in the local newspaper. My goal with this project was to look at what health issues and medications were brought up the most in the newspaper, The Egyptian Gazette, with the purpose of finding correlations between the two and to paint a picture of what health and pharmacy were like in Alexandria in the early 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, I started by coming up with a list of medications advertised in the paper. This proved to be slightly difficult since all the advertisements are different and none of them are labeled the same. Instead, I tried to find a specific word that all the medication advertisements had in common. This word wound up being the word “druggist” since all the medication advertisements contained a line and distribution containing this word. I was then able to use the query &lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(., ‘druggist’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt; to find all the divs containing this word and, therefore, all the medications advertised. From there, I was able to comprise a list of 11 medications. The shortcoming of using this query, however, is that I probably missed any medications that had advertisements that did not contain this word. From there, I took each medication and used the query &lt;code&gt;count(//div//div[matches(., “medication name”, ‘i’)])&lt;/code&gt; to find the number of times each of these 10 medications were advertised in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding all the medications, I wanted to find out what ailments were mentioned the most in the paper. This was accomplished by looking at certain keywords associated with the word “pain”. The query used was &lt;code&gt;\w+ \w+ pain\w* \w+ \w+&lt;/code&gt; with the word “paint” being excluded in order to limit the number of false positives in my results. After this, the results were counted to see what ailments were associated the most with the word “pain”. The results of this query and the previous one were then analyzed and made into visualizations using Tableau.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first visualization shows the results of the medication advertisements in the paper. Peruna by far had the most advertisements with 372, followed closely by Dr. William’s pink pills with 302. All other medications had less than half as many advertisements in the paper with some only having a handful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next visualization shows the results of the ailments associated with “pain”. Back pain and rheumatism appeared the most frequently with 87 and 68 hits respectively. Chest pain and headaches have about half as many hits as rheumatism with 29 and 23. All other ailments produced less than 20 hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some further research on each of the medications, some correlations can be made from these two sets of results. Back pain and rheumatism were two of the biggest complaints for ailments mentioned in the paper. Interestingly, the second most advertised medication, Dr. William’s pink pills, claims to be a treatment for rheumatism while the fourth most advertised medication, Doan’s backache and kidney pills, claims to be a treatment for backaches. So, it is clear that joint and back problems were common back in the early 1900s and medications for them were in high demand, hence the large number of advertisements. However, this pattern does not hold true for every medication. On the other hand, Peruna was by far the most advertised medication and is said to treat catarrh, but catarrh was only associated with pain a total of 4 times in the paper. This is a limitation of the query used. Catarrh is an illness caused by the buildup of mucus in the nose and throat, and while there are a few instances of illnesses being associated with “pain”, illnesses and diseases tend to not be described as painful (NHS, 2022). Therefore, very little of the results are made up of illnesses. A similar problem occurs with the third most advertised medication, Sanitas. Sanitas is a disinfectant used against bacterial infections. Bacterial infections were not associated at all with “pain”. This may be because bacterial infections weren’t considered to be painful, but other factors could’ve influenced this as well. For instance, bacterial and parasitic infections weren’t as common among the upper-class citizens who read this paper as they were for the working class, which is probably why these infections weren’t necessarily mentioned (Derr, 2019). This is also probably why there weren’t many medications advertised in the paper that treated these kinds of infections, as parasitic and bacterial infections were contracted mostly by the people working in the riverbanks and cotton fields (Derr, 2019). Overall, most of the other medications tend to follow the initial trend. Pastilles Valda, a remedy for chest pain, is the sixth most advertised medication while chest pain is the third most mentioned ailment. Doan’s dinner pills and Angier’s Emulsion are both stomach medications ranking at eighth and ninth for most advertised while stomach pain is the fifth most mentioned ailment. Despite the limitations, there is a trend of supply and demand that can be seen. For future studies, it may be beneficial to broaden the scope of the query used for ailments to include illnesses, diseases, and infections, which would help get an even more accurate idea of what health and pharmacy looked like in Alexandria in that time period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Culprit of Death</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-schefstad/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-schefstad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my studies of the Egyptian Gazette, I always wondered how diseases affected the lifestyles and events of history. There was very minimal medicine research in this time period of 1904-1908, so death from illness seemed to be very common. When I found out about this project, I decided to try to gather information on what diseases affected the population the most. When I started querying, I was just simply searching using the word “disease”. I found interesting results, but I felt that there had to be more. I then started searching with the keywords “illness” and “plague”. I found more results and different types of conditions. Once I gathered some data, I started doing a more detailed query of searching for two words located in the same paragraph. I first started off with searching for “illness” and “death” in the same paragraph. I got minimal results, only 16 with three deaths reported from three different illnesses. This confirmed my thought of how illness wasn’t a descriptor in this time, and it seemed that illness was a word to describe less serious conditions. To prove, the main query for the word illness had 1,376 results. Next, I searched for “disease” and “death” in the same paragraph and got significantly more results. I was able to get a close estimate for the number of deaths from eleven diseases. Also, this query had more relevant results. Lastly, I searched for plague and death in the same paragraph and 1450 results. This helped me conclude that plague was more commonly used to describe conditions. Also, many of the conditions’ formal names had “plague” in them, which also led to more results. Throughout my searching time, I wrote down the data. When it came time to display the data, I initially chose to use a pie chart. However, I was recommended that this method was ineffective, so I changed the display to bar graphs. This helps the reader to get a better visual of the differences in the data. What sets my project apart from others studying a similar topic is that I do a more efficient search process by using three different key words instead of just one broad search. Also, I look at other readings and get a broad viewpoint on the topic. Thus, the trial-and-error process of this project allowed me to get a better understanding of the data, and the outside source (described below) helped me link the data together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illness and Death Query only had 3 deaths from three different illnesses: Long illness, meningitis, and small pox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div//div[matches(.,&#39;illness&#39;,&#39;i&#39;)] [matches(.,&#39;death&#39;,&#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;: 16 Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.1% of illness query: &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(., &amp;quot;illness&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;: 1376 Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a description of the causes of diseases, I re-read a reading from one of our assigned readings called “Cruel Summer”. It talks about the illnesses mentioned in the data above, but it also brings up new diseases. First, a huge factor in the impact of diseases is the seasons. In Egypt, the dryness of Spring served as a carrier for diseases, and the air was not good for the lungs. On the other hand, warm weather stimulated the parasites lurking in the crops. Bacterial eye infections were extremely common from the summer heat. Farmers realized that there needed to be a change with the maintenance of crops, causing irrigation to be a new technique brought to the table. The title “Cruel Summer” is fitting for this article because of how the people suffered with the heat-induced diseases. Linking to the data, the article mentions that a very prevalent disease in agriculture was bilharzia. The article explains the cause of the virus, which isn’t mentioned in the gazette. It is caused by open skin wounds contacting water that contains the parasite. Also, for the demographics of infections, men were most vulnerable to parasite infection. At around 1908, scientists like Bonte Elgood were studying anatomy and trying to see what parts of the body the diseases affected. Also, new research methods started developing. For example, Elgood did a study of finding a percentage of urine samples with a certain virus. Next, it was obvious that World War I caused disease to spread because of the transportation of goods and soldiers. As the world was improving in technology and transportation, Egypt was seeing more diseases. This was at the threshold of new medicine advances. In summary, the data from the gazette and “Cruel Summer” link together and explain the context of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Assouan Dam</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-macalka/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2023-analysis-macalka/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic I chose was the significance of the Assouan Dam in The Egyptian Gazette. Ichose this topic because I thought it would be interesting to research something that is not insideCairo or Alexandria, which makes up a majority of the Gazette’s news. When looking for a topic,I found trouble trying to find something that was significant on a global scale or at least outsideof Egypt and the Gazette. I found the Assouan Dam when I saw almost an entire half-pagededicated to it, and after further research found a story that had continued throughout the fouryears of news that is available. Assouan was an area that was both rich in agriculture as well astourism and historical importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located on the border of the Upper Nile and Lower Nile, a dam was built in 1902 to helpthe agricultural industry as well as to protect Philae, an island in the Nile with an ancient templecomplex. The temples were built around 6th-7th Century BC and is Assouan’s biggest touristattraction even to this day. Due to Philae being a small island that had little elevation, it wasprone to flooding if there was no control on the water level. Cotton, grains, and lentils weremajor crops that would be exported to Cairo and presumably around the world. It required theNile to be at a steady level so that the fields would not get flooded. In early 1905, articles in theGazette showed people complaining that the dam was not high enough and floods wouldeventually come and ruin Philae and the crops. However, the government did not care, and theydid not raise the dam. In 1906, architects or scientists would show how the flooding is on track tobreach the dam. In late 1906, letters to the editor included some stern messages to thegovernment demanding for money to be allocated to the raising of the dam, still with no success.In July 1907, the dam flooded and ruined a lot of fields and flooded Philae, causing extensivedamage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was included in the Gazette likely because Assouan was a major agricultural hubthat would supply Alexandria and Cairo with crops. When I researched other reasons Assouanwas included in the newspaper, the most common appearances were in the export and importsections, as well as stating when ferries or boats were departing from a port to go to Assouan.This was also included because the federal government was responsible for allocating funds tothe construction and re-raising of the dam, not a local government. The Letter to the Editorssection included several messages from people who were complaining or demanding thesechanges in Assouan, so that made it a big deal up in North Egypt where the Gazette waspublished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis project looks at The Egyptian Gazette to see what context the Assouan Damis in throughout the newspaper. Originally using the ‘Find/Replace’ tool inside Oxygen XML, Icame across a lot of improper results for a lot of key words or phrases. Another issue I cameacross was word capitalization. I added a tag in my queries to make the word searches not casesensitive. Lastly, another tweak I made when querying was for the word ‘dam’ adding spacesbefore and after (‘ dam ‘) so that it would pick up whole words rather than parts of words such as ‘Damascus’. Instead of finding how many times each word was said as well, I decided to countinstances based on the number of sections included each term. This created a constant for allwords as well, just showing how relevant they were instead of how common a word was stated.One section could repeat “Assouan Dam” ten times and be as relevant as a section whose headeris “Assouan Dam” and it not stated again in the paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XML query format I used throughout this entire project was &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;]/div/p[matches(., ‘assouan’, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; or if there was multiple words I needed to search for, &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;]/div/p[matches(., &#39;asso&lt;/code&gt;uan&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;) and matches(., &amp;rsquo; dam &amp;lsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to querying, I read about 20 sections that talked about the dam in order to see whatwas relevant to the topic. I found that a majority of sections about the dam talked or referred toone of three topics: agriculture, architecture, or the government. After initial querying, I foundthat some sections would not show up, so I had to group some keywords together into a section.Government was independent, agriculture included ‘irrigation’, while architecture included ‘temple’ and ‘Philae’. I wanted to visualize the instances of these sections in a way that wasdifferent than a bar graph. Bar graphs are efficient in showing one dimension, which is countinginstances. However, I added another dimension to the data visualization by showing overlap ofinstances between two or three keywords as well. A lot of important keywords were related,which stems back to my research topic. In order to visualize my data, I used Adobe Photoshop tocreate a landscape of rectangles that would clearly show a size difference that was based on thenumber of instances. I could not use squares or the exact same ratio rectangles because thenumber of keywords I queried for would not fit visually. In order to adapt to this issue, I made the equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances × 1000 = size of rectangle (in pixels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the instances was multiplied by 1000, this did not mean this was the heightand width of the rectangle. 1000 was my starting point, however it was often reduced to cater tosize restrictions. If I cut 1000 in half, I would multiply the number of instances by 2 so that theshape has the exact same number of pixels still. This effectively showed the number of instancesof each term despite occasionally having different ratios. Most shapes had a width of 1000, 500,333.3, 250, or 200, all of which were easily divisible of 1000. This meant the heights of shapeswere commonly instances multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete results are following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each shape represents the number of instances. A scale is in the bottom left corner forreference. Some of the major words feature their counts for viewers to understand. Any squarewhere a ‘+’ is present means both or all of these terms are present in a section. Because ‘Assouan’ is the main keyword, despite it being the third largest, I gave it a textured design tohelp it stick out more. Shapes with a blue or similar background are related to government,yellow, gold, and orange is agriculture, greens are related to architecture, while pinks and purplesare unrelated to any of those three major topics. Inside the ‘Assouan’ shape is ‘Assouan Dam’,where inside that is what other keywords are combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main data that was collected is nearly impossible to read without zooming in. Thefollowing zoomed images show ‘Assouan Dam’ in relation to ‘Assouan’, as well as the ‘AssouanDam’ topics alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Section Agr. refers to (Assouan Dam + Agriculture + Irrigation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Section Arch. refers to (Assouan Dam + Architecture + Philae + Temple)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Section Other refers to sections that do not include any of the following terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Assouan Dam’ was referenced 117 times in the Gazette in the available issues. 114 ofthese were related to the three main topics, with only 3 being unrelated to any of those. Therewere no instances of ‘Assouan Dam’, ‘Architecture’, and ‘Agriculture’ all in the same section.However, there were 3 instances of ‘Assouan Dam’, ‘Government, and ‘Agriculture’ in the samesection, hence the shape between the two. One of the sections that was in the ‘Other’ categorywas an obituary to a deceased Assouan Dam construction worker. The other two both werebroadly about water levels. I did not make this its own section because it was not includingstatistics and it just was not relevant in the general scope of the dam throughout the Gazette.There were also only two instances, so it just did not seem appropriate to give its own section,and it fits nowhere better than ‘Other’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found most interesting was how close the three major topics were in the numberof instances. This really shows that there was not one topic that had more significance thananother in the Egyptian Gazette. What it also shows is how significant the dam is to the Gazette.Over the span of about 38 months, it appeared in 117 sections. If it was only mentioned in onesection per day without multiples, this would mean it was brought up in 117 days during roughlya 1,140-day period. I do not know exactly how much attention a topic needs to be significant, butI would imagine seeing the dam in about 10% of issues over 4 years is pretty significant.Although I did not collect the dates of all these instances, I noticed that a good number ofsections that fell under the ‘government’ section came in late 1907 and in 1908 after the floodingoccurred. This makes me believe that in the issues that come after what I have access to arelikely going to include ‘government’ sections at an increased rate. Most of the sections talkedabout how the government responded to the flooding, or people writing editorials complainingabout the lack of help the government offered before and after the flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential future project could be looking at how these instances progressed by year inorder to see if there were trends. Perhaps using this chart and making the solid color a gradientbased on how many instances each topic saw in a year or month even. Another question I have iswondering if the most significant topic connected to Assouan was not the dam. The mostcommon results are through advertisements and ferries, but I would like to compare the damtopic in its entirety to another topic if there is a major one present.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Question of Levantine Immigration</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-alrahil/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-alrahil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-and-historical-context&#34;&gt;Introduction and Historical Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East and North Africa are regions particularly known for its different eras and patterns of shifting or displacing the locations of its populaces over the past centuries. In being this cross-section of trade and travel throughout the world, it is evident that this rich context would impact its future with both foreign involvement and foreign adventure. Within the late 18th and early 19th century, whether by economic strife, political oppression, religious persecution, or some other outlying factor, there was a new mass migratory movement from the Levantine Ottoman Empire. Between the years of 1880 and 1924 around a half million Levantine Arabs left their homelands to  obtain a sense of freedom economically, socially, and politically within the Americas, North, Central, and South (Fahrenthold). Recent economic forces had started to link the Mediterranean and Atlantic newly capitalistic economies, and in doing so created a labor vacuum that easily brought in these new Arab migrants (Fahrenthold). Egypt served as an integral part to this process in multiple ways, most principally being one of the major channels  through which Levantine migrants had to pass in order to begin their journey to the Americas (Hitti 62) or by the fact that first Arabic periodicals from the Americas appeared in Egypt which then spurred a strong network of global readership between the US, Latin America, and Egypt (Fahrenthold). It is evident that by more than proximity but rather direct involvement with this phenomenon lends it to be something that could be particularly interesting in Egyptian society, and through that perhaps of note within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; itself. This analysis pursues this question, with the idea of the mention and opinion of Levantine migration found within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;topic-discussion&#34;&gt;Topic Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall question is the discussion and portrayal of Levantine migration within &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, which was prompted by my coincidental finding of a small blurb about “Syrian Immigration to Jamaica” that I found in the local and general section of one of the editions I was encoding. This led to the curiosity of whether other forms of Levantine migration were mentioned, and if so, how often, where,why, and in what light. In essence this topic begets itself to be qualitative work and analysis, which contrasts to the more quantitative leaning of the class and project; however, I deem it reflective as to what Digital Humanities is as a whole, as DIH work is based in this cross-section of the qualitative and the quantitative as a form of computational history. This mindset imbued itself into my attitude towards the project directly affected my method in querying this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;querying-process-visualizations-and-overall-findings&#34;&gt;Querying Process, Visualizations, and Overall Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My querying process used a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches through my employment of multiple X-Paths. The more quantitative X-Path used was &lt;code&gt;count(//p[matches(., &amp;quot;migration&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;) or matches(., &amp;quot;migrant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)])&lt;/code&gt; . I utilized this to gain a numerical look at how often these two words were mentioned to 1) dissect if there was a consistent pattern of repeated use during certain months or years and 2) to compare with a graph sourced from Kemal Karpat and utilized by Stacy Fahrenthold  that demonstrated the “Annual Rate of Immigration to the United States from Turkey in Asia” [the Levant] (Fahrenthold).. In comparing these two graphs I would be able to see if there is a correlation with higher immigration rates to higher mention rates within the &lt;strong&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/strong&gt;. The visualizations can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

      annual rate of immigration from Turkey in Asia
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In analyzing the three visualizations it is evident the rise of immigration from 1905-1908 is mirrored by the increasing reference of migration within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, along with the simultaneous decrease in 1908. A weakness of this X-path/question is made apparent by the Karpat graph, in the sense that the database simply does not have the dates available where we see the highest peaks in immigration. Within this Xpath and the ones to discuss next, there was an issue with only getting a smaller number of hits than would be deemed useful or substantial. Especially for quantitative analysis, the limited range of hits impacts the substantialness of the data itself. However, if the mirroring trends made apparent with the current data set are accurate, then it could set the groundwork for predicting the use of migration in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my more qualitative exploits used and tested out a myriad of Xpaths which included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//p[matches(., &amp;quot;immigration&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;) or matches(., &amp;quot;migrant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]/parent::div/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot; and matches(., &amp;quot;immigration&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot; and matches(., &amp;quot;migration&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//p[matches(., “levant”, “i”) and matches(., &#39;Syrian&#39;, “i”)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After employing them, I would go through and read the results that came up since they rarely exceeded 200 items max. In doing so I would see the context in which the word was used and the connotation and description surrounding it to try to garner the opinion or viewpoint of the readers and contributors to the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; surrounding not only topics of migration but the community I am particularly focusing on: Levantine/Syrian. I made note of a dichotomy between the positive outlook towards migration from the Islamic Egyptian perspective and the negative connotation surrounding British based ideas on the matter. For the Egyptian perspective I found in part 5.4 of the 1906-02-14 edition emigration being described as being “useful”, “advisable”, and “being approved by the Prophet” but that also Egyptians must be very cognizant of where and when they emigrate so that they can ensure they have assured rights and privileges in the countries they migrate to. In comparison, a lot of mentions of migration or of Levantines/Syrians that seemed to come from British sources or directed and British audiences have a negative or degrading connotation around them. Across multiple issues they are described as ignorant, fickle, lacking a high standard of morality, etc, and a lot of policy is promoted or discussed surrounding the fact that their and other East Asian immigration to the West should be limited because of their background. This duality of perspectives reflect the overarching viewpoints on Levantine immigration by the East and West during that era, and so interestingly despite a low return rate of hits, the information made available provided a useful insight as to how the portrayal of such is reflected within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-on-the-process-and-implications-for-the-_gazette_&#34;&gt;Reflection on the Process and Implications for the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is a lot more experimentation that could be done with different Xpath results to garner more data surrounding this topic, as so much experimentation was needed to get the limited data I had now . I believe the groundwork laid here can be used as a structural basis into which to analyze this topic once more editions of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; are digitally encoded, and that even more trends and relations between migrational patterns and mentions in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; can potentially be seen using the combo comparative quantitative methodology and qualitative digging demonstrated here. This project has spurred an acceptance within me that the work of a historian is never ending.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Death and Violent Crime in Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-deptula/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-deptula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crime in Alexandria has always been a topic of discussion among the people that call it home and in the newspapers that those people read. Throughout studying The Egyptian Gazette, there are recurring themes regarding the improvement and deterioration of crime in Alexandria. Throughout the early 1900s, the frequency of crime varied extremely, as the people of Alexandria experienced new things every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any society throughout history, crime was a very common theme among society. Through scouring the Judicial Adviser Reports &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xa8w9338b7yoyow/AADjpeAbqmqfe3_5PYE4dpdja?dl=0&amp;amp;preview=Judicial-adviser-1905.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Judicial Adviser Report&lt;/a&gt;, I found that there were about 2000 crimes a year. As said before though, the crimes that most interested me were those of violence and occasionally a resulting death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Egyptian Gazette death is reported on regularly. I used an X-Path to search for all the headings of &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s that contained the words “dead” and “death.” This query paid no regard to whether the words were lowercase or uppercase, by searching &lt;code&gt;//body/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’))]/head&lt;/code&gt;. This search gave me 3456 returns from throughout the newspaper. Through doing this research, I found that although death was constantly reported on, not all the results were death involving murder or violent crime. There were a vast majority of other hits that came back regarding death from other means such as suicide and sickness. Throughout the Egyptian Gazette, violent crime was also customarily reported on. Through using the X-path, &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’violent crime’,’i’)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;, I found that violent crime was reported on not nearly as much as death. Just as death encompasses a lot of facets outside of murder, such as suicide, sickness, and natural death, violent crime has a lot of things to report on as well. Among these crimes were vicious acts such as arson, robbery, and assault. This leads to a massive number of reports for death, murder, and violent crime. Through more searching within the entire content repository, using xpaths searching for key words such as “arson” and “robbery,” I was able to narrow down my results regarding violent crime even more. Arson was reported on about as much as robbery, and the sum of the two of them was more than the quantity in which violent crime was reported on. I think that this is because although “violent crime,” seems like a broad search term, that it just is not mentioned as much as the specific crimes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-deptula/Picture1_hu41b7daffd69b8de21790264fc50a16fb_158688_716a43d79a3e36fcf2d76918f71f38ec.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above data visualization, the actual types of violent crime are reported a lot more than violent crime itself. In the Egyptian gazette, the actual crime is reported a lot less frequently than it is accounted for in the judicial adviser reports written by the government. I think that this could be for various reasons. The main reason in which I think that crime and death is not reported as frequently as it is actually committed is because the newspaper tries to maintain a positive tone and mood. On the contrary though, I think that the newspaper should also be reporting events like these to keep the people of Egypt updated and informed on what is going on among them. As you can see in the data visualization, there is also a major discrepancy between the frequency in which violent crime in general is reported in the Egyptian Gazette than in the Judicial Adviser Reports. The coverage of crime in the Egyptian Gazette is not nearly as proportionately covered as it should be.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00263206.2012.691744?casa_token=bRmCaRubK1oAAAAA:hwMHaKLC-4C1WzzlHSIMMxWfOdFthLVUmSBq8_mb4bAGV3xF7lZb_LiXRZIx7Vg8fxaJNP6y4V0rBw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The British in Egypt. Community, Crime and Crises, 1882–1922&lt;/a&gt; by Saul Kelly, there was also just far more material on the ruling elite than the common folk. As a result, most crime was committed by the common folk so although it was accounted for in the Judicial Adviser reports it was not reported on as much. This is what I also think lead to less crime being actually reported in the newspapers than was being committed. No one wants to read about the &amp;ldquo;average joe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;common folk&amp;rdquo; guy next door getting killed or robbed, they like to hear about the elites getting themselves into trouble which occured much less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many factors also contribute to the increase or decrease of crime that transcend people’s free will to do as they please. In the years that farmland was uncultivated, there was always an increase in theft and robbery due to a subsequent increase in poverty and desperation for sustenance. As the people of Egypt got more desperate and there was more unrest, the murder rates also increased. Whether it was an increase in land disputes because of fiscal hardship or a lack of prevention by public security, murder and crime, unrest ran rampant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Black Monday 1987. The 2007-2008 Financial Crisis. Wall Street Crash of 1929. Financial
Crises go down in history as awful periods of time. Mass unemployment, smaller dinners,
starving times. Egypt fell into a recession in late 1906 - early 1907s, but how were different
markets of the Egypt economy affected by the crash? Can X-Path analysis tell us anything
about the origins and impact of the crash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a series of cell-measure commands in X-path, I scanned the repository of
newspapers produced in Cairo in the 1900s to find the share price of three companies each in
different markets of the microeconomy. Record the share price each time they show up in the
issues and plot them to see the impact on each market specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After importing the data into google sheets, I was able to produce the above chart. We can see
the share prices dip in the 1906-1907 due to the crash. However, the crash seems to be equally
devastating to each market of the microeconomy in Cairo, and most surprisingly, the banks are
the most stable throughout the crash despite the nature of stock market crashes attacking the
banks first due to loan squeezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, when you look up the stock market crash of 1907 in egypt. Most of the searched
results are about the New York stock crisis in 1907 and not about the crash in the
microeconomy of Egypt/Cairo. Country economies are like gears in a system, when one stops
or slows down, others are bound to be affected. The same effect can be seen in the stock
crashes in both Egypt and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the data and specific results I retrieved from X-Path should be taken lightly due
to many errors and inconsistencies I found in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s Going on with Religion in the Egyptian Gazette?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-obos/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-religions-being-covered&#34;&gt;The Religions being covered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt is home to many different religions, however, I only plan to talk about the main religious groups in Egypt as well as one smaller group as a comparison. The two largest religious groups of Egypt are the Muslim community and the Christian community, with the Muslim community in particular making up the majority of the religious influence in the country. The smaller religious group I am talking about is Judaism, while Judaism is a very large religion internationally in the country of Egypt it is and has been dying out. To give accurate numbers, as stated in &lt;a href=&#34;https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/egyptian-culture/egyptian-culture-religion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Cultural Atlas&lt;/a&gt; “The vast majority of the Egyptian population (90%) identify as Muslim, mostly of the Sunni denomination. Of the remaining population, 9% identify as Coptic Orthodox Christian and the remaining 1% identify with some other denomination of Christianity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;graph&#34;&gt;Graph&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Paragraphs in each issue that mention “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan”
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph that appears above can be complicated to understand, so I figured that I should break it down and make it more understandable for most viewers. This graph is a visualization of how often the words “Jew”, “Christian”, and “Mohammedan” are mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I chose these words as they are the most common ways to refer to the people of these religions in Egypt and so are best suited for finding this information in the Egyptian Gazette. The information is separated into months throughout the years 1904-1907, the red line is the word “Jew”, the blue line is “Christian”, and the green line is “mohammedan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;judaism&#34;&gt;Judaism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish people as a whole are a very small part of the Egyptian population with there only being three Jews in the entirety of egypt as of right now. Why, then, does the graph above show that the word “Jew” is mentioned often in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the answer to this is that the Egyptian Gazette was not based around talking about the local groups but more the world and the news involved as whole, this would make far more sense as the news about Judaism in the world would coincide with the high number of mentions of the word “Jew”. As I researched some important events that occurred in Judaism over the years of 1904-1907 I came across a large event that must have caused the News to talk about it for many years. This was the Russian Revolution of 1905, which was a revolution that had an incredibly large amount of Jewish people in it, due to the horrible discrimination being put upon them by the Russian government. As stated in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4205328#metadata_info_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The role of the Jews in the Russian Revolutionary Movement&lt;/a&gt; “While the Jews formed only seven million out of a total population of 136 million, about fifty percent of the membership of the Revolutionary parties was Jewish”. This event had long and big impacts on Judaism as a whole and would have most definitely provided a big spike in Jewish news throughout the world. This is, in my opinion, a strong reason for the large amount of time that the word “Jew” is mentioned in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette. I must also mention that while the word “Jew” was mentioned many times in the Gazette there is also a possibility that the word “Jew” could be a part of something else such as the name of a place or part of the word Jewel, however I believe that the vast majority of these mentions were based in talking about Judaism instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;christianity&#34;&gt;Christianity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity as whole is one of the largest religions in the entire world boasting around 2.2 billion followers around the world. This humongous religion is also a large part of Egypts religious groups making up around 9% of the people in Egypt. However, as we have learned with Judaism and the word “Jew” being a large part of Egypt does not seem to be a big factor in if a religion is mentioned more or not in the Egyptian Gazette. I believe that the large amounts of mentions of the word “Christian” in paragraphs of the Egyptian Gazette is due to simply how big and notable of a religion Christianity is as a whole. Due to Christianities size there is always news and things going on that involve the word “Christian” hence the large amount of hits. The Egyptian Gazette is able to report on the news inside the country involving Christians as well as the many other important things going on with the religion outside of it. One notable Christian event that could coincide with the high number of times the word “Christian” appears could be the Indian Pentecost occurring in India in 1905. As talked about in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/2008/august/indian-pentecost.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Indian Pentecost&lt;/a&gt; the Indian Pentecost was a large religious movement in India where Christianity had a sudden and strong revival in the country due to various missionaries spreading their message. This had little to no effect on India however it most definitely made the news and caused a large influx in the amount of time the word “Christian” appeared in the Egyptian Gazette. This and many more events involving Christianity are constantly occurring around the world so to see such a high amount of times that Christianitty is mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette comes as little surprise to me. There is also the fact that sometimes the word “Christian” doesn’t always mean Christianity as it could be a name or a place. I do believe however, that the majority of the times that the word “Christian” appears is based around Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;islam&#34;&gt;Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam is the absolute biggest religion in the country of Egypt with is spanning a humongous number of ninety percent of the population as a whole. Why, then, you might as it is mentioned so little in the Egyptian Gazette as opposed to less notable religions in Egypt such as Judaism. I believe there are a couple of answers to this question, one of the most notable in my opinion is that the Egyptian Gazette focused more on outside news when it comes to religion as opposed to inside news so the mentions of Islam become smaller as opposed to Christianity and Judaism. Another and the most likely is that because the Gazette talked about outside news they don’t use the word “Mohammedan” as often as they would if it was about religion inside the country. This is due to the fact that while Mohammedan is a common word to refer to the Islamic people in Egypt, it is less common throughout the world. Therefore, the mentions of the word “Mohammedan” in the Egyptian Gazette focus more on the local and national news as opposed to the more widespread international news that the Gazette prefers to talk about when it comes to religion. After researching various sources I have also learned that Islam also was not a very active religion in the time period set with the Egyptian Gazette. The only thing of note was that the Ottoman empire was falling which was having some effect on Judaism but was also just bigger news that would subvert news about Judaism. This lack of Islamic news could also play a part in why the word “Mohammedan” is mentioned so little in the Egyptian Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-and-final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Comparison and Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three religions have provided me with many different conclusions and new information that I would never have known or thought of before. I have learned of the Egyptian Gazettes preference for international news, as well as how the local population of that religion does not affect the Egyptian Gazette very much in how often they talk about a certain religion. Christianity and Judaism are mentioned far more often that Islam both because thy had more newsworthy things occur in this time period but also because the word “Mohammedan” is less used in international news. I also have another theory as to why Judaims and Christianity are mentioned so often in the Egyptian Gazette. My theory is that due to the close ties religiously between Judaism and Christianity they are more often mentioned together or in comparison to each other than what would occur with Islam. Thus would lead to more results when it comes to the words “Jew” and “Christian”  as they could be mentioned in a story about the other religion. Even so, without all of these theories it is a fact that in the Egyptian Gazette, in a total expectation subversion for me, the word “Jew” appears the most out of these three words, “Christian” the second most, and “Mohammedan” the least. This is completely different from what I was expecting when I started this project and has allowed me to research more in depth and learn more things about why a newspaper like the Egyptian Gazette would talk more about each religion and how this came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Causes of the Changing Death Rate</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-combs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-combs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Death and its causes are widely reported in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, however it is not reported equally at all times of the year. Knowing the months when death is most common allows for further analysis on what causes the death rate to change throughout the year. This can also be done with the various causes of death such as murder. This knowledge gives some insight into what it was like to live in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the question of what causes the death rate to change throughout the year I first ran the x-path query &lt;code&gt;count(//div[matches(., &#39;dea[d,th]&#39;,&#39;i&#39;)])&lt;/code&gt;. I also ran the same x-path query for murder, suicide, plague, and cholera because those where all common causes of death at the time. The first thing I noticed in the death rate is that it consistently rises from July through September before it drops then peaks in January. This increase in death during the summer months can be explained by looking at the rates for murder and plague, which both have higher rates during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.natchitochestimes.com/2022/07/19/why-does-crime-increase-in-the-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nathan Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, even in modern times the summer months are when crimes are at its peak, including violent crimes such as murder. One cause of this is that the temperatures are simply higher than they are at other times of the year. The belief is that the discomforting higher temperature “acts as a stressor and alters the brain’s chemistry”. This makes people irritable and prone to anger, which would naturally cause more people to commit murder in the heat of the moment. Egypt has longer daylight hours in the summer months than any other time of year. The longer daylight hours coupled with the elevated temperature cause people to have lower quality sleep than they would otherwise. This lower quality sleep has been linked to impulsivity and aggression, which can also cause people to commit murder in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increase in the murder rate is not the only reason that the death rate rises in the summer. The amount of reported cases of the plague is also much higher around the same time that the death rate was increased.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174245/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tamara Ben-Ari et al.&lt;/a&gt;, there are many factors that affect rodent fleas. Some of these factors include ambient temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. When there is warm and moist weather then there will likely be more fleas. Flea development also increases with temperature, until it reaches a certain point. If the temperature is too high and the humidity is too low then the survival rate for immature fleas will drop. This would explain the rates of the plague seen in The Egyptian Gazette because while the plague frequency is consistently higher in the summer, sometimes it seems to randomly drop prematurely. This is likely due to either the temperature rising too high or the humidity dropping too low, if not both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult trend in the death rate is the peak that occurs in the winter months, despite the fact that both the murder rate and the plague frequency are usually lower in the same periods. The suicide rate is much more random that any other cause of death so it serves to explain some isolated months such as December 1906, but it does not explain why the death rate regularly peaks at this time. Similarly, the cases of cholera are low throughout the year, except for January 1908, which appears to have had an outbreak of sorts, which can explain the high death rate in that month, but nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that this heightened death frequency is from a plethora of causes as opposed to the increase in the summer, which is much easier to pinpoint.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/ijch.v61i4.17477&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;W. R. Keatinge&lt;/a&gt;, it is known that respiratory diseases are more common in the winter. This is because people tend to gather together inside to avoid the cold, which increases the chances for cross infection. On top of that it is also believed that winter temperatures cool the mucus in the upper respiratory tract. This essentially suppresses the immune system and makes it more difficult to fight infections. These two factors make death much more likely in the winter because people would be more vulnerable to a plethora of respiratory diseases and other diseases such as the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another explanation for why the death rates would increase in this time period, but it would only apply to the audience for The Egyptian Gazette because they are more likely to be English than other people in Egypt at the time. Accoridng to &lt;a href=&#34;https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/breaking-date-grim-reaper-people-sometimes-postpone-their-death&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mitsuru Shimizu and Brett Pelham&lt;/a&gt;, people can essentially postpone their deaths for one last holiday. In this case it would likely be Christmas or New Years, which is why this would only apply to the English-Egyptians because they are more likely to be Christians. The authors believe that this death deferral effect is that people make conscious decisions to survive for one last major holiday. While this explanation certainly contributes to the elevated death rate in the winter, the primary cause is likely to be increased disease due to a suppressed immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results make a decent amount of sense and are consistent with what can be observed today, it is worth keeping in mind that not all issues of The Egyptian Gazette have been accurately uploaded to the website. Also it is likely that these words appeared in areas besides where they are being reported. They would also be used multiple times in reports so the counts for death, murder, plague, suicide, and cholera won’t be completely accurate. With that said, these results are still useful for providing some insight into when death was most common in Alexandria, Egypt and what exactly caused this to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How did the British located in Egypt view the Ottoman Empire?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-anderson/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was common knowledge in the late 19th century and early 20th century that the Ottoman Empire was weak in comparison to its Western European counterparts. What was once a vast, threatening force that conquered the last remnants of the Roman Empire and spanned across Africa was now a kind of joke to the great European powers. After all, France and Britain had to aid the Ottomans in warding off Russia in the Crimean War (1853-1856), and Britain was de facto occupying Ottoman Egypt from 1882 until the Empire itself collapsed and beyond. These events were major blows to the image of this once feared empire, and they led to the idea that it was powerless. This is shown in the political cartoon: Tough on Turkey, which depicts Russia as a bear and England as a lion bullying the Ottoman Empire, which is portrayed as a turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

      Portrayal of the weakness of the Turkish Empire in comparison to early-modern Europe
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was the common interpretation of Turkey’s power in Britain, the British citizens that occupied Ottoman land would likely have a different relationship with the nation, being how they are in such close quarters with it. Thus, I look to find how the British living in Ottoman-controlled Egypt (practically in name only) viewed the Empire using the common phrases surrounding the word “Turks” within the Egyptian Gazette Digital Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I looked to find how many times the phrase “Turks” showed up in any feature. I did this primarily because it was the search query for the group project, but I figured that this could still be useful just to show the amount of times it was mentioned. Note, I did not choose the phrase “Ottoman” because the amount of advertisements for Ottoman banks or bonds was absolutely enormous. I will get back to that further in this essay. Going back to the query, I used the phrase &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;Turks&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated previously, this looked across all features of the newspaper that contained the word “Turks” within it. The “i” allows for the search to not be case sensitive. I plugged this query into the X-Path 2.0 feature in Oxygen to get fifty-eight (58) items throughout the contents. Here is a visualization of that spread, as done by Tableau:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-anderson/Turk-Visualization_huceb8b2b0cda0d3c2b273aef30bdbe0d6_44905_b54a96bbf6d70ad6ab31796ec6165f8f.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown here, the phrase “Turks” is not present in advertisements (at least not much) since it appears in the later pages of the Gazette whenever it shows up. This allows for interpretation surrounding the phrases, as the paper is not being paid to print in the interest of Ottoman businesses. It also spans across the period of 1905-1907, thus it is generally a common occurrence (for the phrase only being used fifty-eight times anyways). It also falls under a wide range of topics as well under the Feature legend. Suffice to say, the Turks were on the minds of the British in Egypt relatively consistently, but what exactly are their thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Egyptian Gazette, the answer is not entirely clear when querying these results. Much of the reporting on this topic is neutral, or at the very most just describing what the Turks did, or what happened to them, etc. One good example of this came from one of the earlier editions in 1905, in which it writes: “The Turks killed 30 Albanians in a fight near the town.” It has this but offers no opinion on it as it was just a story. Along with this, much of the way the text is written does not have much overarching ideas about the Turks. I found one example against that, but it is far and few between. This one writes about the Ottomans celebrating the anniversary of their Empire’s formation, with a royal prince discussing the “the sad situation in Turkey proper, owing to its bad government.” Overall, looking through this query one can find that the Turks (at least in that phraseology) is not discussed geo-politically much. However, there is more to this analysis. That being looking further into the phrase: “Ottoman”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, most of the mentions of the word “Ottoman” was found in advertisements. While there is the ability to eliminate advertisements in the query, many of them were listed as “items”, which eliminating those would make poor results. This could be seen as a limitation to this analysis, however, there is still information that could be taken from this issue. The fact that there are thousands of these advertisements shows that this Empire was important to the Brits in Egypt, otherwise there would not be so many of them if at all. One could make the argument that Ottoman business was seen as important to the occupiers. Therefore, through this lens I feel that the Ottomans/Turks were important to the British in Egypt overall, as they are in such close quarters with them that Ottoman business was a part of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do believe that the British in Alexandria did regard the Ottoman Empire as important, or at least more important than Londoners, because they were living on Turkish soil. Through some implicit analysis, I think that one could easily come to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Native vs. European Deaths</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-kryvorutsky/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-kryvorutsky/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my project, I decided to stem off my group project concept of deaths in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and focused solely on the comparison of Native Egyptian death reports versus European death reports throughout the newspaper.  I chose to investigate this topic because I thought it would be interesting to see the attitudes of the British towards the natives through death reports and compare those attitudes with those towards Europeans and other British people. I had a very minimal previous knowledge of tensions between the natives and the British, because of British colonialism in Egypt, but I wanted to learn more about it and see if these tensions were reflected in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I also wanted to compare the number of deaths reported for natives and Europeans, in hopes of seeing if there was a drastic difference within the number of deaths of each, or to see if there was bias in reporting deaths of either group when compared with real statistics of deaths in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I only focused on comparing the layout of native deaths and British/English deaths. I did this by completing 3 queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’native’,’i’))]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’british’,’i’))]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’)) and (matches(.,’english’,’i’))]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first query allowed me to find the headings of all divs that had both “death” and “native” in them, while the second and third allowed me to do the same while searching for “British” and “english” alongside “death”. I included both “english” and “British” in order to get as many relevant results as possible by using different ways of describing one group of people. I tried doing this with native deaths as well by searching “Egyptian”, but the majority of results were irrelevant since the word “Egyptian” comes up countless times throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my search of native deaths, I got around 180 results, while for the search of English/British deaths I got 150 results. I was able to visualize the data into 3 different charts. For the first chart, I made 2 separate bar graphs that showed the count of native and English deaths per month, quarter, and year. For the native death reports, a drastic majority occurred within the summer months, while for the English death reports, the death rate was highest in both the summer and winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second visualization I made was a tree map that highlighted the most commonly used headlines when reporting native and British deaths. Both charts showed “The Plague” headline to make up for most of the death reports, however native deaths had more than double the amount of plague death reports than British deaths. Furthermore, when looking at the general descriptions of headlines, it was obvious to me that the native death headlines were often much more gruesome and tragic than the British death headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015070450344&amp;amp;view=1up&amp;amp;seq=145&amp;amp;q1=alexandria&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Third Pandemic of Plague in Egypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights how Alexandria was a particularly easy city to get infected by the plague, because of its “crowded population, of middle class and poor people, living under bad housing conditions.” The plague had a case mortality rate of around 50% during the early 1900’s and every year had multiple cases of plague appearance between 1899-1930. This source also depicts which quarters in Alexandria had the most cases of plague, with Labban, one of the most infected areas, being inhabited by poor Egyptians and poor and middle-class Greeks, Maltese, and Italians. The least infected cities – Ramleh, Attarin, and Gomrok – contain modern European establishments and house the upper-class Alexandrians. This gives insight into why the plague was such a huge factor of deaths in Alexandria and why natives experienced a much greater number of deaths from the plague.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final visualization that I made from this search was a chart to show the frequency of death reports per page. I found that the charts for both nationalities were very similar, in that they both dramatically peaked at Page 3. However, my search for English death reports generated a lot more results in pages 4-7 than my search for native deaths did. I found this curious, but it makes sense since in the 8-page issues of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, the Army and Navy section often appears on page 4, which I would assume mostly consists of British soldiers. Additionally, the Local and General section along with the Native Press section would report on most native Egyptian deaths, which are both on page 3, and not many Egyptian deaths are reported outside that section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving deeper into the language associated with deaths in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to focus solely on the Local and General section, since I did not want any deaths outside of Egypt in my data set. Doing this, my estimate that there were more native deaths reported than European was once again reassured through seeing the results of my query. In order to find my results, I used the find and replace feature in Oxygen XML Editor, using regular expression to find &lt;code&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+ (?=[a-z, ]+dea[d,th])&lt;/code&gt;. I restricted this to the X-Path search: &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=“local”]&lt;/code&gt;, and got around 1300 results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer at my results, I found that most dates that showed up in the results had around 5 results, all in the same sentence, which inflated the search result amount by a great amount. The reason this happened was because this search located multiple words before “death” but only one word showed up in each search result, causing a large inflation of results. I tried troubleshooting this issue but resorted to keeping all the data and just relying on proportion in my final visualization rather than distinct count. I wanted to do a similar search with finding the words after death in the Local and General section, but after completing the search, I found that these results weren’t useful to me since they mostly just described how the deaths occurred, not who they occurred to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the procedure of using regular expression to clean up my results, then pasting the results into Excel, I then used a word counter to show me the frequency of keywords before “death”. Pasting this data into Tableau, I was able to make a visualization showing the greatest frequency of these words and I deleted the results that were irrelevant to my query.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With native deaths making up around 1/5th of the death reports in my results, it became obvious that there was a sharp difference in the number of deaths reported on native Egyptians versus the number of deaths reported on Europeans. Surprisingly, “British” or “English” were nowhere near the top keywords; rather Greek was the next largest notable nationality, followed by Sudanese at around half the number of cases as the former. This could be explained by the fact that Alexandria was occupied mostly by Egyptians, with around 18% of the population being composed of Europeans. According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www6.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/18.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cairo and Alexandria at the Beginning of the 20th Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the highest percentage of foreigners in Alexandria were Greeks at around 30%, then Italians at 15%, and Syrians at 14%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egyptian Death Reports</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-death-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-death-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our group decided to focus on death reports throughout the Digital &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Since this topic has already been thoroughly examined by other students in the past, we had to find something that would add new insight to how the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; reported upon deaths in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s. As a result, we decided to study the various components of life in Egypt that affected death and its subsequent presence in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as reports, articles, and expositions. We also researched how violent crime is reported in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to murder. Throughout various research methods, we discovered that death was one of the most prevalent topics of conversation in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death is something that is very often reported throughout the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, with multiple cases reported per day. Going through thousands of results for the words &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; would be a hard task in order to find trends and useful insight to how the British in Alexandria spoke on death in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s. However, we still started with a very broad query search to get a basic idea of the organization of death reports throughout the newspaper. We used X-Path to search for all the headings of &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s that contained the words “dead” and “death”, without paying attention to whether the words were uppercase or lowercase, by searching &lt;code&gt;//body/div/div[(matches(.,’dea[d,th]’,’i’))]/head&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave us a search result of 3458 items, which we then used regular expression in Sublime Text to just keep the dates, headings, and page numbers of our results. After this, we organized the results into excel, proceeding to use Tableau to create visualizations of Death Headings throughout the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. We were able to organize the data with a bar graph to show the frequency of death reports per month, quarter, and year. This gave us a basic idea of which seasons deaths occurred the most in, which could be significant in understanding life in Alexandria during the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this visualization, we clearly saw that deaths most often occurred in peak winter and summer months, with January 1906 having the greatest number of occurrences of death. According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xa8w9338b7yoyow/AADjpeAbqmqfe3_5PYE4dpdja?dl=0&amp;amp;preview=Judicial-adviser-1904.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Judicial Adviser Report&lt;/a&gt; from 1904 written by the British Judicial Adviser, death was most frequently caused by vengeance and cupidity. These months often lead to an increase in social interaction, which therefore caused an increase in feelings of greed and retribution. As a result, death sharply increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way we were able to visualize the data of all dead headings throughout the repository was by finding which headings death was most often reported under. We completed this by using a tree-map to show the most often used headings. Through this visualization, it was revealed that the “Local and General” heading was most often used by far; there were almost 300 results under this heading. The next largest headings were “Northern Italy,” “Personal and Social,” “Telegrams,” “Death,” “The Plague,” “Obituary,” and “Death”. This type of visualization was helpful in allowing us to identify the basic structure of where deaths are reported in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also investigated the features that most often featured the words “Death,” “Dead,” and “Died”. The X-Path query we used for this was &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’death’,’i’)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;, once again adding the “i” to ignore the case of the word, then changed the word inside the apostrophes to “dead” then “died”, going through every div to find the features that included these words. I did this in a slightly more tedious way that I could’ve done, but I got separate results for each word, which showed the frequency of the words in each feature. My results showed that the features “local,” “wire,” “social,” “birthDeathMarriage,” “obituary,” and “army” had the largest amount of death reports in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final visualization we made to help us understand the headings of death was a comparison between the count of death headings and the page number that they occurred on. This visualization showed us that death occurred on every single page, but was much more frequently reported on Page 3, which had 1,167 reports of death; around 10 times more than any other page. This makes sense since the 3rd page most often reports telegrams, local and general, and personal and social sections. These were some of the sections that had the most frequent reports of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this information about the layout of death reports in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted to find some additional insight to death reports that would help me understand more about the reports themselves, rather than just the layout of the reports. I figured that looking into the language used when describing these deaths would be very beneficial in broadening our understanding the way that the British in Egypt talked about death. In order to do this, I decided to use a simpler to find more words in the divs surrounding the word “death”. I did this by using the X-Path query &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=“section”]/div/p[contains(.,’death’)]&lt;/code&gt; to find the divs with the word “death” in them, which produced around 350 results, then followed the same procedure of using Sublime Text, and then using Excel to section the data into 2 columns of dates and words. However, instead of going straight to Tableau afterwards, I used the Online Word Counter linked in the resources tab of the Digital &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; page. After pasting all my results in, excluding the dates of each report, the word counter generated a list of the most frequent words used in my data. I then created another Excel sheet with only this information and connected it to Tableau, creating a bar graph visualization of the most frequently used words around the descriptions of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discarding the unimportant words, which mostly happened to be numbers such as “one” and “two”, along with some extra words that didn’t provide any insight into the language around death, I found that the visualization provided a good data set of words. Predictably, the top two most common words found were “death” and “deaths.” Nevertheless, looking further down the bar graph we found that the most frequent deaths involved topics such as hospitals, Alexandria, native, plague, Cairo, Egypt, fatal, treatment, and many other words. This proved to be incredibly insightful, as it not only allowed me to see the words used to describe death, but it also showed me which types of deaths were more frequent than others, or which the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, hospital deaths were by far the most frequent, with a frequency of 116. This may ironically be because of the improvements to the healthcare system in Egypt during the 19th century, which would cause more people to rely on the hospitals. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10015270/Aksakal.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Asakal and Hutt&lt;/a&gt; the “medical schools, hospitals, pharmacies, sanitation systems, and inspection regimes” are similar to the public health institutions and systems that are used in modern times as well. While the developments were ahead of their time, they had the problem of constantly being short of resources. This prevented the reforms from being good as they could have been. This improvement in the medical systems could have increased the confidence the public had in the medical systems, which would have increased the number of people that went to hospitals. The lack of resources would have made their treatment more difficult, resulting in a large proportion of deaths in Egypt being hospital deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that native deaths were very commonly reported, with a frequency of 107. This seems important since it could possibly show the contrasting conditions between native Egyptians lives and European lives in Alexandria. The plague was also a large factor of deaths reported, which most likely tie into the hospital deaths as well. The visualization revealed that the gender ratio of deaths was nearly the same; “woman” was used 29 times and “man” was used 28 times out of the death reports I gathered. This highlighted that there is not much bias or difference in frequency between the deaths of women versus deaths of men throughout the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going down the graph, the frequency of words slowly decreases, yet a lot of descriptive words such as “European,” “Greek,” and “murder” were used around 20 times each. This once again gives a better understanding of which types of deaths most often occurred or were reported on. There was a small amount of children deaths, with a frequency of 15, and many more descriptive words that had a frequency of around 10. The list of words goes down to a frequency of 2, but I only captured the top of the bar graph to capture the most important or most frequent language that surrounded death reports in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Government&#39;s role in wheat</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-rupkalvis/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-rupkalvis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government had a variety of programs to increase agriculture. One of the main crops they pushed was the production of wheat. It was a crop that was easy to multiply and produce mass amounts. One of the programs was the Cairo Agricultural show; this was an opportunity for the grower to show off their wheat production to potential buyers. It was a great networking event for both farmers and produce buyers. The best crop of the season had the opportunity to win cash prizes, in recognition of their large work. Another thing the government did was the Suez canal, which was a significant government transportation portal for the exporting of wheat. Great Britain exported most wheat, leaving little for the people “as little as 1/5 of the wheat was kept for the people” (The Egyptian Gazette). Of the 1/5 portion is reproduced into other products such as bread, etc. This action was done with a little more of a selfish nature of increasing economic revenue rather than helping the individual farmer. However, to make up for this selfish nature, the government would deal with the crime of people stealing each other’s crops and has taken these cases very seriously. These weren’t too common, but sometimes these cases even escalated to murder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, controversy began to grow about whether wheat or cotton was more profitable. The British saw wheat as mainly a single-dimensional product that was only for flour production. The thought instead, the big cash crop was cotton due to the greater demand during the civil war times and greater transferability. This is mentioned throughout the feature “British flour for Egypt” in the Egyptian Gazette. Although the British thought this, they still did a lot to help increase the production of wheat; in the Egyptian Gazette, the feature “abridged prospectus” explained the process of purchasing the land and how the process was meant to incentivize people to buy and start cultivating the wheat crop. The most popular land was lower Egypt which had the rich soil to grow good wheat. The process of securing land could get a little complicated, but there was a program to help poorer people get their foot in the door. Through this program, you could buy a share of land and make payments. However, if you miss only one payment, your entire land could be revoked. These payments could be expensive, especially with the hefty tax you pay to auditors. The auditors themselves were also noticeably know to be cruel and unfair, flaunting their power. This extreme policy and inconsiderate treatment really pressured farmers to produce most of the crops. This excessive production made local features such as “Khartoum’s wheat crop” describe wheat as a very profitable crop since it was written from the local perspective. Throughout the paper we find these contradictory articles of local’s vs British persuasion I can see thorough business features, world reposts, sometimes even personal articles people express show this tension is affecting the consciously or subconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These variety of government programs led to increase in the cultivation of the wheat crop but sacrificed the fair treatment of the farmers. The government created a hamster on the wheel type system. The focus was shifted from the people to instead focusing on forging perceptions and paying taxes overseas. However, due to the government distracted focus, the middlemen tax collectors were able to bend the rules and regulations as they saw fit. Therefore, creating the problem of bribery and illegal manipulation. These unfair systems and poor representation left the government in a negative light of the common people eyes. Throughout history we can see how distrust of the government often leads to riot and chaos. Thought the distrust in this government was common, it did run smooth enough to keep the people in check and the economy growing. This can be seen in the Egyptian gazette feature called &amp;ldquo;British Flour&amp;rdquo;. Throughout this text, they talk about the shift from wheat production to more cotton production due to its further profitability. The article details how as wheat increased, the demand and sales remained the same, and the primary consumers were the British Mill. The gazette Cereal tables exhibit that although foreign governments such as the British didn&amp;rsquo;t increase their wheat purchase during March of 1907, wheat remained at a sturdy price due to Egypt&amp;rsquo;s ability to distribute the extra grain elsewhere. This displays wheat&amp;rsquo;s ability to have stable and growing production and how it was an essential part of commerce, even though government support was shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How can microhistorical digital research methods apply to questions concerning qualitative data</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-qualitative-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-qualitative-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group is filled with many different questions with very few similarities between them all, however, after looking through what we were each using as a question and how we were researching we came to the conclusion that our group would best be summarized as one based around qualitative research. The question we decided to base our research on is how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression. The way to answer this question took us a long time to figure out due to how large of a question this is, we ended up having to collaborate and brainstorm many different ideas before coming up with a simple and effective solution. The solution we came up with to achieve this task was to create a general Xpath query that we could use in each of our individual projects and compare and contrast the data and information we got with this query. We all created visualizations based off of this Xpath query to make this goal more achievable. The question itself and the methodology used to solve were very useful for each of our individual projects, especially as many of our personal questions are complicated and difficult to answer.  With this group project question we can work on our own projects as a side effect of the group project question we are answering. In summary, we are a qualitative data group who are trying to answer how qualitative questions lead to the development of research techniques with xml and regular expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-a-query&#34;&gt;Finding a Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our group had many different topics, finding a common query seemed like a rather daunting task. Tying religion to military ranks to mummies, etc. looked to be somewhat impossible, especially considering how each individual project was specific in its own unique way. Thus, our query ended up being broad to fit the various objectives we had, which ended up being tied to our research methods (qualitative research). The query ended up being how many times a certain word that related to our project showed up across the entire Egyptian Gazette digital catalog, in any feature. We had mentions of the words: “Commander”, “Turks”, “Migration”, “Yours truly”, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression we ended up using was //div[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]/@feature, with “x” being the word we searched for. We put this into the XPath 2.0 search bar in the Oxygen Editor and queried the contents of the whole newspaper with our individual terms. Once the whole contents were queried, we copied over the results into a plain text editor, where we would edit it to be usable in an Excel spreadsheet. From there, we would copy it into Tableau, the application that visualizes the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the query worked shows how similar our data collection methods are. While the query itself is incredibly broad, it is a good representation of what we will do in our individual analysis projects. Specific searches would not work; thus, this method is likely the lowest common denominator that we have as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-visualizations&#34;&gt;Creating Visualizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our XPath query, we were searching for a few simple results in common for otherwise uncommon topics of study. Our query yielded the feature, date, and page number of every division that contained a keyword of our respective independent research efforts. With this data we sought to generate a set of visualizations that used the same type of data in roughly the same style and theme, to be easily compared to one another for possible similarities and discrepancies in the patterns of each, which could indicate a connection between the different topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use the date, feature count, page number, and feature for our visualizations. We formatted them in roughly the same manner, with a basic scatterplot styling. We placed the date variable along the x-axis and plotted the page number variable along the y-axis. The feature count data points are placed at each of their respective dates and page numbers, and then color coded each data point with its corresponding feature name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of visualization provides for a simplistic, understandable representation of our data. The matching formats and color coding allow for an easy way to compare our seemingly unrelated data just from glancing at each of the charts. Weaknesses of this visualization are that you cannot gather much just from these charts, only use them to infer about events that may have caused them to have patterns that coincide at the same time, leading to further investigation and research. While that is a glaring weakness, there is not much else to start out from researching, as the topics in question do not have much in common, so we must find similarities and differences before any reasoning can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-and-contrasting-our-visualizations&#34;&gt;Comparing and Contrasting Our Visualizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we completed our visualizations, we could embark on the analysis of our results. Since we each had such vast individual research topics, we were interested in comparing variables like page number, amount of data, the features that appeared most often, and the overall function our data would serve. Some proved to be more feasible than others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-page-number&#34;&gt;1. Page Number&lt;/h3&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-qualitative-group/Harrison_hu77d34e555ff2a7e53c3325820632cb87_65520_b903f6c061a9a1e8ff1d792764f144a6.webp&#34;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

As we completed our individual research, we realized that there is more variance than we originally expected. While our visualizations are fundamentally the same, they each present data differently. Since we all align under the scope of qualitative research, we expected most results to appear on page three of The Egyptian Gazette. However, our visualizations show that research relating to individuals (for example: &amp;ldquo;Commander&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Migration&amp;rdquo;) appears to spread across more pages than visualizations based on specific topics (for example: &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mummy&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

While comparing the visualizations, we also looked at the features where our data most appeared. It is difficult to identify exact results since the paper includes incomplete sections that do not have feature titles. This allows for easier navigation but does not show a complete picture. The features vary depending on the intentions of the research. The &amp;ldquo;yours truly&amp;rdquo; query appeared most in the Letters feature since it was specific to the Letter to the Editor section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. We ran the Xpath query to limit the search results to useful data rather than to identify the most common feature. This allowed for better quantitative data use during the research process. Contrastly, qualitative research attempts to discover which features discussed the topic. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Mummy&amp;rdquo; Xpath query revealed the most used features were Local and Egyptological. This led to more research questions and was used to understand the importance of mummies to the readers of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-data-spikes&#34;&gt;3. Data Spikes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

It was alluring to see when specific results spiked and dipped in results. However, when we attempted to draw links between rises and falls between visualizations, the results were inconclusive. In the Fall of 2006, the &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; visualization displayed an uptick in results. We attempted to research the reason and compare it to the uptick of results for the &amp;ldquo;Turks&amp;rdquo; visualization: to no avail. Since the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; files are incomplete, it is challenging to know if the spike is due to complete access to data or the paper&amp;rsquo;s coverage of the topic at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-strengths--weaknesses-in-microhistorical-qualitative-research&#34;&gt;Overall Strengths &amp;amp; Weaknesses In Microhistorical Qualitative Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the digital research methods we used with the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as our microhistorical source were complex and nuanced per each person&amp;rsquo;s research question; due to these complexities and nuances, various strengths and weaknesses arose during the employment of our chosen methods. A chief strength of our chosen XPath query and visualization format was their ability to encapsulate the significance of our search terms. The sheer quantity of results that our queries yielded provided us with adequate perceptions of how significant our chosen research topics were within the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, which is a useful starting point for the research process. Our chosen query and visualization also demonstrate the distribution of our search terms over multiple years of &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issues. The ability to ascertain any trends in the mentions of our search terms, such as if the term has a higher proportional frequency in certain months, is vital for the qualitative research we each embarked on. Our understanding of potential trends allowed for further research and analysis since we could consult secondary sources or more XPath query results to help explain these trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some weaknesses arose, though, from the confining nature of our chosen XPath query. Our query limited our results to only yield from &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; items labeled as features. Although this provided each of us with a smaller, much more manageable amount of data than a raw word count, it significantly limited the amount and types of trends we could analyze. Also, a weakness arises from the rather rudimental level of our chosen visualizations. Although these visualizations provided sufficient starting points for the research process, they did not yield enough data alone to be able to approach each of our complex qualitative research questions. This weakness, though, is merely reflective of the holistic qualitative research process. Qualitative research&amp;rsquo;s reliance on data beyond easily quantifiable characteristics meant we had to get creative to come up with numerical data for each of our projects. Many of us had to try multiple search terms that were relevant to our research topics before we even acquired enough data to transfer to a visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we feel that our chosen XPath query and visualization format effectively initiated our research processes and created a compelling concept to discuss as a group. The query and visualization format may not have been enough to answer our research questions by themselves, but they were helpful when accompanied by further research. We recommend utilizing similar digital methods to other qualitative researchers; however, we suggest limiting the XPath queries to multiple types of items within the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; rather than just features to see if another query yields a more desirable amount of results.  Overall, these digital methods are imperfect, but in their imperfections, they reflect the unique limits and challenges of microhistorical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Microhistory as a whole serves as an experimentational launching board between the realms of quantitative and qualitative analysis, and by nature our project was able to develop into an apt reflection of that reality. Within our project’s inquiry, we were faced with challenges beyond the scope of the dichotomy of using computational methodology to encompass qualitative data, specifically in that each specific personal topic was vastly different from the other. In the pursuit of trying to understand how to bridge these gaps, we developed a slightly broadened X-Path query, //div[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]/@feature, in order to encompass a similar objective within a common research method. It was through this we came to realize that within the confines of qualitative data, a good launching pad is looking at numerical counts of usage of “trigger words” along with location of said usage, and moreover supplies a unifying factor between distinct topics of qualitative research. In looking to display our data we opted for a scatterplot styling as it most aptly reflected the particular factors returned from our query: feature, date, feature count, and page number of every division that contained a keyword of our respective research efforts. This visualization was an easily understandable representation of our findings, and allowed for effectiveness in comparing various results across the independent research efforts. These differences highlighted certain vantage and null points for each individual project, and supplemented our notions as to where to continue looking for more specific information on our individual topics. In reflection, we realized that the query was able to encapsulate the significance of key terms while also serving as a helpful catalyst into more specialized research; however, while supplying us with a more workable set of data it limits the amount/type of trends we could analyze, and so you would need more queries in order to substantially supplement one’s research. Overall, the most profound lesson learned was the amount of work and research that could still be done in regards to computational research methods concerning qualitative data, and that it is necessary to go through multiple rounds of trial and error and experimentation in order to find more defined yet transferable methods of querying for qualitative data. Furthermore, it may be concluded that in the vast diversity within qualitative data that a “one-size-fits-all query” simply can not be overarchingly specific and yield consistent, detailed, and specialized results for each pursued topic. Ultimately, this project reflected the intricacies encompassed in the microhistorical digital research methodology in order to relate the surface level disconnect between qualitative information and computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sudden Death in 20th Century Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-beggs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-beggs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I began the research by searching for a correlation between illnesses and patent medicine advertisements. This led me to research the types of illness the medicine advertisements claimed to cure. The final question I decided to research is: whether illnesses mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; are comparable modern illnesses of the same name. I compiled a list of the most common diseases mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, but in the end, catarrh was the sickness about which I was most curious. The three companies I considered were Peruna, Allenburys’, and Dr. William’s Pink Pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peruna is a very familiar sight in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Overwhelmingly, Peruna promised to cure catarrh and consumption. Peruna referenced catarrh as a sickness, “Peruna is the best remedy for all catarrhal diseases. When the catarrh has become systemic, – that is, when it has been allowed to spread through the entire system, it is a difficult disease to cure” (“PE-RU-NA was successful where doctors failed”, June 26, 1906). By reading the quote from the newspaper, it is apparent that the authors of the advertisement thought of catarrh as a disease. Today, the term catarrh is not as prolific. Its meaning is also more ambiguous. The definition of catarrh according to Merriam-Webster is an “inflammation of a mucous membrane” (Catarrh). Peruna claims catarrh can be of the head, throat, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and pelvic organs. According to the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt; from 1859, the symptoms of catarrh are: grit in the eye, headache, impairment of smell, thirst, appetite loss, nausea, and abdominal pain (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/25193777&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, p.773). The Sudafed® website lists these symptoms of catarrh: runny nose, headache, face pains, feeling of mucus in the throat, “a reduced sense of smell and taste, temporary hearing loss and a crackling in [the] ear, and a sore, scratchy throat” (&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sudafed.co.uk/what-catarrh-and-how-get-rid-it&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What is Catarrh&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;). It is very difficult to find any information about catarrh in a modern sense. These two lists of symptoms are very similar. The main difference is the catarrh mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was much more extensive (affecting all mucous membranes in the body).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;catarrh&amp;rdquo; is mentioned 728 times in all the digitized copies of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Of the 728 mentions, only four of those mentions were not in advertisements (nearly all of these mentions came from Peruna advertisements but around three came from another patent medicine). One was a sad story about a man suffering from catarrh who committed suicide (not, according to the article, because of the catarrh). The other three mentions remarked about notable personages suffering from catarrh. It seems like the meaning of the disease catarrh changed through the century. Although the term catarrh is uncommon in this region of the world today, when used, it essentially means the same thing it did during the time of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some additional material that I found is lists of diseases within advertisements. While Peruna concentrated on sickness, Allenburys’ appears to be a company that concentrated on supplements or fortifying food, almost like vitamins today. Allenburys’ advertised itself as a restorative medicine, but also as a preventative diet. The most common version of the advertisement was the one summarized as the “Strength and Stamina” advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last patent medicine considered in this research is Dr. William’s Pink Pills. The most common ailment the Pills claimed to cure was rheumatism followed by anemia, indigestion, and sciatica. As seen in the image above, it seems almost random which disease the advertisement claims to cure each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used variations on the following XPath queries to find the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;peruna&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;]/div&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;catarrh&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)][not(@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;)]/p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These queries have problems because the unit &lt;code&gt;[not(@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt; is not always reliable. Sometimes a type is not used to define an advertisement. The other difficulty with this research topic is the lack of reliable information on historical illnesses. The reson I chose Peruna, Dr. William&amp;rsquo;s Pink Pills, and Allenburys&amp;rsquo; is they are the most common medicinal advertisements. This topic has many ways to expand upon the small amount of research I completed. Future research could expand upon each disease mentioned in the advertisements. Another idea for future research would be to compare treatment methods of the diseases to modern treatments. This research hardly covered any of the topic. There is much more to discover within the topic of 1900s illnesses and their treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the Cultural Significance of Mummies in Early 20th Century Egypt?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-oakley/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-oakley/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction--research-question&#34;&gt;Introduction &amp;amp; Research Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my learning in this course, the only Egyptological concept I was somewhat familiar with was that of the mummy. Mummies are the remains of humans or animals that have been preserved through specific ceremonial practices, such as removing internal organs and wrapping their bodies with bandages. Growing up in modern Western culture, I was exposed to mummies in museums, history textbooks, and countless movies, TV shows, and books. I never learned about them in-depth, though. Furthermore, they seemed to be exploited for their &amp;ldquo;creepy&amp;rdquo; factor rather than their cultural significance. Time and time again, I witnessed mummies portrayed as monsters instead of valuable cultural artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already faintly accustomed to this unfairness in the representation of Egyptian tradition, I was especially shocked when I realized that after encoding several issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I had not read a single mention of mummies. Based on the stereotypical portrayals of Egyptian culture in Western media, I expected plentiful discussions on mummies in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. This gap between stereotypical expectations and reality intrigued me; I instantly wanted to know more about mummies and their actual cultural significance beyond what American Hollywood films had led me to believe. With all this in mind, I decided to explore &amp;ldquo;What was the cultural significance of mummies in the early 20th century?&amp;rdquo; as my research question. I limited the scope of my findings to the early 20th century to better utilize our course&amp;rsquo;s repository of &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;queries--visualizations&#34;&gt;Queries &amp;amp; Visualizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my research with the following X-Path query:
&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;mummy&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with this relatively broad query to find which features had the most frequent mentions of the word &amp;ldquo;mummy,&amp;rdquo; or at least to find some sort of other noticeable trend in the word use that could help me narrow my research scope in further queries. Based on the results from this query, I created the following data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

               /post/2022-analysis-oakley/Story-1_hu0c4b9cde2d41f983e8b0381761303f67_83846_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-oakley/Story-1_hu0c4b9cde2d41f983e8b0381761303f67_83846_4479d45fbcaecfe9c592356015d3c1c1.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is evident in the graph, the query only yielded eleven issues with features that mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;mummy.&amp;rdquo; Based on this number, I inferred that many uses of the word probably occurred in segments of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; that were not labeled as features. Whether this was due to human entry error in our course repository or not, I could tell that this query alone was not fruitful enough to serve as the sole basis for my research. A helpful conclusion I could draw from the results of this query, though, was that mentions of &amp;ldquo;mummy&amp;rdquo; occurred at a proportionally higher rate amongst the results on page three of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issues. This finding was not what I initially had in mind when I used a query focused on features, but I was grateful to have a starting point for the next query. I refined my second query to only search for word mentions on the third page of &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issues to see whether this would bring me more results, specifically because this query was not limited to segments labeled as features. My goal was for this next set of results to provide me with a richer variety of information that could help me ultimately answer my research question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second, more niche query ended up looking like this:
&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][@n=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;]//div[matches(.,&#39;mummy&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to my delight, this query yielded thirty-seven articles that mentioned my search term. I created the bar graph below to help me visualize this data and spot any trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the visualized data above only portrays a proportion of total mentions of my search term because I confined the query to a specific page number rather than a raw word count. This proportional data, though, was immensely helpful in narrowing down the number of articles I could read that discussed mummies rather than just any &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; item that happened to use the word &amp;ldquo;mummy.&amp;rdquo; Thirty-seven articles were substantial enough to provide me with further insight into the cultural significance of mummies in Egypt at the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s time while still being a manageable amount of data. Overall, I was pleased with the results of my second XPath query and felt that it provided sufficient material to move from the exploratory to the analytical phase of my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my analysis by ascertaining trends in the visualized data above. I found that &amp;ldquo;mummy&amp;rdquo; was used the most in 1905 with sixteen mentions, followed by seven in 1906, then a spike to twelve in 1907, and ultimately only two in 1908. Although this data would suggest a drastic decrease in interest in mummy-related topics, I could not draw any significant conclusions from the lack of mentions in 1908 due to the fact that our course repository does not have many issues from that year in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I tried to focus on the months of the word mentions to see if there were any times of the year when mentions were most frequent. However, I was unsuccessful in determining any rhyme or reason to the word mentions. None of the months or overall seasons experienced a higher rate of mentions than others. Ultimately, the only trend I could conclude from my visualized data was the lack thereof; from an analytical standpoint, the use of the word &amp;ldquo;mummy&amp;rdquo; seemed random and did not follow any visible patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-interpretation--supplementary-research&#34;&gt;Data Interpretation &amp;amp; Supplementary Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I read the articles yielded by my second XPath query in my next phase of analysis, I quickly noticed that at this point in Egyptian history, mummies were more of a cultural spectacle for other countries than a sacred practice for native Egyptians to prepare for the afterlife, as they were in ancient times. Most of the articles discussed mummies in relation to museum exhibits or the projects of American Egyptologists. For instance, in the article &amp;ldquo;The Pharaoh of the Exodus,&amp;rdquo; from the 1905-12-26 &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issue, it was recorded that &amp;ldquo;A discovery of the utmost importance has just been made by the well-known American Egyptologist, Mr. Theodore M. Davis, who has discovered in the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, the tomb of Mer-en Ptah, a pharaoh of the 19th dynasty &amp;hellip; This pharaoh, who is also known as Meneptah, is thought by many to have been the pharaoh of the Exodus. His mummy was found in the tomb of Amenhotep II at Thebes.&amp;rdquo; I found this evidence of excavation work, and other articles like it, to be the most compelling because they demonstrated that the fascination with mummies during this time primarily came from foreigners rather than native Egyptians. Here is where I began to think that perhaps the mummy was more important to curious outsiders than the Egyptians themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interpretive conclusion grew as I read the remaining articles from my query. Many of them discussed European collectors of mummies, and one article entitled &amp;ldquo;Egyptian Mummies, No Fabrication&amp;rdquo; from the 1907-10-03 &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issue even divulged the easy accessibility of mummies: &amp;ldquo;Besides, the supply of mummies is practically inexhaustible and the price of an ordinary one is so low that a manufacturer in Paris could not box his mummy and send it to Cairo to be sold for the price that the genuine article can be bought at there, with its painted case and the certificate of the Cairo museum as to its genuineness.&amp;rdquo; Not only does the wide circulation and affordability of mummies in this newspaper excerpt point to their exploitation and spectacle nature, but the flippant tone of the writer suggests that mummies were not respected as culturally significant. The writer treated mummies as decorative commodities rather than artifacts of a practice that was sacred to ancient Egypt. Most of the articles fell under these larger categories of museums, exhibits, foreigners&amp;rsquo; excavations, or foreigners&amp;rsquo; mummy collections. The rest of the articles were random and largely insignificant, or sometimes redundant, such as the multiple articles referring to a sketch called &amp;ldquo;The Mummy and the Mummer,&amp;rdquo; written and performed by an Englishman. Even these seemingly unimportant articles further exemplify the fascination with and the spectacle nature of mummies in non-Egyptian cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had my preliminary conclusions formed from my research in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I consulted secondary sources to see if they would substantiate or refute my findings. After sifting through many academic articles, I found a consensus with my notion that mummies were largely valued in the early twentieth century purely as a cultural spectacle and a means to exploit and objectify Egyptian culture, primarily by Europeans and Americans. In the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/between-spectacle-and-science-margaret-murray-and-the-tomb-of-the-two-brothers/BD9BF4396C3C3AEE6CD594BAB2E5BA73&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Between Spectacle and Science: Margaret Murray and the Tomb of the Two Brothers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, it even discusses the popularity of mummy unwrappings in England at the early twentieth century. The article describes these public unwrappings as &amp;ldquo;public spectacles which displayed and objectified exotic artifacts&amp;rdquo; (Sheppard). Although the goals of some mummy unwrappings were rooted in scientific investigation, the vast majority of unwrappings served as entertainment, demonstrating a regard for mummies as culturally insignificant. In the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/184522&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unswathing the Mummy: Body, Knowledge, and Writing in Gautier’s Le Roman de la momie&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that this tradition of unwrapping mummies for public spectacle had spread throughout Europe, specifically in France. Curious as to when this trend in desecrating mummies for public interest began, I found an article called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/popular-exhibitions-science-and-showmanship-18401910/unwrapping-the-past-egyptian-mummies-on-show/F68462C54FA7D5FAC336412E3AB36F9E&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unwrapping the Past: Egyptian Mummies on Show&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that detailed an &amp;ldquo;incredible rise [in the 1820s] in the acquisition of Egyptian mummies for souvenirs and as artefacts for collection and display. [Mummies were] treated more as commodities and historical specimens than as human remains, they were displayed, unwrapped, cut open and divested of their funerary goods, all in the name of knowledge&amp;rdquo; (Rogers). This source effectively traces the sparked interest in mummies and their degradation at the hands of non-Egyptian collectors, historians, and scientists to the early 1800s. It became apparent to me that the treatment of mummies as insignificant objects within and beyond the borders of Egypt far predated the issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; that we examine in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate conclusion from my research in both the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and outside academic sources is that mummies in the early twentieth-century were culturally insignificant, or at least were treated as such. Mummies seemed to derive their value as spectacles and commodities rather than artifacts that still served a critical purpose to their native culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a weakness of my digital research methods in this project is that my microhistorical data only drew from a limited-perspective source: the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was written and published by the English forces occupying Egypt rather than native Egyptians. Ergo, coverage of mummies and related Egyptological topics came from a highly biased source. These topics most likely were not treated as culturally significant as they would have been if the newspaper were run by the native Egyptian population. Broadening my microhistorical data pool to include newspapers written by native Egyptians would have allowed me a more advanced analysis and overall stronger research conclusion. Given the microhistorical data I had to work with, my research conclusions more appropriately answer the question of how culturally significant mummies were to the English forces in early twentieth-century Egypt rather than their significance in general. This issue of bias in my microhistorical source is especially crucial since my research question deals with qualitative rather than quantitative data. I had to rely on the written content in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; to answer my sociological research question rather than numbers from the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s various tables and charts, which are not as directly impacted by the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s biases. Furthermore, the qualitative nature of my research question made finding numerical data to visualize for the project very difficult. I had to brainstorm which types of XPath queries would reveal data that would make sense or possibly lead to visible trends in a graph, which was complicated by my research question&amp;rsquo;s lack of adherence to any numerical concepts. If my research question was more inherently quantitative, I could have constructed more visually striking graphs that revealed more apparent trends in their data. Due to my research question&amp;rsquo;s reliance on qualitative over quantitative data, I found that much of the contextualization for the articles I yielded in my queries came from secondary sources rather than the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some weaknesses arose in my research from the limited scope of my microhistorical source and the lack of quantitative qualities in my research question, there were some strengths in the digital research methods I used. It may have been difficult to create data visualizations in my project; however, I think my ability to construct visual representations of the concepts I discussed made the data easier to follow for readers. Additionally, these visualizations helped me to form a fundamental understanding of my research topic before diving into my secondary research. Moreover, I think my ability to pull specific quotes from the broader microhistorical source for this project helped substantiate my research findings for myself and readers. Due to the qualitative nature of my research question, I could find quotes from the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; that were relevant to my research and helped me reach a compelling conclusion with demonstrative ethos for readers. All in all, my research process was imperfect, but I think I found a sufficient answer to my initial research question through the microhistorical digital methods I learned in this course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing importance in different wheat varieties in the Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-pazos/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although agriculture is important in every society, it proved especially important in Egyptian culture. With life almost being centered on the Nile, taking advantage of the annual flooding of the Nile was necessary. Around the 19th century, Muhammad ‘Ali focused on revitalizing farming infrastructure in order to build massive, high efficiency farming systems that could support entire cities with surplus being up for trade. (Johnson 2015) The plan was extremely successful and was then carried on by his successors, leading Egypt to gain an edge in the world of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in control over the Nile’s floods grew from being purely motivated by farming based income and towards influence in Sudan. (Johnson 2015) After utilization of a cleverly placed dam, access to land in Sudan allowed for further expansion of irrigation systems and farmland which in turn boosted agricultural output. Increasing Egyptian yield was not all positive however, due to constant soil usage, soil quality rapidly diminished and pest problems started to grow.  Despite agriculture providing a reasonable part of Egypt’s national income, there was a lack of well defined agricultural administration under the Cromer administration. (Johnson 2015) At this point more clear lines were drawn between the purpose of different crops with wheat being primarily for domestic consumption, and cotton being used as an export crop. Due to Egypt’s government being primarily British led, most agricultural policy was geared towards maximizing British income, meaning wheat farming took a backseat to cotton production meant for export. Due to wheat not being a “cash crop” in the same way cotton was, it didn’t continue to expand the same way cotton did as its purpose was mostly domestic. Despite all this however, Egyptians were extremely good at producing wheat, even being cited as being the best in the world at some point. (Gowayed 2009) Because of this, three wheat varieties were primarily grown: Tugari, Mawani, and Middling. Although information on these species of wheat is sparse beyond the context of Egyptian Gazette, what there is information on is prices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured above is the monthly average of the highs and lows of the three different wheat varieties. Although nothing specifically stands out at first, there are a few abnormalities in the seemingly normal chart. First and foremost, year after year, Mawani wheat consistently outperforms the other two wheat varieties. I did research into why this could be, and found that Mawani wheat was the variety that was often exported, while the other two varieties were more specifically seen as domestic crops meant to feed the population. On top of this, Mawani wheat was subject to price fixing at high costs in order to maximize export income. (Bureau of Statistics 1918) Because of these factors, domestic variants stayed more reasonably priced than the Mawani (Export) variant of wheat. The data is mostly consistent outside of this besides the Mawani variant from July to September. While the two other varieties often dip in that period, Mawani holds strong. I wasn’t able to find any sources directly speaking on it, (in the newspaper and online), but with the understanding the Mawani was an export variety, it would make sense that since wheat can be stored near indefinitely, wheat would be sold in a consistent manner month after month to maintain price by storing surplus in bountiful seasons. Further research into the issue reveals that in late 1907 a group of British soldiers went pigeon hunting, and a stray shot hit and set fire to a village’s wheat supply. From the chart, there is no way to determine whether it affected wheat prices, it does provide valuable insight into the flammability of wheat in Egypt either as a result of how it is stored and/or how climate affects said flammability, proving it to be a real risk worth considering when storing wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although wheat was always significant throughout the history of Egypt, it did end up taking a backseat to cotton entirely by the start of 1902 due to wheat simply just being unable to keep up economically. Cotton was storable throughout all seasons and demand shot up during winters, giving cotton farmers a target to aim for that wheat farmers simply didn’t have due to lower, more consistent demand over the course of the year. Although wheat and cotton aren’t necessarily competitive goods, as they both serve different purposes, they did compete for the same production space, forcing wheat out of the agricultural spotlight. Wheat suffered at times due to policy often specifically targeting cotton export growth, which hurt wheat due to cotton taking priority. To some degree, because cotton was the more profitable endeavor, this benefitted the wheat industry as it meant the Egyptian locals maintained control of their industry rather than it being entirely dictated by European leaders. The most impactful takeaway from this research is that although wheat fell away from being Egypts most popular crop, it still maintained a consistent purpose in providing domestically season after season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Promotions in the British Army of Occupation</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-bush/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-bush/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the British Empire landed troops in Egypt with backing from the Khedive, and defeated the Egyptian nationalist military. However, the army was not there to completely take over the territory as with other colonial military operations of the time period. Instead, the occupying force was simply there to ensure that the European economic interests remained secure in a region of great diversity and political instability, with competing interests from the many European colonial empires, the Ottoman Empire from the west, and the native Egyptians. The nation of Egypt was left to be partially autonomous, but the Army of Occupation would remain to keep British interests safe and ensure that Britain&amp;rsquo;s hold over the government would stay strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research seeks to analyze the promotions within this Army of Occupation, as the British military was a substantial part of the daily lives of the Egyptians under imperial subjugation, and the promotions within their ranks were the most commonly reoccuring feature in the Egyptian Gazette that pertains to this topic, and I took a research interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my initial stages of research, I used simple XPath queries to get a grasp on the basic data I would be working with. I wished to try to see if a pattern could be found, or if any of the initial data stood out for a path for my research to hone in on. I began with queries related to keywords, such as specific ranks and promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;colonel&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;colonel&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;corporal&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;corporal&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;lieutenant&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;lieutenant&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;promoted&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;promoted&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to have the headings yielded so I could easily see the main topic of each division, and I would be able to tell easily if an article was unrelated to my research and exclude it before compiling data. I chose to do a secondary query of each yielding the features, so that I could see from a broad perspective how clean my data was. If most of my features had to do with the military or government, I knew that the data was an accurate representation of what my research was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed a pattern in the months that the rank &amp;ldquo;colonel&amp;rdquo; appeared, and saw that it most often was mentioned in certain months, peaking in October with 14 mentions, then sloping off until rising again in January to 13 mentions, then decreasing again before jumping up to 12 mentions in June, then sloping off and the cycle begins again. This would indicate that military presence in the news is concentrated within certain times of the year, and thus military promotions would be expected to peak in the same time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished to test this theory and narrowed my search to mentions of the words &amp;ldquo;promotion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;promoted&amp;rdquo; within divisions containing the rank of &amp;ldquo;Lieutenant&amp;rdquo;. Sure enough, mentions peaked in the same periods of time. This confirmed that promotions tended to be awarded to military officers during specific months, and then become less and less frequent until the next peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the concentration of military promotions in the army of occupation around these months is due to British army traditions centered around the same time periods. In my research I discovered that the honors, awards, and promotions to officers in the Royal Army were announced in The Gazette, the official public record of the United Kingdom, twice a year. The Gazette reports that after a Royal decree, &amp;ldquo;With these regular awards came the institution of the Birthday and New Year honours lists, published as supplements to The Gazette. Honours are published in The Gazette twice a year - between May and June on the Queen&amp;rsquo;s official birthday, and at the New Year&amp;rdquo;. This explains why the promotions would peak in January and June, as they do in the  Egyptian Gazette, as the British heirarchy would be incentivized to give out their intended promotions before they are announced and archived back in London. Also, an extremely popular military parade falls annually in mid-June, known as &amp;ldquo;Trooping the Colour&amp;rdquo;, and it would make sense for promotions to be given around this event, as many senior officers and members of the royal family are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“National and Personal Achievements: Military and CI&amp;hellip;” The Gazette, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/national-record-of-achievement&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/national-record-of-achievement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Export of Wheat through the Sahel over Time</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-grove/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-grove/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;X-Query: &lt;code&gt;//head[contains(.,&#39;Cereals in Boat at Sahel&#39;)]/following-sibling::row[1]/cell[3]/measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my individual research project, I decided to look at the weekly export of wheat from Sahel. Sahel is another term used to describe the north coast of Egypt, where the majority of their exports flow through into the Mediterranean. I tracked the exports from the beginning of 1905 to the beginning of 1908, and found some commonalities between the years. The peak of exports seems to be from January to mid-March. This is because the Nile flooded in mid-September, spreading sediment and other nutrients into the farmland that allowed the farmers to grow crops. Wheat tends to take 120-140 days to fully mature, so the wheat would be ready for harvest in the January-February time frame. However, the British started building dams and water resources in 1902 to try and make the farming season year round by providing a consistent source of water. However, the initial Aswan dam was not capable of storing or providing enough water to provide any sustainable amount of farming water so the yearly flood cycle was still the main source of gaining nutrients for farming and providing water for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the graph the exports in early 1906 are unrivaled, with a weekly peak at over 120k ardebs. However, the weeks prior to that week are underwhelming compared to other years, so I believe that something limited exports during those times and that caused the week after whatever event to have hyperinflated export numbers. Compared to 1906, 1907 has much lower export numbers. This can be tied to the Denshawai Incident, where a flare up of violence between Egyptian villagers and British soldiers led to more of the Egyptian population turning to nationalism and seeing cooperation with the British as not possible. This translates into farmers being less willing to export large sums of wheat, and instead keeping and selling it within the country or to export it in other ways that do not go to European countries, therefore not going by boat through the North of Egypt. The middle part of 1906, where a straight line is present, is a portion where either no newspapers have been uploaded or they do not have export charts with them. I cannot find any outside resources to help give any insight into what the export numbers may have looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culturally and historically wheat has been extremely important to the Egyptian way of life. The Ancient Egyptians would farm and sustain themselves off wheat, and mastered farming it. They understood the Nile’s flooding cycle, irrigation, and storage amongst all the other things. This major emphasis however has made Egypt the eye of many large empires. Originally, the Romans took over Egypt and used it to feed their Empire. The Romans saw Egypt as so important that they allowed them to continue having a Pharaoh to try and maintain the peace in order to milk grain out to feed Rome. This is no different than Muhammad Ali Pasha, who modernized Egypt to become a massive cotton producer. However, Egypt could not produce cotton 24/7, so they also grew wheat in the cotton off-season, and lived and sold this wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, through my research and the analysis of my quantitative data, I gained a stronger understanding of not only the export and farming patterns of Egypt in the early 20th century, but also the cultural effect of the production of wheat throughout Egyptian history into the modern times. The introduction of water reservoirs and dams, such as the creation of development of the Suez Canal and Aswan Dam amongst other water conservation and distribution sources, has had a massive effect on the growing capabilities of Egypt, as well as the amount of work farmers have to do. The average farmer in the 1900’s had to work year round, compared to pre-colonization workers that only worked one cycle as they had work for sustainment opposed to profit. The introduction of cotton farming as a profit driven business also led to workers having to work more, and work harder. This led to Egypt decreasing their wheat production in favor of growing and selling raw cotton to processing mills throughout Europe and using the profit to prop up their economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentions of Disease in the Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-disease-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-disease-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question our group sought to answer was how the number of mentions of diseases in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; differs according to when they were discovered. We analyzed the frequency at which 14 different diseases were mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; from January 1905 to December 1907 and compared the results to how recently the disease had been discovered for the people in this time. In order to collect the data on how often specific illnesses were referenced, our group employed the use of both target word searches in the content repository as well as tailored XPath queries. The queries focused on finding mentions of the different diseases. We accounted for spelling differences such as with smallpox by performing multiple queries per disease when necessary (ex. “smallpox” and “small pox”). These word searches produced an information set that revealed mentions by month of Pneumonia, Epilepsy, Smallpox, Yellow fever, Aneurysm, Heart disease, Stroke, Cholera, Bilharzia, Enteritis, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, and Influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the plague, we used the XPath &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;plague&#39; ,&#39;i&#39;)]/*[not(matches(.,&#39;cattle&#39;))]/*[not(matches(.,&#39;locust&#39;))]/head&lt;/code&gt;. This specific XPath is designed to find how often Headlines containing the word “plague” are found in the Egyptian Gazette. Not only that, but because we are looking for Sapien incidents, the XPath excluded instances where cattle or locusts were addressed in conjunction with “plague”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we chose the diseases mentioned in this analysis project is because of their application to our projects. However, we also primarily focused our attention on more commonly known diseases of the time, such as plague, cholera, and tuberculosis. We also included data on illnesses like stroke and heart disease in conjunction with contagious diseases. Furthermore, we considered epilepsy as a potential data point but discovered that the newspaper only mentioned it twice. Therefore, our work is not comprehensive of all diseases mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, but it attempts to cover a variety of common and uncommon diseases occurring during that era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the data on each disease was collected, it was organized into a list of dates detailing when they were mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette. The data was then separated by month and placed into two bar charts to visualize our findings. One reveals how many mentions there are of the individual diseases each month and separates the findings by color for comparative clarity. The second chart shows the total count of “new diseases” compared to “old diseases” from 1905 to 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this analysis, “new diseases” are considered anything discovered within the last century of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; articles being written. “Old diseases” on the other hand are the remaining illnesses, chronic or acute, claimed to have been discovered before the 19th century. This classification system was created to be based on how the readers and authors of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; would have thought of the diseases. While we today may think of diseases like tuberculosis and typhoid as old since they are no longer common, it is important to remember that they were relatively new for the time period in which the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was written.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, several of the diseases we are analyzing have documentation dating back to a thousand years or more before the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was written. For clarity purposes, the first &amp;ldquo;documentation&amp;rdquo; of a disease is defined as the first time it was mentioned in recorded history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hippocrates recorded the symptoms of a &lt;strong&gt;stroke&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt; during his lifetime, which was from 460-370 BC (Nilsen and Imogen).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aneurysm&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;smallpox&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;plague&lt;/strong&gt; were discovered between 100 AD and 600 AD in the order listed (Livesay, “History of Smallpox”, and “plague”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first record of &lt;strong&gt;influenza&lt;/strong&gt; was an epidemic in 1173 AD and &lt;strong&gt;yellow fever&lt;/strong&gt; began in the Americas during the 1500s (Shimizu and “yellow fever”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The origin of the concept of &lt;strong&gt;heart disease&lt;/strong&gt; is a bit vague, but in 1768, a speech was given about coronary artery disease (“History of Heart Attack”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholera&lt;/strong&gt; also has an obscure history because reports of a disease with similar symptoms existed in India thousands of years before the first documentation of it in 1817 (“cholera”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1851, Bilharz found the cause of &lt;strong&gt;bilharzia&lt;/strong&gt; (parasitic worms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few years later in 1880, the source of &lt;strong&gt;typhoid&lt;/strong&gt; was discovered (specific bacteria) (Barakat and Marinelli).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/strong&gt; was discovered by Dr. Robert Koch in 1854 when he first isolated the bacteria which causes it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enteritis&lt;/strong&gt; was the most recently classified disease (1850-1900) discussed in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; (Kirsner).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all these reports, unfortunately, sometimes this date is vague and uncertain, and often information about the disease was verbally imparted to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data reveals that the most commonly mentioned disease was the Plague, with the second most common being cholera. One reason this could be the case is that there may have been more cases of the Plague than Cholera in Alexandria between 1905 and 1907. However, it is important to note that Europe was recovering from a major outbreak of the Plague in 1899, in which 250 cases were recorded. For perspective, this number dropped to less than 20 by 1903. Most of the cases were recorded in coastal and inland port cities such as London, Liverpool, and Marseille. Because Alexandria is a major port city with heavy traffic between these areas, it is likely they would have been concerned with outbreaks in their own city, especially in the wake of a major European pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mentions of the plague were so prolific, we only included mentions featured in headlines; whereas, for every other disease, we counted the total mentions. Despite these measures, plague still outranked all other diseases at 259 mentions. The disease referenced the second most was cholera at 236 mentions. Furthermore, the diseases mentioned the least were aneurysms (2) and bilharzia (4). Both of these diseases were not featured regularly in the Gazette, potentially due to them being either very rare or so common that they don’t require reporting. Overall, diseases classified as “old” (482 times) were mentioned more than diseases classified as “modern” (304 times), but this figure includes plague, which could be considered an outlier due to its prevalence. When the numbers are analyzed without plague, modern diseases are mentioned more (304 times) compared to old diseases (114 times).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for most of the diseases, there were no predictable or seasonal trends. The plague was an exception to this rule and experienced an increase in mentions during the summer months. The fluctuation could be the result of conflicting attitudes toward quarantine practices, or the product of preexisting outbreak fears that increased during the summer and fall months. Another explanation is that case numbers did actually increase during these months despite anecdotal and historical claims to the contrary. The data itself could also be flawed and not accurately reflect the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;’s true contents. For the other diseases, the lack of a pattern could be due to many elements. This study examines the mentions of disease, not the actual case numbers, so the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; could have not mentioned cases for a variety of reasons. Cholera, on the other hand, remained fairly consistent and level in its number of mentions, but there were 2 spikes in the data that serve as staggering outliers. These spikes occurred in September 1905 and January 1908. Cholera is transmitted through contaminated food or water, so, in a time when sanitation was lacking, it was a very transmissible disease. As a result, a possible reason for the spikes could be cholera outbreaks. Further investigation into the articles where the mentions are found confirms this theory, with both spikes being caused by increased reporting on widespread outbreaks. This finding also creates the idea that perhaps the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; prefers to report on large disease clusters and not individual cases, adding another layer to why certain diseases are mentioned less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the data chart shows that the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; mentioned old diseases more often than new ones. There are many potential theories for why this is the case. First, modern diseases were much less known among the public. Many of the “old” diseases had been identifiable for centuries, so it makes sense that they were recognized by the population sufficiently enough to get reported on by the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Modern diseases might have been equally prevalent among the populations, but if they were not known formally by most of the population, their numbers would have been difficult to report. Additionally, the category of &amp;ldquo;old diseases&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; includes the plague, which is the most commonly mentioned disease. If plague were to be excluded from the data as an outlier, modern diseases would be mentioned more than old diseases. A possible reason for this is that many of the modern diseases were highly contagious, such as cholera and influenza. Since these diseases lend themselves to outbreaks, it makes sense that they would be mentioned more than others. As the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic has revealed, outbreaks have the potential to get a lot of media attention. Another theory for the prevalence of modern diseases is precisely because they are &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo;. While the relatively recent discovery of these diseases would result in them being less recognized, it could also prompt the Gazette to mention them more frequently to alert, educate, or attract curious readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, many factors could have influenced the data reflected in our initial query, and there is no definitive way to isolate one, if any, as the true cause. Still, further research on this project could include analyzing the changes and trends in how the media discusses diseases over the next century. By expanding the data set, an explanation might emerge as the most likely for the discrepancies. As &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; diseases become “old” and as scientific understandings of illnesses increase, one could explore how news organizations choose to talk about diseases, and what the influencing factors of this type of media content are. Are they similar to the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in 1905, or do they reveal a greater shift in public perceptions of chronic and acute diseases?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plague Mentions in the Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-damato/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In preparing for my analysis project, I ran the XPath Query: &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;plague&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/*[not(matches(.,&#39;cattle&#39;))]/*[not(matches(.,&#39;locust&#39;))]/head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specific XPath is designed to find how often headlines containing the word “plague&amp;quot; are found in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Not only that, but because I am looking for sapient incidents, the XPath excluded instances where cattle or locusts were mentioned in conjunction with “plague”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XPath, along with the word search, produced results that revealed an annual spike in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s mentions of the term plague along with repeated occurrences of the influx from 1905-1906. As illustrated in the chart below, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; contains headlines with the word &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo; almost twice as many times between early summer to early fall months compared to in the winter and spring. Curious to see if there were any correlations to explain this phenomenon, I conducted a simple word search through the content repository to find how many times &amp;ldquo;disease” was mentioned in the newspaper. Because of the extensive use of this term, my query yielded significantly more results than when looking for plague headlines. However, the mentions of disease seemed to follow a similar pattern to those of the plague. While it is not as dramatic of a fluctuation, the subtle increase and decrease in the references to disease seem to correspond with the plague&amp;rsquo;s annual influx. This phenomenon led me to wonder: Why are there significantly more occurrences of the word “plague” being mentioned in one part of the year than in the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are challenges with answering this question. For one, not a lot of information is given on the Plague in Egypt between 1905-1907, and most data on disease cases refer to European and American studies. Furthermore, a wide range of factors potentially explains why the Plague was talked about more during one half of the year than the other. Public perceptions, case numbers, weather, or even shipping movements could all contribute to the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s decision to increase or decrease their mentions of the Plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the importance of these mentions in an Alexandrian newspaper, one must first understand the context of the term &amp;ldquo;plague.&amp;rdquo; In the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, the term “plague” is often synonymous with “Bubonic Plague”. The bubonic plague is caused by a highly infectious bacterium called Yersinia Pestis. This disease, normally transmitted by fleas on rats, causes fever-like symptoms in victims that can escalate to swollen and painful lymph nodes and even death. Throughout history, there have been several instances when plague epidemics have erupted, most infamously being the Black Death in 1346–1353.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, 92.9% of the mentions of the Plague were on page three of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I found this information by applying the XPath &lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;disease&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; to find the date, page, and section identifier for every occurrence of the word plague in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. This abundance of mentions on page three is because 329 of the 380 mentions of the Plague (not just headlines), between January 1905 and January 1908, were found in the “Local and General” section of the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is relevant because page three is typically the first page in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; that does not primarily contain advertisements. Therefore, if a reader wanted non-advertised information, they would likely turn to page three first. Furthermore, the &amp;ldquo;Local and General&amp;rdquo; section of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is normally the first column on page three. Therefore, these contents are placed optimally to be most noticed and read by the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s subscribers. Even more, plague information would have been highly relevant to the people of Alexandria due to the risk associated with diseases in major cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research article published by The Royal Society illustrates European case numbers of the plague during the early 20th century. Their findings support the idea of plague epidemics being pervasive in highly populated regions such as coastal or inland port cities. The data revealed Europe was recovering from a major outbreak of the Plague in 1899, in which 250 cases were recorded. However, this number dropped to less than 20 by 1903. Most of the cases were recorded in coastal and inland port cities such as London, Liverpool, and Marseille. Since Alexandria is also a major port city with heavy traffic between these sites, Egypt would likely have been concerned with outbreaks in its own cities, especially in the wake of a major European Pandemic. Furthermore, cities such as London and Liverpool are listed in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as frequent areas of “special outside dispatches” under the Exterieur section of the Newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite concerns over plague outbreaks, European case numbers were significantly low between 1902 and 1909. While there was a drastic case spike in 1899, the years that I am analyzing (1904-1907) reportedly witnessed a recession in case numbers. This statistic could imply that cases mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; would be more likely identified as anomalies than common occurrences. Furthermore, because Europe was recovering from a major outbreak only a few years prior, and Alexandria had close international ties with the European community, any cases in heavily populated areas would have been concerning to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in 30 separate instances, 10% of the plague headlined occurrences, &amp;ldquo;quarantine&amp;rdquo; was also mentioned. While quarantining was a heavily enforced precaution taken during this time, it had a controversial history. After a series of deadly plagues hit Alexandria in the early 1800s, increased quarantine regulations were set in place to prevent future spreads. However, this action faced significant opposition from merchants and Muslim Egyptians who felt their ways of life were being threatened. Merchants were worried about how the policies would affect trade, while Muslims were disturbed by the quarantine&amp;rsquo;s violations against Islamic law. Not only that, but many Egyptians feared being removed from their homes and sent into isolation if they were found to have the Plague. Unfortunately, the region experienced several more epidemics throughout the mid-19th century, up until 1844. After that, the plague mysteriously disappeared for almost 55 years, likely a testament to the heavily enforced sanitary and quarantine standards which were implemented well into the 20th century. For example, an entry from September 1905 states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only one fresh case of plague occurred in Egypt throughout last week, namely at Alexandria, and all other places are declared free. Three Europeans recovered during this period and there were two deaths, and one fresh case, an Italian grocer in the Menshieh district was notified yesterday. There are now only two cases under treatment. The total number of cases from January 1 to date amounts to 258, as compared with 804 during the corresponding period of last year. In consequence of the notification of a fresh case at Alexandria, the quarantine measures against departures from this port have been re-established”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague’s highly contagious nature, along with its history in Europe and Alexandria, encouraged the implementation of isolation and quarantine practices. While the connection between the Plague and quarantine does not directly explain the reasons for increased mentions of the disease in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, it does give insight into how the public perceived the Plague and the measures that were taken to combat it. Furthermore, despite conflicting attitudes on the practice throughout the 19th century, quarantining was, overall, believed to be an effective strategy in fighting outbreaks and would have reassured readers that necessary action was taking place to ensure their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, amid the 19th-century pandemics, many European residents in Egypt believed that plague season had “easily defined limits” according to the historian &lt;a href=&#34;https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5t1nb3mq&amp;amp;chunk.id=d0e1179&amp;amp;toc.depth=1&amp;amp;toc.id=d0e1179&amp;amp;brand=ucpress&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LaVerne Kuhnke&lt;/a&gt;. But rather than expecting cases to increase in the summer months, as the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; data would suggest, Egyptians witnessed a decline in plague cases starting in June. They even celebrated the plague&amp;rsquo;s disappearance alongside &amp;ldquo;al-Nuqta&amp;rdquo;, their annual summer celebration of the rise of the Nile River. Egyptians also participated in festivities on St. John’s Day (June 26) to acknowledge their escape from the Plague&amp;rsquo;s last arrival. Some European travelers even noted that it was “well known that extreme heat checks the plague in the same manner as the cold season.&amp;rdquo; This discovery seems to run contrary to the information on the plague found in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Even though mentions of the Plague are not indicative of actual case numbers, if heat and extreme temperatures deterred the disease, then it would be expected that mentions would decline during the hotter months. Instead, we see a rise in the number of mentions of the plague between May and September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are many potential reasons the word “plague” was talked about in different amounts throughout the years. For example, the fluctuation could be the result of conflicting attitudes toward quarantine practices, or it could be the product of preexisting outbreak fears that increased during the Summer and Fall months. Another explanation is that case numbers did actually increase during these months despite anecdotal and historical claims to the contrary. The data itself could also be flawed and not accurately reflect the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;’s true contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, many factors could have influenced the data reflected in my initial query, and there is no definitive way to isolate one, if any, as the true cause. Still, despite the inconclusiveness of my results, a greater picture of the plague in 19th-20th century Egypt and its impact on the public was revealed through this analysis. Each mention of the plague is the product of a long and complicated history of epidemics experienced by Egyptians and Europeans. These findings could inspire further research into how the Plague was portrayed in media at the time, such as in newspapers and journals, and how it has evolved over the next century because of scientific and intellectual advancements and shifted perceptions on acute diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of The Letter to the Editor Section of The Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-sharrow/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-sharrow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-and-research-question&#34;&gt;Introduction and Research Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began the research process, I was fascinated by the passion behind the Letters to the Editor Section. There were vile arguments about political views, people contradicting articles previously published, people offering a unique perspective, and people professing their undying support. This variety left me with many questions. After a difficult research process, I am setting out to answer a complicated question: What is the purpose of the letters to the editor section in the Egyptian Gazette? The answer combines qualitative and quantitative research to tackle this question from the perspective of the newspaper and the writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;queries-and-visualizations&#34;&gt;Queries and Visualizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question changed a lot over the course of the process. I initially pursued the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s opinion of the letter to the editor section, but that led to vague, unquantifiable results. So I endeavored to gather why the newspaper published the letters and why people wrote the letters. My original jumping off point was to find out what was discussed in the Letters to the Editor section. I started with the following Xpath query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;]//head&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pulled the headling of every Letter to the Editor feature that was in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I then copied and pasted the contents of every section in 1904 into a word cloud generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-sharrow/wordcloud_huead3e308af8970a7ab3122127b8b701c_423333_28c79312b21505430cd38fcda69f6f7d.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I understood a little bit about what was generally talked about in this feature, I looked at the relationship between the date a letter was submitted to the paper and the turnover until it was published. I sought to identify the opposition or support of the newspaper, then compare the delay time between the two. Would it take shorter or longer for a positive letter to get published than a negative letter? What does that mean about the intentions of the newspaper? I set out to find my answer. I searched for the Xpath query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;]//dateline &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query scans the Egyptian Gazette repository and looks for the dateline within every section of the Letters to the Editor feature. The query drew 122 results, and I could begin the tedious reading process. I had to identify opposition and support. As I read, I created an identification system and labeled each position behind the letter as a complaint, support, or expert. I labeled these based on the tone, style, and material the letter covered. The more I read, the more I realized it might have been more effective to identify the topic that the letter covered (ex. politics, sports, socioeconomics, asking questions, complaining about public facilities, reporting concerning incidents). If I had categorized data by content, I could have found more results regarding the purpose of the letters section. Instead, I used position labels, dates of release, and the date of the letter. This allowed me to produce an initial visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               /post/2022-analysis-sharrow/Visualization_hu3b80b2eb9942bc5a6f68a202d5649ada_241302_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;

               width=&#34;760&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ecstatic to see the upward trends, but I wanted more than what this visualization presented. I saw each position but wanted to complete a deeper comparison to see if there were any trends I was missing. I went back to the data and added a column for the delay (in days) between the date the letters were written and published. This numerical measure added complexity to the graph and allowed me to compare each position&amp;rsquo;s submission date more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visualization shows trends in release dates of the Letters to the Editor section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The graph on top shows the date the letter was written and the date it was released for each position. The graphs overlaps, so the positions that skew low or high are observable. The lower graph depicts each letter, whether it supports, complains, or is an expert, and the time in days between writing and publishing that letter. This allows me to delve deeper into my quantitative research and make conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interpreting-data-and-supplementary-information&#34;&gt;Interpreting Data and Supplementary Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this complete visualization, I began using this quantitative data to explain the purpose of the letters to the editor section for the newspaper. The bottom graph of my finalized visualization is very sprawling. The data seems inconclusive; however, the letters that offer an expert opinion have less universalized delay times. The results vary from 0 to 33 days. This is more sprawling than any support or complaint of the paper. Since many expert opinions were less time sensitive and referenced their unique perspective, it was slower to publish for the newspaper. I expected a big difference between the delay times of support and complaints. I thought the newspaper would want more positive feedback rather than negative feedback included in the paper. The results showed more complaints than supportive letters, and the two positions overlapped in delay times. There were no conclusive results about the turnover from being written to published. This surprised me, and I did some qualitative research to understand how this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read the letters to the editor section, I noticed the overwhelming quantity of letters and activity surrounding any controversial topic. In June of 1907, a letter featured an extremely &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-roche/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;angry horse-race goer&lt;/a&gt;. For the entire month, people weighed in with their opinions on the matter. It got insanely vile with these oppositions, and I was surprised the newspaper would want to include this fighting. Then, after looking at the graph, I saw a spike in the number of letters in June of 1907. Similar results occurred with each discussed contentious topic. Having controversial and &amp;ldquo;negative&amp;rdquo; letters published, led to an uptick in viewer participation for the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. This explains why the newspaper would want to publish viewer opinions. It gives people a say in the newspaper and promotes more viewership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious about this trend and wondered if this was specific to the Egyptian Gazette or common across other newspapers. I did some research, and according to&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=T-EwAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA3&amp;amp;dq=letters&amp;#43;to&amp;#43;the&amp;#43;editor&amp;#43;1907&amp;#43;egypt&amp;amp;ots=U3QqYthksz&amp;amp;sig=JJsgqyU7uE6vzIUk4DbAgyynjIs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=letters%20to%20the%20editor%201907%20egypt&amp;amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Blunt and the &amp;ldquo;Times&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, (a book about the Times magazine in Egyptian affairs published in 1907), the letters to the editor section has engaged audiences for many years. It is interesting to see how this compares with my findings and adds complexity to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Letters to the Editor section, a seemingly passive addition to the paper, has a lot of meaning for the readers that increase involvement and the newspaper that increases viewership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;difficulties-faced&#34;&gt;Difficulties Faced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research process was not without its difficulties. Working with an incomplete data set means I have skewed results. Without that information, I am missing out on possible abnormalities that could lead to more research questions and deeper complexity. Another challenge throughout this process has been a changing understanding of the meaning of the section. Initially, I thought the letter to the editor section was a place for viewers to oppose and support the paper. The more I read, the deeper I understood that it was a place for viewers to challenge and question each other. This deeper understanding made it difficult to answer my original question. I had to generalize my findings to answer a workable research question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tableau and OxygenXML also proved to be challenging. The Xpath query and visualization took a lot of tweaking to get the data I wanted to present. In my original visualization, the viewer&amp;rsquo;s positions were separated and stacked rather than combined as I had hoped. It took a lot of trial and error to produce a visualization that made me proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a project that combined qualitative and quantitative data also proved to be challenging. It took the analysis of numbers and a graph, and I had to look through it with a qualitative lens and understand the historical context. It was an insightful experience to have a combined project, but I think it strengthened my argument since I could analyze data and stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has given me a deeper insight into the Letters to the Editor section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I observed my visualization that looks at quantitative analysis of the delay between the written dates and published dates of the letters. The data showed trends and opposition or support of different topics. After combining this with the qualitative research about the contents of the Letters to the Editor section (specifically horse-goer agitation), I learned the value, of the newspaper, in publishing controversial topics. It increases viewership and reader involvement in a way that allows readers to voice their opinions and be more well-educated. What started as a project to figure out why people were so angry in letters to the paper, taught me a lot along the way. I sought to answer the difficult question about the purpose of the Letters to the Editor section, and I think there was a lot of fascinating data and stories to read through.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Change in grain production</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grain was an important crop in Egypt for a long period of time before cotton took over. Both wheat and barley were used for beer and bread. The period we are studying specifically in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is after this switch of crop occurred. Grains such as wheat and barley were still significant to the economic growth of Egypt. However, they were not as significant when the agricultural trends of Egypt shifted. In my individual research, I want to examine what the difference in cost and production of barley and wheat were. With this comparison, I think I will be able to answer the question of which grain was more useful and valuable to the people during this time period. I also plan to learn what the economic state was during this time and how it related to grain usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic growth of Egypt increased significantly under Cromer&amp;rsquo;s rule. Foreign trade was a specific aspect that increased. The grain exports slowly decreased during this time. According to the author Jeffery G. Collins, &amp;ldquo;Egypt&amp;rsquo;s other traditional exports, wheat, barley, maize, rice and beans, shrank or shifted entirely into import items while cigarettes remained the only manufactured product of any importance among exports&amp;rdquo;(Page 37, &amp;ldquo;The Egyptian Elite under Cromer 1882-1907: 1882-1907). These trends proved to be a worthy change in agriculture since foreign trade was increasing economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there was a huge increase in foreign trade, Egypt was still in a lot of debt. Their public debt rates went down after 1897, but the private debt increased beginning in 1903. These debts fluctuated several times during 1903-1907. Egypt’s government also had a lot of debt to pay to the Ottomans. According to Collins, “Egypt’s massive cotton exports served largely to pay tribute to the Ottomans, service the staggering interest on the debt sand even reduce the debt, though much of the reduction was also due to the sale of former royal lands” (Page 39). The shifts in agriculture production were intended to increase economic prosperity and to repair the economy&amp;rsquo;s weak spots, meaning the large debts that had interest rates adding even more to them yearly. This shows that the change in production of grain was essential since it was not as desired as crops like cotton. In the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; during the time period we are studying, the switch of agricultural trends already occurred. What the newspaper reports are the effects of these changes. Both the newspaper and this book prove that the shift was needed for Egypt’s economic growth. Looking at barley and wheat specifically, it is obvious that wheat is the more desired grain of the two. In fact, overall wheat was the most desired grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my individual research with the XPath search of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema01&amp;rdquo;]//cell[contains(.,‘Barley’)]/following-sibling::cell[2]/measure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me the change in price of barley over time. While I was doing the data for this specific topic, I noticed a trend in the cost. It usually stayed in the 70s. But the Maximum price listed was 110, and the minimum was 65. The raw data turned out to be over 200 items, so I will not be including that in my research paper. I then did a similar search to find the prices of wheat, but I did change how I phrased it so it would make more sense to me. I used the XPath below for wheat prices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema01”]//row[1]/cell[3]/measure&lt;br&gt;
With the two tables of prices, I was able to compare the differences and similarities. I will discuss these later on in the data visualization section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect that I wanted to research was the differences and similarities in production rates. I used the following XPaths to get this information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema02”]//row[4]/cell[3]/measure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//table[@xml:id= “deg-ta-cema02”]//row[1]/cell[3]/measure&lt;br&gt;
The raw data that I got from each of these queries are two long to list in the paper, otherwise I would have added this to the research section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
As seen in the visual above, wheat cost a significant amount more than barley. On average, wheat cost around 110-120 pts, while barley costed around 70 pts.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
As seen above, wheat on average was produced in quantities of thousands of ards. Barley is barely produced at 1,000 ards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat was a more desirable grain than barley, which made it more expensive and produced in larger quantities. These two crops were not produced nearly as much as the crops that were exported to other countries. The economical growth for Egypt depended on foreign trade so other crops such as cotton were produced more in order to meet the financial needs. While the trade of cotton managed to put a dent into the debt owed by Egypt to the Ottomans, grain remained a subtle but useful good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wheat Production and Importance in Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-grain-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-grain-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project analyzes the presence and importance of wheat in the eyes of the British in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in the early 20th century. Egyptian wheat production was a massively important part of the day to day life of Egypt for millennia, from the days of the Pharaoh to the 19th century. Wheat was the main subsistence crop throughout the Nile Delta, and allowed the Egyptians to be wildly successful and allowed them autonomy even when they were conquered. Wheat&amp;rsquo;s staple status primarily came through its use in the production of both bread and beer. This was shown in the Roman conquest of Egypt, where they were granted autonomy from Rome until Cleopatra took Mark Antony’s side in the last war of the Roman Republic. The major importance of Egypt being the wheat basket of the Mediterranean allowed it and its ruling parties power and independence. This all came to an end under Muhammad Ali Pasha, who through large irrigation projects and the change to cotton based farming led Egypt to become a more economic power instead of sustainance based farming. This led to Egypt becoming less dependent on wheat and more dependent on the economic benefits of selling cotton and using the profit to buy food and develop the country overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;government-influence&#34;&gt;Government influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government had a variety of programs to increase agriculture. One of the main crops they pushed was the production of wheat. One of the programs was the Cairo Agricultural show; this was an opportunity for the grower to show off their wheat production to potential buyers. It was a great networking event for many people. The Suez canal was a significant government transportation portal for the exporting of wheat. Great Britain exported most of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s wheat, leaving little for the people: “as little as 1/5 of the wheat was kept for the people” (&lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;). The 1/5 portion was processed into other products such as bread. This policy of increasing economic revenue was done with a little more of a selfish nature  rather than helping the individual farmer. However, to make up for this selfish nature, the government had to deal with the crime of people stealing each other’s crops and took these cases very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, controversy began to grow about whether wheat or cotton was more profitable. The British saw wheat as mainly a single-dimensional product that was only for flour production. The big cash crop was cotton due to the greater demand during the US civil war and greater transferability. This is mentioned throughout the article “British flour for Egypt” in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Although the British thought this, they still did a lot to help increase the production of wheat; in the Egyptian Gazette, the feature “abridged prospectus” explained the process of purchasing the land and how the process was meant to incentivize people to buy and start cultivating the wheat crop. The most popular land was lower Egypt which had the rich soil to grow good wheat. The process of securing land could get a little complicated, but there was a program to help poorer people get their foot in the door. Through this program, you could buy a share of land and make payments. However, if you miss only one payment, your entire land could be revoked. These payments could be expensive, especially with the hefty tax you pay to auditors. This extreme policy really pressured farmers to produce most of the crops. This excessive production made local articles such as “Khartoum’s wheat crop” describe wheat as a very profitable crop since it was written from the local perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; has an article called &amp;ldquo;British Flour,&amp;rdquo; which was written in March 4, 1907. Throughout this text, the author talks about the shift from wheat production to more cotton production due to its further profitability. So, the government shifted focus and realized money was better than extra production. The article details how as wheat increased, the demand and sales remained the same, and the primary consumers were the British Mill, which had its own competition with the French miller for being a top supplier. Our second visual below about wheat prices displays how although foreign governments such as the British didn&amp;rsquo;t increase their wheat purchase during March of 1907, wheat remained at a steady price due to Egypt&amp;rsquo;s ability to distribute the extra grain elsewhere. This displays wheat&amp;rsquo;s ability to have stable and growing production and how it was an essential part of commerce, even though government support was shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially decided to find out how often wheat was mentioned in each feature within the Egyptian gazette. This piece of information would show how relevant this specific crop is and what times during the year that it is being discussed. The following query was used to find this information:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,&#39;wheat&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data showed us that there was not a specific time of the month or a season that wheat was discussed like we had assumed. It is relevant throughout the year. However it is mentioned the least during months June, August, and November. Wheat was mentioned in exportManifest more frequently compared to the other features. This search gave 56 items, which are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

      The chart above tracks the price of wheat varieties (lows and highs) from 1905 to 1908. The data proves to be extremely consistent with the Mawani variety consistently being the most expensive and the Tugari variety being consistently the cheapest each year besides in December and April. What makes this especially interesting is that in those two months, Tugari is able to compete with Middling, all due to it reaching highs of 146 around the midpoint of the month and continuing to hover around the low 140’s for the remainder of the month, leading to the sudden closeness in the data points we see in the chart.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our research, we accomplished our goal of finding out the significance of wheat during this time period. Together we have gathered a mixture of qualitative and quantitative research to develop a better picture of the impact of wheat cultivation. With this better picture, we were able to highlight the importance of this crop. Through our deep dive into the Egyptian Gazette, we also established that wheat was a main crop that was produced. Furthermore, we examined the effects that the native government and foreign influence had on the production and use of Wheat. The data showed how significant this crop was in the process of cultivating economic growth for Egypt, especially under British control. Detailed evidence, such ⅕ of the production of wheat, was given to the people in Egypt; the rest was exported to other countries, which led us to formulate more complex conclusions. The most apparent conclusion we were able to draw was that, over time, cotton became the main crop since there was more of a demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disease Disparities in the Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-dininger/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2022-analysis-dininger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As in all newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to reporting on disease cases. From 1905-1907, the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; mentions various diseases 1,688 times. Despite this large figure, the specific breakdown of which diseases are mentioned more often than others reveals a vast inequality in the amount of mentions per disease. To gather this data, I performed several Xpath queries to determine the number of mentions of different diseases in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, both in total and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’plague’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’bilharzia’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’pneumonia’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’small pox’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’tuberculosis’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[matches(.,’cholera’, ‘i’)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast in mentions is immediately obvious upon viewing the data, and raises several questions of why the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; chose its content in this way. This analysis will attempt to explain these disparities in context of when the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was written, and who it was written for.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1880, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was a newspaper written by British citizens who had moved to Egypt. Early on, it “became the mouthpiece for British policy in Egypt” and was heavily monitored by Lord Cromer, the British Controller-General (Carcanague). Cromer had a large role in the control of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, and it is suspected that he personally subsidized the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. As Controller-General, Cromer was responsible for the administration of Egypt while under British control from 1883-1907 (Lockman).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say that the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was a distinctly British entity, written by the British, for the British, and containing British opinions. The reason why this is important is that the motivations of the authors of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; are directly related to their audience: British subjects. As emphasized in journalism, one of the key hallmarks of success in the news industry is to know your audience, and write about issues that they have an interest in (Santiago). In the case of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, this means that they were tasked with writing about issues that their fellow British subjects in Egypt were interested in, all while keeping in line with Cromer’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the audience of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is crucial to understanding the disparities between which diseases they featured in their issues. Since it was written for British citizens, one can assume that they tended to focus on diseases that tended to impact that population the most. This assumption is not made blindly; it is supported by a comparison of the disease mentions to actual cases during this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest cases of the gap between cases and coverage pertains to the disease bilharzia. In her chapter analysis “Cruel Summer,” historian Jennifer Derr provides an account focusing on the prevalence of parasitic diseases, and how new methods of agriculture caused them to become quite common in society (Derr). One of the principal diseases caused by these parasites was schistosomiasis, or as it was referred to in the 1900s, bilharzia. One of the key takeaways from Derr is just how widespread these parasites were in Egypt in this time period, with her stating that the “majority of the populations with regions with access to perennial irrigation” were afflicted. This issue was not something unknown to wider Egypt either; as early as 1838, Italian physician Angelo Dubini identified parasitic worms in the autopsies of Egyptians. These discoveries eventually morphed into scientific investigations of this issue as the 1800s progressed, even getting attention from the Sanitary Department. Derr’s analysis establishes two facts critical to the disparities in attention of diseases: bilharzia was very widespread during this time period and it had been identified as a disease decades prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these facts, one might wonder why bilharzia is only mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; a measly four times over the course of 1905-1907 as revealed by an Xpath query. A potential answer to this issue relates back to the audience of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. While bilharzia was extremely widespread, it was primarily found among Egyptian agricultural workers spending their time in wet, irrigated fields where the parasites easily spread. Since we have already established that the audience of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; would not have been these workers, it stands to reason that it was neglected due to being seen as an Egyptian problem. Compare the 4 mentions of bilharzia to the 1,270 mentions of the plague. Being that the disease killed ⅓ of Europe in the 1300s, all Europeans were quite familiar with the risk of the plague and the knowledge that it was highly contagious. While it certainly did see a high case number during this period, bilharzia did as well, and yet received 318% fewer mentions. This suggests that the audience of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; had a much higher interest in reading about plague than bilharzia. Therefore, the context of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;’s author and audience could have quite plausibly played into what content they chose to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional investigation I conducted was to analyze the mentions of different diseases restricted to advertisements. I chose advertisements because they reflect public consumption and which issues are being emphasized by both consumers and suppliers. The XPath query for this question restricted the results to those labeled as “advert”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revealed the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;typhoid&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;smallpox&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;small pox&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;pneumonia&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;plague&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;bilharzia)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;tuberculosis&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, despite having far fewer total mentions than several other diseases, tuberculosis had the most mentions in the advertisement section. These results could have resulted from many factors, including poor knowledge of medicine at the time. However, the 0 mentions of bilharzia echo bilharzia’s few overall mentions and add to the idea that it was neglected by the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing Agricultural Bank Stocks between different Exchanges in the Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-barry/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-barry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of Agricultural Banks, facilitated through government tax collectors to distribute loans, originally started in the early 1880s in India. Lord Cromer, a prominent figure in Egypt’s economy, was originally pitched this idea by William Wedderburn while “serving in India as Finance Member of Lord Ripon’s government”. Lord Cromer was fond of the idea and pitched it to the Government of India, however, they rejected the idea. Lord Cromer then carried this idea to the Egyptian Government, where they finally established the “Agricultural Bank of Egypt in May of 1902”. The idea proved to be promising as it initially attracted a lot of investors as well as clients (Jakes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project aims to analyze the movement of the Agricultural Bank stocks on the different exchanges listed in the Egyptian Gazette. I mainly focus on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/issues/templates/#london-stock-exchange&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;: “Agricultural Banks” and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/issues/templates/#bourse-du-caire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cairo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;: “Agricultural Bank of Egypt”. To gather this data, I originally used the following Queries to locate my desired data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-bduc01&amp;quot;]/table[1]/row[3]/cell[3]/measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-lsex01&amp;quot;]/table[1]/row[3]/cell[3]/measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these queries located some of my data, it was evident that along the line there was a template change in both stock exchanges which led to inaccurate data. In order to combat, this I updated the following queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-lsex01&amp;quot;]/table[1]/row/cell[contains(., &amp;quot;Agricultural Banks&amp;quot;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-bduc01&amp;quot;]/table[1]/row/cell[contains(., &amp;quot;Agricultural Bank of Egypt&amp;quot;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This updated query gave me more accurate data, however, it was clear from the repeated values that a lot of the issues included the templated value and not the issue&amp;rsquo;s actual value. In order to combat this, I had to double check the microscanned pages and manually fill in some values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upward trends in the graph could be facilitated through a multitude of reasons. The first being the initial upward trend could be a result of the reaction of the public to the newly created agricultural banks. As explained by Aaron Jakes, “Its mortgages at 9% interest seemed to offer the bank’s clients an appealing alternative to existing forms of local moneylending” (Jakes). Additionally, the influx of foreign money coming into Egypt propelled a lot of land owners into participating in one of Egypt&amp;rsquo;s main agricultural exports at the time, cotton. Agricultural Banks established by Lord Cromer seemed to be an easy way into the agricultural industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downward trends can be explained by the apparent problems with the Agricultural Bank&amp;rsquo;s structure as well as environmental problems during the early 1900s. While the foreign capital influenced landowners to enter the industry, the majority of the foreign money flowed directly into the pockets of wealthy landowners in the industry. Additionally, the foreign money also “drove down the profitability of loans against agricultural land and produce” (Jakes). The main driving force in the downward trends would be a result of the “cotton worm”. The cotton worm not only destroyed cotton seeds but also weakened the soil quality on which cotton was grown, decreasing yields. This caused people to stay out of the industry driving the Agricultural Bank’s stocks downwards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing the Reasons for the Popularity of Snake Oil in Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-yanevich/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when individuals, without any credentials, can make bold claims about a product and convince the public that they have the ‘miracle cure’ that can cure any disease? In a hypothetically rational society, this would be a great failure, and likely shut down very quickly as government officials would see this as a scam. However, in a time when the public is generally less skeptical of the media and more gullible towards misinformation, as a result of a lower standard of living and information not spreading around as easily as it does today, it would make sense that almost anyone could create a fake cure to multiple diseases and sell it as this sort of ‘miracle cure’ that you see with products advertised in the Egyptian Gazette, such as Peruna and Pink Pills for Pale People. Due to the lack of good medicine and understanding of how to treat severe diseases such as Cholera or kidney disease, snake oil cures became popular as what would be an alternative for people who were desperate at the time to cure deadly ailments and were especially even more appealing towards a society with a much lower standard of living and a very low standard of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People contained miracle stories of patients making amazing recoveries from illnesses that would have them on the verge of death, but once they started taking these mysterious pills, the illness would go away. One problem with these stories is that they could have been made up, and there was no way for anyone to verify whether they were true or not. Another is that they all followed the same exact format of progression, starting with talking about how they were so ill that they were on death’s door, and none of the doctors had any idea what to do. Then, it would go to saying that they tried the pink pills, with a quote such as, “Then someone recommended me Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People, and all my troubles were cured.” The format for the stories that were apparently submitted by customers were essentially all the same and were all written in incredibly formal tones with similar styles, hinting at the fact that they were likely made up. Peruna’s advertising strategy was very similar to this as well. All of the advertisements were written in ways in the newspapers that would make them look more like a news story rather than an advertisement too, a clever marketing scheme that would make it less likely for the reader to quickly skim over the advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph basically shows the total amount of mentions of each medicine per year throughout the Egyptian Gazette. It gives the viewer a general idea of how the popularity of the medicines increased over these three years, but it doesn’t take into account whether some advertisements may have mentioned ‘Pink Pills’ for example maybe only twice, or maybe 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph here shows the total amount of articles each year that mention either Peruna or Pink Pills. You can see that there is a significant increase in the popularity in both over the course of 1905 through 1907. This graph gives a pretty accurate idea of how many more advertisements there were for both ‘Peruna’ and ‘Pink Pills’ over the years, but one other factor to consider is the ratio of advertisements for both companies to the total number of issues of the Gazette per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last graph does that, in that it shows the percentage of how many mentions of both ‘Peruna’ and ‘Pink Pills’ there were to the total number of issues of the Egyptian Gazette each year. Even when this percentage is considered, it can still be seen that there is still a significant increase in the frequency of these kinds of advertisements each year. It can be concluded that the popularity of the advertisements for ‘Pink Pills’ and ‘Peruna’ likely increased in Egypt between 1905 to 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major question that is faced with this data is why are people gullible to these alternative medicines? It is obvious that one of the reasons is due to the lack of medical knowledge and transparency a century ago, but there is a bigger part of the explanation that many leave out. “Studies show that satisfaction with mainstream media is not an important factor in deciding to use CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine), that CAM users are generally satisfied with their mainstream care, and they use CAM because it aligns with their philosophy, and they simply want to expand their options.” (Steven Novella 2012, Why Do People turn to Alternative Medicine) It can be concluded from this that people today and in the past have also fallen for these scams due to wanting to have many different options and that they simply have the idea in mind of trying anything to cure the illness that they have. It seems that it is desperation that clouds people’s judgement to go towards snake oil cures, such as Peruna or Pink Pills, which would have been especially prevalent in early 20th century Egypt, due to the prevalence of diseases such as cholera, which makes people turn to anything that promises any sort of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tobacco and Cigarette Exports from Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-jankowski/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-jankowski/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the mid-19th century, tobacco consumption began to gain popularity through the Ottoman Empire and Egypt. The tobacco industry thrived in Egypt alongside the “development of industrialized agriculture cash crops,” and Egypt was known for exporting luxury cigarettes around the world. Beginning in 1860, the Ottoman Empire’s state monopoly on tobacco only awarded Greek and Ottoman tobaccomen the right to cultivate tobacco (Shechter). This led to the expansion of the cigarette industry with the arrival of more tobaccomen from Greece and the Ottoman Empire, with the emergence of large-scale cigarette factories from previously smaller made-to-order tobacco stores. Eventually, in 1903, the Egyptian government adds a separate cigarette section to the annual foreign commerce reports (Shechter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial research question I set out to analyze examined the cigarette and tobacco exports from Alexandria to Constantinople listed under the “Export Manifests.” From using the following queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&#39;exportManifests&#39;]//p[contains(., &#39;CONST&#39;)]/following-sibling::p[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&#39;exportManifests&#39;]//p[contains(., &#39;CONST&#39;)]/following-sibling::p[2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&#39;exportManifests&#39;]//p[contains(., &#39;CONST&#39;)]/following-sibling::p[3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find several data points under the Export Manifests feature containing the letters “Const” (for Constantinople), and that were in the paragraphs immediately, two, and three after the word “Const.”
From the table below, it is evident that there were not enough available data points to draw conclusions or analyze the data available for larger patterns or trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amt  of  Tobacco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;01-29-1906&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3-28-1906&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;56&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Piraeus  &amp;amp;  Const&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Const  and  Rhodos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After conducting a new query that looked at just tobacco exports from the Export Manifests feature, I was able to gather a much wider time series, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Amount&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Destination&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1905-01-13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1905-03-03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Port Said/Syria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two charts show the amount of tobacco export over time (Chart 1) and the density of tobacco exports by final location (Chart 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another avenue of research that required further research was the quantity of cigarettes exported to Germany. The Shechter paper mentions Germany specifically as a top imported of Egyptian luxury cigarettes but does not provide any details further than noting that exports to Germany “dropped sharply after 1905 as a result of new tariff barriers” and that Germany was a “significant importer until 1914” (Shechter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after expanding the query to all available tobacco exports, it is still difficult to draw any conclusions regarding export patterns. There’s no clear trend as far as destination city or seasonal trends in where the tobacco is exported to. Furthermore, it was not possible to expand my query in this way by looking at cigarette exports because there were so many results; however, there were fewer entries under tobacco making it possible to extrapolate the numbers manually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Austria-Hungary Influenced Egypt Through Its Imports and Exports</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-roy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth century was clearly defined as an age of empires as great European powers colonized the globe and extended their vast influence through trade or other means. While the Austro-Hungarian Empire wasn’t significantly involved in the Scramble for Africa or other colonial endeavors, the aging empire did still actively exert influence outside of Europe. Egypt was one of those nations where their presence was felt at the turn of the twentieth century, and this can be attributed to multiple factors. The first major reason for this influence was that in important Egyptian cities like Alexandria, Austro-Hungarians made up the fifth largest European community by 1905.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As well, Austro-Hungarian currency was heavily present and widely used in Egypt and the Middle East as they produced the Maria Theresa Dollar which was a global currency as it traveled from Austria through the Ottoman Empire where it became engrained in African and Middle Eastern societies.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The final reason for Austria-Hungary’s influence in Egypt was its exports and imports with the nation. In this analysis I will only be analyzing the significance of these trade relations, and through Austria-Hungary’s trade of furniture goods to Egypt and its trade of fresh fish from Egypt it’s evident that Austria-Hungary did have a significant presence in Egyptian society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To inaugurate, the major import that Austria-Hungary and Austro-Hungarian businesses contributed to Egypt was furniture such as bentwood which was fashioned into chairs and other furnishings. Bentwood was important during the 1900s because cities like Alexandria were growing every year due to Europeans moving there or touring for extended periods of time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To support the creation of new houses for these newcomers, furniture was essential, and bentwood chairs were one of those items constantly in demand as Egypt grew. Austria-Hungary was the nation best suited to take advantage of this market for furniture because of its low freight rates and the labor to make furniture in Austria-Hungary cost less to produce bentwood products than any other European nation like Britain could.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The exact comparison in how much lower Austro-Hungarian prices were was that “packing, freight, insurance, and duty from Austria 25 per cent of an invoice, whilst from London these charges amount to… 35 per cent”.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The result was that Austria-Hungary imported nearly 43% of all furniture to Egypt from 1900-1904. This threatened nations like Britain who wanted to expand their control of the furniture trade to Egypt so they began advertising English furniture more heavily which is evident in “The Egyptian Gazette” through articles advertising “High Class English Furniture” catalogues for the public to view and browse.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was done because English merchants knew they couldn’t compete with Austria-Hungary’s lower prices so they tried making theirs seem of a higher quality and class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Austria-Hungary also exerted influence in Egypt through its exports from the nation because it contributed to Egyptian businesses, and one of the most significant and interesting export was that of fresh fish. I discovered there was a significant trade of barrels of fresh fish from Egypt to Austria-Hungary because I had noticed Klink and Lauer was a company that consistently exported barrels of fresh fish to Brindisi and Trieste, and through a report on the Fishing and Aquaculture Exhibition at the Milan Exposition of 1906, I discovered the company made products like sardine oil and operated out of Trieste which was a major Austro-Hungarian port.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Knowing that I hoped to compare its export of fresh fish to that of the rest of the world to ascertain its influence over this trade of fresh fish, but I was very surprised to learn there were only two companies from October 1905 to January 1908 which regularly exported fresh fish from Egypt.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This other company was under the name A. Frick, and interestingly he exported fresh fish to Brindisi and Trieste from 1905- February 1907 while Klink and Lauer started in February 1907 and went until 1908 exporting primarily on the exact same route. While I couldn’t find scholarly articles expressing why there was a demand for fresh fish in Brindisi or Trieste outside of the nature of Klink and Lauer creating sardine oil, I do hypothesize that A. Frick is associated with Klink and Lauer due to the same routes and how smooth the transition for exports was with only one overlap in February 1907. This monopoly of fresh fish regularly going to one place over the course of nearly two and a half years displays that there was a demand and market for the product, but due to limited mentions of fresh fish in “The Egyptian Gazette” in articles and limited outside resources mentioning that trade I’m unable to dig further.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, Austria-Hungary is clearly shown to have had significance and a role in Egyptian society because of how active it was in the importing of furniture and exporting of fish. The furniture was important because Austria-Hungary was uniquely able to produce cheap furniture that enabled those moving to Egypt to buy furnishings there. The export of fresh fish was unique because they seem to possible be the only ones who monopolized on that trade which likely helped fuel a part of that industry which focused on foreign exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reflecting on this project, I really enjoyed how Oxygen made it easy to quickly search for terms across all the articles of “The Egyptian Gazette”, but misspellings of company names like Klink becoming “Klenk” in several export manifests, the inconsistencies on whether the exports were called “casks” or “barrels” of fresh fish, and even whether the exports were fresh fish or just “fish” made me have to search for a lot of different key terms to put my results together. I also originally intended to compare the number of barrels of fish going to Trieste to that of the rest of the world, but because Brindisi and Trieste was the route where all this trade happened, it wasn’t needed. As well, I had the option of several exports to focus on, but I didn’t choose the Austro-Hungarian company Puntigam which exported empty casks because there were nearly 750 results for empty casks in export manifests and Puntigam only contributed 20 so it was clear that company wouldn’t display significant Austro-Hungarian influence over the trade of empty casks. And finally, it was incredibly difficult finding information on these exporters like Klink and Lauer and A. Frick so I was left with many questions about them, and the lack of an import manifest limited my options for what goods I could show Austria-Hungary contributed to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How the number of visitors in Alexandria Egypt from 1906 to 1908 changed leading up to the financial collapse.</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-walton/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2021-analysis-walton/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to financial collapse in early 20th century Egypt, a change in the number of visitors would be expected. Hard times were faced as Egypt was coming up on multiple crises. The hard times would seemingly create a change in how many people are visiting Egypt. In the early 20th century Egypt was struggling against cotton worms, disease, financial collapse, over-farming, and political instability. Given the high number of issues arising in Egypt a shift in the number of tourists and visitors on business would be expected. In addition a change in the ratio between the two groups of visitors would also be expected. After looking deeper, the data points to no obvious trend, up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Boom, Bugs, Bust: Egypt’s Ecology of Interest, 1882–1914,&amp;rdquo; Aron Jakes explores the intersection of the numerous crises in Egypt. Along with this Jakes also elaborates on how all the crises came together, amplifying each other. The dire situation faced in Egypt had many effects on everyday life in Egypt. For example Jakes discusses the employment of forced child labor. The server condition in Egypt would seemingly lower the number of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to gather data for a visualization of the number of visitors in Alexandria I used both the Visitors List and the Nile Tourists features. The two XPath queries I used are &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][contains( . , &#39;VISITORS LIST&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][contains( . , &#39;VISITORS LIST&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;. I copied the years with the start location and end location. I used the formula &lt;code&gt;=C1-B1&lt;/code&gt; to give me the number of lines taken up by the section. The difference of the start and end location gives me an estimate of how many people were visiting Alexandria in comparison to other days. The numerical value of the difference has no other significance outside of the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize my findings I used multiple graphs. The first and second show the relation of Visitors List length to the date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of the graphs show no correlation between the progression towards the financial crisis and the number of visitors in Alexandria. The data range is wide in all four years examined. The graphs oscillate continuously. In addition to the lack of trend, the data also has major time gaps, making it impossible to estimate which years had the longest visitors list or Nile Tourists feature. After reviewing my results, it has become evident the rise of crises in Egypt did not affect tourism. From 1905 to 1908 there was neither an up or down trend in the number of visitors in Alexandria. It is possible in the years closer to 1914 there is a more visible change in tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rabies is caused by a RNA virus, by a number of animal. Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, resulting in death in infected human. Globally, the risk of rabies for humans is great in areas of the developing countries where rabies is common. Rabies can lead the animal into paralysis. Another thing is it sometimes causes an animal to lose its fear to humans. However, when humans, get rabies, their symptoms start out with simple headaches and fever and later progress to terrible things such as becoming hydrophobic because of painful throat spasms and paralysis. The virus is transmitted thru the bite and virus containing saliva of an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much has been said and written about the Cairo police in the Egyptian newspaper. The Cairo police has brutally treated poorly the dogs. Dogs back in 1905 were not commonly thought of as dearly as people do now in days. However, since 1905, Alexandria experienced a volume of dogs having rabies. The Cairo police, have without previous motive or permission, sent down there to kill the dogs and poisoned any dog that is on the station or the streets irrespective of ownership or whether the dogs were &amp;ldquo;pariah.&amp;rdquo; The action has caused some dissatisfaction prevention to animal in Cairo when it was happening. In addition,  due to the large numbers of dogs are being poised and shot by the Cairo police in the city. The Regulations on Dogs, and have issued an order to the office that all dogs in the streets must either be muzzled or led. The muzzle must be of one of the descriptions which are to be seen at the Municipality&amp;rsquo;s central sanitary office. Owners of dogs are given one moths like, until the 27th November, to conform to this regulation. Infringements after that date will be severely punished. However, the police in Cairo was killing the dogs because the rabies were infecting humans. A total of 16 deaths claims of rabies, 7 at Cairo and 4 at Alexandria. Influenza terminated fatally in 85 cases, of which 18 were at Cairo and 6 at Alexandria. There were 19 deaths from leprosy. Medinet el-Fayoum had no less than 4 fatal cases out of the total, the balance being spread in even proportions all over Egypt. Puerperal fever terminated fatally in 215 cases, of which 75 were at Cairo and 44 at Alexandria. There were 136 deaths from whooping cough, 31 at Suez, 16 at Cairo, and 3 at Alexandria. Small- pox  was responsible for 1,093 and measles for 5, 260 deaths. Diphtheria was very fatal out of 586 fatal cases for all Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing searches about dogs in particular, there were not much articles that came up about how many dogs cot killed by the Cairo police for having rabies. While there are other blog posts about different animals and dogs, I saw few records of dogs getting killed for having rabies. I ran multiple XPath’s to be able to have a little chart explaining how many dogs the Cairo police killed from 1905 all the way to 1907. In each issue the Egyptian Gazette that was analyzed from my week there was one about “The Cairo Police” which for me was very interesting it was a subsection that fell below the general as well as the local portion of the paper. I started to work with the Cairo police article but honestly nothing seem interesting for me until I started reading about how the police was killing ownerless dog. This lead to the question Why are dogs getting killed by the Cairo police? To search through the digital Egyptian gazette at first was really hard to really look what was the actual idea of why the dogs were getting killed . In particular, I started using &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;section&amp;quot;]/div/p[contains(., &#39;dog&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; which brought me to the general and local section but for me that was not enough there is where I started reading that back In the early 19th century Egypt was filled with cases of dogs having rabies leading to the police killing them. Later on I started to look at rabies, Cairo dogs, police, registration of dogs, and rabid. Doing a search of &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;section&amp;quot;]/div/p[contains(., &#39;dog rabies&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;. This gave me an estimate of how many dogs the police of Cairo were killing since 1905 all the way to 1907. While doing this analysis project and doing research in the digital Egyptian Gazette I end up to the conclusion that stray dogs were never really under control as much as many dogs were killed and poison more continue to come. After that a regulation came that all dogs needed to be register with a collar that had a “metallic plaque” with a registration number. If the dogs were found without a registration number they were keep the dog for 5 days and then the police will poison them or killed them. For me this analysis project was challenging at first but realizing all the information that I learned from this was great. In conclusion, Egypt had a horrible case of those being stray because of this problem the city later on had rabies that were killing a lot of people leading to the police either poisoning the dogs or killing them since they had rabies and their difficulty to cure it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Mystery of Daira Sanieh</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-chen/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-chen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individual research extends the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-stocks/&#34;&gt;group project on the topic of economics and trade in Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. After the war with Britain, Egypt was turned into a colony of Britain. Its economy had significant growth from the business introduced by the British. Businessman and the Egyptian colonial government promoted the transfer of western industry to the locals. They strived to make the region like a European state. &lt;sup name=&#34;a1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To achieve that, many local resources such as arable lands and mineral pits were used for growing crops and mining. As more local industries started trading with other parts of the world, the stock and exchange market formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-history-of-daira-senieh&#34;&gt;The History of Daira Senieh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was the primary source for this analysis project. A company named Daira Senieh caught my attention. The classification of Daira Senieh was ambiguous. During the group project, some of my research partners found that the company was associated with land. However, Daira Senieh was also a sugar company that owned several agricultural plants and sugar cane fields. The company was known for its sugar plantation in Upper Egypt and its massive freight transportation. Samir Raafat, a former banker, a columnist, wrote in his article that Daira Senieh owned 470 km of railroad lines, 65 locomotives, and 2,092 wagons. &lt;sup name=&#34;a2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Even in the present day, the company&amp;rsquo;s scale is sizable. Additionally, the company originated from lands of the Egyptian royal family. There was a time when the company had a financial crisis. Egypt had a loss of its political sovereignty around the 1870s as the foreign rivalry entered. However, one study suspected that Egypt had sufficient resources and potential economic growth. Still, the reformed British government had mismanaged Egypt&amp;rsquo;s financial revenue, so the depression of the Egyptian companies started forming. &lt;sup name=&#34;a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Companies like Daira Senieh had to either borrow loans or sell the company&amp;rsquo;s assets, such as lands. In addition, the bad harvest and Russo-Turkish War aggravated Egypt&amp;rsquo;s financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-occurrence-of-daira-senieh&#34;&gt;The Occurrence of Daira Senieh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of the company in this analysis, I queried the data set of the newest DEG .xml archives (right before first-time publishing this article.) I thought the occurrence of Daira Senieh might leave hints on its economic activities in different periods. I, therefore, sorted out the data via the XPath 2.0 search with the code, &lt;code&gt;count(//div/head[matches(.,&#39;Daira&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/following-sibling::p)&lt;/code&gt;, and got the result which revealed in the following treemap (cubics) and bar graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe seamless frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Book2_15765347843500/Cubics?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going further in-depth with the date featured with Daira Senieh, I found more content that is relevant to the companies&amp;rsquo; shares and properties. Other than the company name found in Stock and Exchange, Page 3 articles often wrote about company meetings involved with legal, liabilities, assets of the company. Along these lines, the occurrence helped to link the history and changes of Daira Senieh. It additionally enriched the explanations of the events of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privatization-of-land&#34;&gt;Privatization of Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the company had relationships with the Egyptian royal family. At surface level, its land could be the company&amp;rsquo;s private property, but, in reality, it also could be seen as the state&amp;rsquo;s territory/land. It attempted to bail out the company through auctions. As we know, the company had Royal family ties, so the auction set by Daira Senieh was controversial because the properties of the company could also be deemed as the nation&amp;rsquo;s properties. Indeed, auctions on lands ended with a failure. In one report published by The Brisbane Courier &lt;sup name=&#34;a4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, an Australia newspaper, the sale of Daira Senieh had disapproval from the English and the French syndicate groups. The Egyptian government demanded to have one-third of a share from the final sale price which hindered the auction process. Subsequent to the auction held in the last ten years, the company &amp;ldquo;was unable to let a single acre of the sugar lands for 1888 in eight out of nine districts, and only 95 acres in the ninth district (the number offered to be let being about 25,000).” &lt;sup name=&#34;a5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
In the 1900 Annual Report by Consul-General Cromer on the Finances, Administration, and Condition of Egypt, an excerpt stated, &amp;ldquo;the Government and the Company share equally in the net profit derived from the sale of land… meanwhile … the company now offers to sell lands on payment of one-tenth of the price, before 1905, after which time the buyers will have the option of paying the balance in cash or in fifteen annuities.&amp;rdquo; It seemed that the government and Daria Seineh were encouraging peasants to be the owner of the debts, but it also sold out the land to foreign proprietors. &lt;sup name=&#34;a6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Daira Senieh Loan
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Daira Senieh continued to privatize its agricultural properties, the value of the lands, which was diluted on the open market, increased tremendously &lt;sup name=&#34;a1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the company&amp;rsquo;s consortium gained revenue, which exceeded their outstanding debts, so it paid off its debt of 4,444,340 Para in 1905, according to the World Bank documentation &lt;sup name=&#34;a7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f7&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, more foreign competitors acquired lands from Daira Senieh to begin their industry in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;sale_of_daira.jpg&#34; width=&#34;216&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stock-value-analysis&#34;&gt;Stock Value Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of this research project is focused on the years of the newspaper I could access, between the year 1905 to the year 1908. I adopted the Stock and Share table, which described Egyptian companies&amp;rsquo; value changes. I used an Xpath query to search the latest content repository, which was updated by the end of Fall 2019. Inserting &lt;code&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-stsh01&amp;quot;]/table//cell[contains(.,&#39;New Daira Sanieh Fond&#39;)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/code&gt;, 126 results was found. I then organized the data with a trendline graph.
The accuracy of the data obtained from Xpath 2.0 is plausible. This is mostly due to the incomplete updates in the .xml files for the tables of measures. Besides, some outliers in the graph below could be the typo during the process of digitizing the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe seamless frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DairaSeniehStock/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the data, we can roughly see the growth of Daira Senieh&amp;rsquo;s stock which might due to the sale of lands. Its decline after 1905 also coincides with the nation&amp;rsquo;s GDP since the company&amp;rsquo;s size shared a significant component of the Egyptian economy. It is known that Egypt went through economic crisis in 1907&lt;sup name=&#34;a8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f8&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This matched with the highlighted region of the real GDP graph showing below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a glimpse of the economics of Egypt in the 1900s, I found Daira Senieh was established during the invasion of Britain. However, it had some crisis in finance in 1886, perhaps due to warfare. In the later decades, the company announced its bankruptcy and put its lands on sale. This incident was later known as the Daira Senieh scandal. &lt;sup name=&#34;a9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#f9&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After it sold a fraction of the company owned lands, the company escaped the danger of bankruptcy. As the side effect of the sold lands, it reshaped Egypt&amp;rsquo;s economy. The government gained fortune from the auction to fill the financial holes of national debts, but opened the door for the foreign influences on its domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-background&#34;&gt;Historical Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton played a vital role in Egyptian economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Ottoman governor Mehmed ‘Ali Pasha instituted corvée, in which peasant workers were conscripted into the cotton fields and other government projects such as building the Suez Canal. Throughout his reign, ‘Ali held tight control over Egypt’s economy and trade. The profits of exports were used to fund ‘Ali’s many military campaigns. However, Ali’s successors wanted to open Egypt up to European investors. By the time of Khedive Isma&amp;rsquo;il, Egypt was borrowing heavily from French and British banks on the supposition that cotton harvests would pay them back. In the 1860s, the vacuum left by the American Civil War did cause cotton prices to rise and Egypt’s cotton market to prosper. However, the influx of cotton after the Civil War caused a series of events that culminated in Egypt going bankrupt in 1876. As the economy spiraled, Egyptian citizens grew restless. General Ahmad ‘Urabi Pasha spearheaded a revolt with the support of Egypt’s citizens. In 1882, Britain took control of Egypt and ended the revolt in order to protect her investment, all under the guise of promoting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.e-ir.info/2009/03/23/the-british-invasion-of-egypt-1882/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“honesty, humanity and justice.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under consul-general Lord Evelyn Baring Cromer, cotton yields in Egypt increased rapidly through the end of the 19th century, aided by restructuring of irrigation, taxes, and land-ownership. This productivity encouraged investors from various countries to participate in a web of over-speculation that eventually burst in March of 1907. The following economic crisis was fueled by declining cotton yields, caused by the cotton worm, weakened seeds, and worsening soil quality. Irrigation policies developed by British engineers had actually flooded and brined the soil. The failures of certain British policies revitalized nationalist movements against outside interference and may have led to Cromer’s resignation in 1907. However, Egypt did not gain independence until after the events of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/egyptian-independence-1919-22/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choosing-a-data-source&#34;&gt;Choosing a Data Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the informal British occupation of Egypt, cotton exports were used to determine the state of the economy and whether new policies should be kept. Therefore, I decided to examine the table &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. This table details cotton exports to various countries and total monthly exports in balles (French for bales). As determined in the post &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/17-analysis-fricano/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cotton Trade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Nino Fricano, a bale of cotton at this time was approximately 20% smaller than the standard modern bale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the following XPath query to obtain the total monthly cotton export value from every &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table currently within &lt;em&gt;The Digital Egyptian Gazette’s&lt;/em&gt; content repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;ldquo;deg-el-cotn01&amp;rdquo;]/table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;balles&amp;rsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolating only the dates and values in Atom and importing them into Tableau, I was able to create the following line graph of cotton export trends from 1905 to 1907.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Line graph showing original, unedited cotton export values by month
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the uncorrected data, the value &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53,232&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is quite prevalent. This identical value given for months in succession creates the horizontal portions of the graph above. Such an aberration within the raw data makes sense, as 53,232 is the number inputted within the original template. Any edition of &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in which the &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table was simply copied and not corrected would retain that value. It is clear that the raw data does not provide an accurate enough perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;correcting-the-tables&#34;&gt;Correcting the Tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, since the &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table is a monthly recitation of exports, it should logically only change every four weeks. In order to narrow my search results, I decided to select the first date and &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table from every month. Therefore, the pool of data to be proofed ended up only being 27 separate tables. Of these 27 tables, 10 of them contained the stock value while 2 others contained the same value as the previous month. Thankfully, this much more manageable number would still result in a complete data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;complications&#34;&gt;Complications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complication that I encountered while correcting my sample of tables was unexpected. As it turns out, various encoders have made the same mistake of dropping in the &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table when the actual microfilm used another table, &lt;strong&gt;ctns01&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;ctns01&lt;/strong&gt; table shows stock prices for cotton shares rather than export values. In certain months, I was unable to find any &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; tables. I am unsure why this is, since this table should appear at least once per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While checking the 2 repeated tables, I found that the table printed on January 2, 1906 is exactly the same as the one printed in December of 1905. This shows that the table does not change at the beginning of a new month, but rather somewhere in the middle. In January 1906, this change happened on the 11th. However, as the &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table does not appear every single day, it is difficult to ascertain if there is a set day where the table changes each month or if it is random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interpreting-the-data&#34;&gt;Interpreting the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I proofed and corrected those 12 tables, I ran the same query and used only the values from the first table listed each month to create the following visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph shows a yearly trend where exports spike in December and reach their lowest points around June or July. In the fall, there is another small spike and fall. The steady climb in exports from fall to December can be explained by &lt;a href=&#34;https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT86200445/PDF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cotton maturation cycles&lt;/a&gt;. In both Upper and Lower Egypt, fall is the season for cotton harvesting. The &lt;strong&gt;cotn01&lt;/strong&gt; table for any given month supplies cotton export numbers for the month previous. So, since November marks the end of the cotton harvest, a sharp decrease in exports is expected in January. (December would display sales for November, and January would show counts for December.) In a post entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-grieco/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluctuation in Egyptian Cotton Exports Throughout the Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dante Grieco speculates that “a domestic policy in England” may also contribute to yearly cotton export trends, given the overwhelming presence of Britain in export numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lord-cromers-reports&#34;&gt;Lord Cromer’s Reports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/anti.12216&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;certain secondary sources&lt;/a&gt;, the cotton worm was said to have devastated the cotton crop in the late 1800s and early 1900s. However, the data given in &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; produces a very stable-looking trend line, factoring in seasonal changes, from the end of 1904 to the middle of 1907. To reconcile this apparently disparate information, I turned to Lord Evelyn Baring Cromer’s yearly &lt;em&gt;“Reports…on the Finances, Administration, and Condition of Egypt and the Soudan.”&lt;/em&gt; Lord Cromer’s annual report in 1905 (detailing events from 1904) mentions the cotton worm and suggests new policies to combat its effects. Unfortunately, the repository of &lt;em&gt;The Digital Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; does not include enough information from 1904 to provide context of cotton exports prior to 1905. (Meaning, it is difficult to visualize how the trendline would have differed.) Lord Cromer’s report from 1907 (detailing the events of 1906) is quite optimistic. In 1905, the return of corvée, which had previously been vanquished by the touted benevolence of British supervision, brought young boys en masse to the cotton fields to handpick infested leaves. State-mandated labor, combined with excellent weather and rainfall, strengthened the cotton crops in 1906. Although less land was dedicated to cotton-growing than in previous years, Lord Cromer was confident that the yield would be significantly larger. This fact is reflected in the graph above, in which peak monthly cotton exports in 1906 exceeded those of the same season in 1905 by nearly 40,000 bales. While a larger raw data source would be useful in visualizing the tumultuous period in Egypt before and during World War I, existing data paints a picture which compliments both primary and secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cotton Production In Relation To Average Temperature in Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-simmers/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-simmers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Temperature and Cotton production are tied together at a fundamental level. This is because temperature is a key component of agriculture, due to plants growing better in different climates. However, when looking at Egypt, their climatic tendencies have to be taken care of. These include temperatures ranging from “115 degrees F.” to “40 degrees F.” &lt;a href=&#34;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.a0010953297&amp;amp;view=1up&amp;amp;seq=50&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. Cotton needs specific temperatures to grow well, those being around 70 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Seedlings can be stunted by heat, thus causing smaller cotton bulbs. Smaller bulbs mean less total cotton being produced. Because of this, temperature has a huge effect on cotton exports and, therefore, temperature has a huge effect on global economy. Because the Egyptian Gazette was produced during the shift from industrial times to a more information-based era, textile production was a huge factor in the global economy. It was also one of Egypt’s more important exports, again showing the importance of temperature in terms of the Egyptian cotton market and the global cotton market. Changes in the global cotton market directly affected the people of Egypt since it was their primary export, meaning most of their money comes from it. Thereby, lots of crop means lots of money for the country. Lots of money for the country eventually gets to the people, meaning more money for the people and a better standard of living, resulting in higher GDP and better livelihoods. Because of this, temperature should be vastly important to the wellbeing of Egypt due to its relation to cotton production.&lt;/p&gt;

      Cotton
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart shows the average number of bales of cotton produced from January to December in Alexandria from 1905 to 1907. The peaks of bales produced were in January, May, and August, while the lowest dips are in March and September. January has an inordinately huge peak at around one million bales produced while the next highest month only has around six-hundred-thousand bales produced. Either this is correct or data from the Egyptian Gazette has been incorrectly computed or entered, resulting in this large peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation between cotton production and temperature is somewhat hard to understand in individual graphs. It takes around six months for a cotton crop to reach maturity and be reaped. Because of this, one has to look six months back to see what months affected that particular crop of cotton. Because of this, I will be looking at the peaks in the cotton crop and see how they correspond to the average max and min temperature. For January, that means the temperatures from the month of July had the most impact on cotton growth. These temperatures ranged from just above 30 degrees Celsius to around 20 degrees Celsius, meaning the cotton grows best in higher temperatures. The lowest recorded number of bales produced happened to be in March, so the corresponding month is September, which has similar temperatures to July. Therefore, it could be deduced that temperature has little affect on the production of cotton. Instead, some other environmental factor(s) has a great affect on cotton production. However, when compared to current average temperatures, changes in climate can be found, thereby supporting or denying climate change and its inherent effects on the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Mining and the Gold Market:To What Extent does the Nile Valley Gold Company Reflect the Gold Market?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-mendez/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-mendez/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran the XPath query: //div[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-el-reut01&amp;quot;]/table//cell[contains(.,&#39;Nile Valley Gold Mine&#39;)]/following-sibling::cell/measure. This search gave back 349 items, which were just the share prices, which ranged from 2 5/8 to 3/8. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/24138582&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;According to David McMahon, who analyzed an Egyptian geological map, the gold was extracted mainly from the Wadi Hammamat region&lt;/a&gt;. This is a dry river bed around the Nile river, and was a major trading and mining route. The Nile Valley Gold mine was part of this trading route, and it was on the most direct path to the Red sea. This means that a lot of traffic went by these mines and trading posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was extracted using regular expressions in the Atom text editor, and then put into an excel spreadsheet. In Tableau, I added a filter to exclude outlier values that were not accurate. I the proceeded to exclude the values that were in the templates (1.125, 1.25, 1). This made the visualization seem like a more accurate picture of what the actual data reflects. In almost all issues, The Nile Valley Gold company has &lt;em&gt;(New)&lt;/em&gt; next to it. This is because gold mining on a big scale was just beginning in Egypt.  &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://raregoldnuggets.com/?p=1850&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gold mining in the recent past has been on and off until 2009 when the Egyptian government gave out licenses to international partners to do the exploration in the eastern districts. For example, mining was done between 1902 and 1927 when it stopped until 1935 when it started again and then stopped in 1958.&amp;quot; &lt;/a&gt; This can explain the data I gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what the Egyptian Gazette said about the gold market, so I ran a basic search of the repository for mentions of gold in a paragraph. I found an interesting article talking about the demand of gold domestically and abroad. In the third of January of 1905, it says:
&amp;quot;all countries which have debts held in large amounts abroad, the natives
begin to buy back those debts as soon as they advance in prosperity. Egypt,
apparently, is doing this now. In the second place, it relieves the London
market from one drain for gold. True, gold shipments after the turn of the
year will not cause as much inconvenience as they would have caused during
the past two or three months. Still it is well that the demand for the metal
from abroad should decline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, we can deduce that a lot of gold is being shipped abroad. This is because of debts owed to other countries. However, the extent to which the demand for gold decreased is unknown. A conclusion cannot be drawn from the price of the gold stocks, as there are many factors that play into the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_15762724613630/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visualized data, interestingly, shows a downward trend, as the value of gold goes from 2.625 in January of 1905 to .25 in August of the same year. The price doesn&#39;t seem to recover. This could be due to many things. However, I believe that people were optimistic about the company at first, but then the company did not do well. New companies tend to carry a lot of risk, and have the possibility of failing. I wanted to know if the company did end up failing, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spink.com/lot/17016000072&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;found a certificate of a share of the company at an auction.&lt;/a&gt; This certificate indicates that the share was selling for £1, indicating that the price did end up stabilizing somewhat. However, I can find no mention of the company beyond 1912. This suggests that either the other mining companies were more prominent and important, or that the company did not succeed as other companies were already mining the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that there is European presence in Egypt in the early Twentieth century. This is seen in advertisements, articles, and even the stocks and shares list. The Nile Valley Gold mine was run, presumably, by the British. It is, after all, valuated in Euros. A lot of mines were opened in the wake of the 1900s. &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.openedition.org/cdf/5241?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Their openings date from the early twentieth century at a time when the Eastern Desert experienced renewed interest and when British mining companies explored the ancient sites&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; During this time there was also a growing interest on Ancient Egyptian history, and historians found various tombs decorated with gold. This, along with the large deposits of gold along the Nile river, led to great innovations in the gold mining sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Nile Valley Gold company is but one company and does not give a clear indication of the gold market in Egypt. However, it does give insight on the popular trading spots, and how large scale gold mining became popular in Egypt around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Horse Racing in 1907</title>

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horse racing in Egypt during the early 1900s appeared to be an interesting sport of study to me. It included my interest in sports that I shared with the rest of my group. As for the reason why I specifically chose this, it was because I reasoned that horse back racing must have been quite popular during those times which would make for an equally enjoyable and manageable form of study. While looking through the text, it is evident that they do not officially play sports like we do here in the U.S. today. For instance, they do not take many things into consideration, such as variable handicaps as well as the weights of the actual people riding the horse. This is rather quite important considering a horse is not a car. Why these matter is because even in professional race car drivers, just being a leaner individual allows your car to effectively lose drag. This is somewhat negligible in say a street race but is practically essential in races that use very accurate and miniscule readings such as milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To relate this back to the topic at hand, the race time tracking that take place in Egypt at that time are vastly inferior. This leads me to believe that they either have an understandable technological disadvantage or that they treat this as a mostly recreational/ semi professional event. I could possibly conclude, however, that it is a recreational event simply when looking at the time intervals between each race. The races all take place within roughly 30 minutes of each other. This does not allow any time for proper cleaning, shoveling of road, or any other professional changes done to ensure that it stays consistent through each race. Curiously enough, the audience also does not seem to value variety. This is seen when looking at how formulaic the text in the newspaper is. It follows the same pattern each race and even includes the same words about how, “Arab ponies have never won a race of any value.” This stagnation is even seen in the types of horses they use. Consistently as they put it, the Arab horses do not win, by quite a significant margin. In fact, most times it is the Galloway horses that triumph as they are the pure-bred ones. With these in mind, it does not seem as though they are trying to attract newer audiences or even change anything as the formula persists throughout months and years. Instead, it seems to have a following that much like its formula seems to remain largely unchanged as time goes by. Which leads me to the first weakness of this topic.
As with anything that pertains to history, there is an innate issue with accuracy here. It is hard to determine whether this formula was made on purpose and is made that way for ease of reading throughout the multiple issues that this takes place, or if instead the writers simply did not want to creatively document it differently from issue to issue. Regardless of the reason, this makes it hard for a student to gather up his data simply due to the unusualness in how this data is presented. Likewise, prize pools can be systematically repeated throughout races as well. This adds another formulaic variable that makes this sport seem rather dull on the surface. In this sense, if a student were to look at this only through what is written on the newspaper, the sport would not look interesting enough to warrant even a second reading from a different issue and would beg the question why someone would not just guess their own results. Especially when there is quite frankly an 100% certainty that indeed the Arab pony will not win the day.
With this being said, there are still some differences between the races. Such as the names of the races themselves. Though they follow the same standard naming schemes of “plates”, they still do have different types of plates depending on the months/seasons they are raced in. Likewise, the prize pool variates in correspondence with the plate names.
When looking at the May 1905 races we see that there is a lot more at stake here. It practically dwarfs the others in terms of monetary value in the first and second place prize earnings. Likewise, it seems that in July 1905 there was a very significant drop-off in the prize earnings. It went from about 60k to just under 10k. This may be due to a reduction in the prize earnings due to popularity or simply could be because of less overall races. Luckily I have this data and interestingly enough, they both have the same races. It is 6 for both, meaning July was really just a year that awarded a lot less money for first place This is consistent even when compared with other dates. However, Monday is still an anomaly since it greatly exceeds any other prize offerings from the other months. The months of March 1906, October 1906, and July 1907 are what I would consider to be very average months. They have nothing special between any of them in terms of prize pools for both first and second place. This leads me to believe that May 1905, October 1905,  and February 1907 are the strange ones in terms of the prize earnings. This is not too surprising however, since it did not seem like quite a popular sport as it was mostly amateurish and very formulaic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Economic History of Stocks and Shares</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-stocks/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-stocks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;identifying-data-sets-bailee&#34;&gt;Identifying Data Sets: Bailee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group was primarily focused on the section of the Egyptian Gazette called Stocks and Shares, a table listing various companies and the prices of their respective shares. The companies are divided into various sections such as “banks,” “land,” “commercial/industrial,” “navigation &amp;amp; water works,” and “railways and tramways.” To select specific companies to analyze within each industry, I looked for one or two companies whose shares were listed in pounds (for ease of comparison- though it would be possible to convert from one type of currency to another, it was simpler this way), then picked the companies with the highest share prices. Choosing one or two companies with the highest share prices seemed like one possible way to find companies who were dominating those industries and could therefore provide an accurate assessment of Alexandria’s economy during a specific time period. The following eight companies were selected from those criteria: Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Fond., Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref., pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord., Alex. Water Company, Cairo-Helouan, and Keneh-Assouan. (For clarity, these names were lifted directly from the tables in question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-the-datasource-alvin&#34;&gt;Introducing the Datasource: Alvin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the selection of the eight companies above, we found that those companies can be distinguished into two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them is finance, which includes Imperial Ottoman Bank, National Bank of Egypt, New Daira Sanieh Found, Alexandria Bounded Stores Pref, and Keneh-Assouan (Assurance). It is apparent that bank, insurance, and estate companies are likely to have more influence on the stock market, so we choose to observe them from a micro-scale, and then link them to the macroeconomics of Egypt. For instance, &lt;a href=&#34;http://psi424.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Pamuk,%20Evolution%20of%20Financial%20Institutions,%201600-1914%20%282004%29.PDF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ottoman Bank&lt;/a&gt; helped foreign interest groups to have their investments in Egypt. Its shares consisted of thousands of English Group and French Group. It also functioned as a loan provider by issuing loans to the government of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that the investors and businessmen in Egypt needed to borrow loans to develop and establish their industries to the emerging economics boom at the start of the 1900s. In return, the consumers and investors built up their credits and deposited their revenues to the bank, which allows the bank to have more power to promote regional development. As the economy boomed, the values of land prices increased. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.egy.com/historica/97-07-00.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daira Sanieh&lt;/a&gt;  was a sugar company, and it also held many lands in North Egypt. During the booming, its lands were brought by several foreign investors. It used to have about 4 million Para (Ottoman Turkish currency) debt. After the sale of lands, its debt was paid off. On the sides of that, insurance companies had roles in decreasing the risk of the investors in the financial system and preventing the cost when companies have defaulted or failed to obligate the promise of paying back loans. Meanwhile, insurance companies hold &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272305139_Egyptian_Insurance_Market_History_and_Structure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;large shares&lt;/a&gt; from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second category is the infrastructure. In this project, we include Cairo Sewage Transport., Alexandria Water Company, and Cairo Helouan. In two decades, from 1880 to 1900, the population of Egypt had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/568/mode/2up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;exponential growth&lt;/a&gt;. The population in Alexandria grew half the amount of what it had in 1882. In 1907, it had 332,246 in Cairo. With the growth of population, more water installments and more transportation were needed to support the cities’ operation. The water was primarily relied on Suez and Niles. In major cities like Cairo and Alexandria, they had many railroads and tram companies serving for passengers and freight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-of-obtaining-preliminary-values-pre-correction-bailee&#34;&gt;Process of Obtaining Preliminary Values Pre-Correction: Bailee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to collect values from these companies, I ran the following XPath query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=”deg-el-stsh01”]/table//cell[contains(.,’Imperial Ottoman Bank’)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular query would deliver the share price (in pounds) for the Imperial Ottoman Bank in each properly labeled Stocks and Shares table within the content repository. (For reference, I updated my version of the content repository on November 13, 2019 at approximately 11 am.) I then took the search results and used Atom to isolate only the dates and share prices, then pasted them as separate columns in an Excel document.
To obtain values from the other companies, I simply replaced the blue text with another company’s name and followed the same process. In this way, the XPath query for, say, Cairo Sewage Transport Ord. would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=&amp;ldquo;deg-el-stsh01&amp;rdquo;]/table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;pref. Cairo Sewage Transport Ord.&amp;rsquo;)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the query &lt;strong&gt;//div[@xml:id=”deg-el-stsh01”]&lt;/strong&gt; showed 175 ocurrences of the Stocks and Shares table within the content repository. However, we had to determine whether the data shown was correct or if it was simply the templated information. So, we decided to restrict to a smaller sample size of data that we could plausibly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period of time that we chose was the year 1905, as the XPath query I ran seemed to show that editions from 1905 had the most complete data sets (perhaps because IDS classes are working on this newspaper in chronological order). Of all the companies listed, Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref., a commercial/industrial company, had the most results in 1905 (94 results). However, 94 tables would be too many for us to check (plausibly). So, we decided to use data only from Wednesdays as a sample. In order to isolate data from Wednesday editions, I imported values corresponding to Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref. in 1905 to Tableau. I set “weekdays” of dates as columns and “count” of the values to find how many of the values came from which day of the week. The largest number of values for Alexandria Bonded Stores Pref. (18 values) were present in Wednesday editions. Tableau confuses me still, so I just used a calendar from 1905 to find out which dates were Wednesdays after figuring out that Wednesdays held the largest data pool. After further research, we found that Wednesday’s stocks and shares data would experience the &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.zacks.com/day-week-volatile-stock-market-3009.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;least volatility&lt;/a&gt; given its placement exactly between market open and market close in the available trading days throughout any given week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-short-aside-on-correction-austin&#34;&gt;A Short Aside on Correction: Austin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dates that I was supposed to research based on our query were the following: &lt;strong&gt;3/8/1905&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;3/15&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;3/22&lt;/strong&gt;. The first thing to note was that the query was pretty accurate, albeit it still had some problems. Problems not on our end, but flawed issues based on the fact that our repository that we were basing our working sets on were made by other students/people. For the 3/15 chart, I had to figure out why the xml work was showing it was on page six but the image didn’t include it. I had to look through the other pages and found out that it didn’t exist for the date. For the 3/22 table, it was correct but just on a different page than where it was on the source file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-visualization-process-jimmy&#34;&gt;The Visualization Process: Jimmy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the excel document Bailee made, I opened a Tableau document and imported the data. I first had to include filters because a lot of the data was from the template. The data still may have not been accurate, so as a group we decided to use a sample and manually change the data. Because of the small data sample, the graphs of the stocks look more rigid and a lot don’t move over the course of the year. However, there are interesting jumps here and there in the data. Also, I decided to use the excel visualization platform for the final graphs because it is more intuitive for me. These visualizations include companies in different industries, such as banks, land, commercial industrial, navigation and waterworks, and railways. The National Bank of Egypt seems to have the most dynamic movement, while the Imperial Ottoman Bank hardly moves at all. There seems to be a jump in the prices of bank stocks in January of 1906. However, at the same time the Daira Sanieh stock seems to drop and so does the Alexandria Water company. Whether or not it is in any way correlated remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-austin&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Austin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the dates are such a small sample size, the difference in share prices were minuscule so I decided to focus more solely on a very important stock at the time and even now for the country of Egypt. During the early 1900’s, Egypt was going through an economic crisis and were in the middle of rebuilding their economy as the British had taken over after the war in 1882. The British made it their goal to pool resources into Egypts economy and this is why the National Bank of Egypt, the oldest and biggest bank in Egypt was able to recover and even have steady stock growth all throughout 1905 and into 1906. Another thing to note is that the tables show debentures and the National Bank of Egypt did not issue any throughout 1905 and this can indicate that the bank was a secure investment and backed by reliable assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final point of this project was to see how the financial markets were doing and using this as an evaluation of how the economy in Egypt was during the time period of 1905. The main reason we as a group were trying to find the answer to this question is because Egypt was suffering from a declining economy and after the war of 1882, where the British took over, they made rebuilding Egypt’s economy a priority. The latter reason is that Egypt went through a major recession in the year of 1907 and on, and we wanted to see how stabilized the markets were prior. As we can see from our charts, many of the top performing stocks were either on a clear uptrend or were stabilized around a certain price, indicating that Egypt’s economy was quite strong during 1905.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polo in Egypt: An Attendance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-faynberg/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-faynberg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What first comes to mind when hearing the term “polo”? Is it a horse? A grassy field? A shirt worn to a somewhat formal occasion? While the term is indeed applicable for all three of these, for the purpose of this analysis I will focus on the Polo relating to the first two. By this I am referring to one of the oldest sports to still be played today. Polo is a team sport where four members of each team mount their horses and, with mallets in hand, strive to direct a ball between a set of goal posts. The game is divided into four to six periods called “chukkers” lasting 7 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the horseback sport can be traced back to Central Asia as early as 600 B.C. These nomads originated a variation of the game including teams with as many as 100 men to a side, with the main purpose of the sport being military training. After the nomads migration into Persia, polo became a national sport and its popularity blossomed. The invention of modern polo can be credited to British tea planters in Manipur, India, establishing the first polo club known as The Silchar Polo Club. This foundation set in 1859 quickly spread across Europe, becoming popular in Malta, England, and Ireland within a short period of time after its genesis. Polo became a very popular activity for militaries, especially once the game found its way to the United States for its ability to improve the riding skills of cavalrymen, teach leadership qualities, and develop camaraderie among troops. A further history of the sport can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polomuseum.com/sport-polo/history-polo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
The Egyptian Gazette highlights the sport quite often and it is without a doubt one of the more popular sports in the region. The Gazette makes reference to 12 teams over the span of 1906-1908 as well as four tournaments. My analysis project is set to discover which of these teams produce the greatest amount of “interesting games” as I would like to call them as well as if there is a relation to the amount of interesting games a team has to the spectator turnout for that team’s polo match. I will also be looking into the attendance for each of the four Major tournaments the Gazette reports on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-methodology&#34;&gt;Step 1: Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this project, I set out to discover which team creates the most amount of what I like to call “interesting games.” I have classified these as games where the final score pins the teams within two goals of each other. For example, games ending 3-1 or 3-2 would be considered interesting. However, games ending 3-0, 4-1, etc. would not be classified as “interesting games.” Also, I did not include tie games into my “interesting games” category despite being within the two goal margin. A widespread opinion in modern sports culture is that tie games can ruin great events and I do believe in this to an extent. Therefore, for the purpose of this study they will not be included. While looking at which teams created the most interesting games, I plan on showing my results with the total amount of games played by each team to see the ratio of games played by a specific team resulting in “interesting games” to total games.
Next, I will be looking into which teams gathered how many spectators. The Gazette often reports the amount of spectators, however I noticed it mostly mentions the crowd during tournament events and not single match friendlies. Hence why there will be more reported scores in my analysis than reported attendances. In this analysis, I will scale the attendance on a point based system giving 0.5 points for a “fair” crowd, 1.0 point for a “large” crowd, and 1.5 points for a “very large” crowd, while giving 0 points for events where attendance was failed to be reported. This will be known as a team’s “Attendance Score.” With the number of interesting games and Attendance score acquired, I will then compare the two to see 1. Which team provides the greatest quantity of interesting games, 2. Which team gathers the greatest amount of spectators, and 3. Is there a correlation between these two variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will use the same method as I did to find Attendance Scores for independent teams as I will for the major events, giving each event their own Attendance Score. I will then divide this by the maximum number of points possible to provide more accurate results. I will do this for if an event is shown for example 10 times in the newspaper and garners a 5 attendance score, than it will be evenly compared with another event shown 5 times that finishes with a score of 2.5. Despite, 5&amp;gt;2.5, the adjusted attendance score would conclude the two events to be equal in drawn attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-querying&#34;&gt;Step 2: Querying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis resulted in two main query searches. Unfortunately, many of the authors of prior deliverables used different headings in their ‘div’ sections, with some not making the polo section its own ‘div’ all together. Therefore, I used the query //div[@type=&amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo;][contains(., &amp;ldquo;chukker&amp;rdquo;)] to search out all dates where there was a reported score for a match. I used the term chukker for each it appears every time there is a reported score in the Gazette. After using this, I manually transferred the teams and scores into an excel document, for there was no uniform way the Gazette reported scores and thus making it almost impossible to make a specific query to target the scores. I also took note of any mention of spectators during this search. My second query served as a backup to my first to find any additional reports of a polo score. Within the Gazette, the team roster is most often mentioned and can be transferred into oxygen by use of a table. One of the players on the team is noted as ‘back’ identifying him as a defensive type player. This term back often appears in a cell within a table and therefore I used the query //table//cell[contains(.,’back’)] to find these tables and see if any reported scores not found in the first query pop up here. Surely enough, I was able to find 6 additional dates with reported scores.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4-analysis&#34;&gt;Step 4: Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were twelve teams identified by my query. The Tourists, 60th Rifles, Freebooters, The Mosquitos, Egyptian Army, K.S.C., Inniskilling Dragoons, Coldstream Guards, K.O.S.B, Civilians, Capt. Bartlett&amp;rsquo;s Team, and Staff and Departmental. After running my test and plugging my data into Tableau, the first table shows a stacked bar graph comparing the total amount of games played per team to the amount classified as “interesting.” As seen in the graph, the Inniskilling Dragoons lead the way by means of “interesting games”, followed closely by Egyptian Army and Coldstream Guards. Interestingly enough, the Coldstream Guards lead the group in total games played yet rank third. Less than half of their games played were classified as ‘interesting.’ The Freebooters played only 3 games, however all of their matches can be deemed interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting to the second visualization, where I look at Attendance Scores for each team, Inniskilling Dragoons once again lead the charge followed by Coldstream Guards. However, Egyptian army seems to have fallen off for its Attendance score ranks 7th among the 12 teams. Staff and Departmental while only playing 5 games managed to rank third in this category. K.O.S.B and K.S.C both ranked the same in the amount of “Interesting Games”, however, K.S.C finished much higher in Attendance score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third visualization is what I deem to be the most important of the bunch as it shows if there is any connection between the two variables. The upward sloping line of best fit does conclude that despite the small sample size, there indeed seems to be a direct relation between the two, with an increase in teams that play interesting games result in a greater turnout of spectators.
Shifting away from individual teams and into the major events, there are four that the Gazette reports: The Gordon Cup, The Junior Polo Championship, The Polo Cup, and the Open Cup. The fourth visualization shows total attendance per major event and has the Gordon Cup leading the way. The fifth visualization takes this statistic and adjusts it for the maximum amount of potential points. For example, if an event was reported three times, then the maximum points would be 4.5. If the reported Attendance score was 3, then the efficiency score would be .66. This bar graph shows a more accurate result than the fourth, resulting in the Polo Cup drawing the biggest number of spectators per match, surpassing the Gordon cup. This conclusion leads me to believe if both the Gordon Cup and Polo Cup were reported and equal amount of times, the Polo cup would achieve a higher attendance score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-5-conclusion&#34;&gt;Step 5: Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all of this, what does it all mean and is there any significant value to this analysis? The short answer is yes, there is significant value. While being very limited in the quantity of analyzed attendances, there is an upward trend between the two variables. An important conclusion that could be considered is the fact that the newspaper serves as a medium of information for these games, and for readers of these newspapers, seeing exciting matchups between teams may entice residents to go out and see these teams perform. It is difficult to find a connection between these numbers and the economy for these were not regulated by any governing association. A further study could investigate the formation of rivalries between squads as I noticed a few matchups appeared much more than others such as the Coldstream Guards and K.S.C. playing the most head to head games at four. These rivalries could also be compared to attendances later down the line when the game is better regulated for I know present day professional sport teams draw bigger crowds when a big rivalry is in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to note a possibility for error in my analysis. There were only 25 reported matches over the span of three years, which seems very low, as well as attendance numbers only showing up during tournament dates rather than single match friendlies. With more data, the trend line could be shifted and therefore alter my conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of Seasonal Change On Tourism and Hotel Stays</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-rivera/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-rivera/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years 1905, 1906, and 1907 in Egypt, there was a visible fluctuation in the number of individuals staying at various hotels, such as the Luxor Winter Palace, Cataract Hotel Assouan, and the Savoy Hotel Assouan. Seasonal changes, as well as the environmental changes that come with change in season, greatly affect aspects such as traveling and tourism throughout each year. According to the meteorological dates for seasons, the start of each season remains the same, however the end of each season changes slightly each year depending on how many days there are in the month. According to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.almanac.com/content/first-day-seasons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Online Almanac&lt;/a&gt;, Spring starts March 1st and ends around May 31st, Summer starts June 1st and ends around August 31st, Fall starts September 1st and ends around November 30th, and Winter starts December 1st and ends around February 29th. I utilized the meteorological dates for the seasons because this website states that these dates are &amp;ldquo;based on the annual temperature cycle and the 12-month calendar.” This website also mentions that “climate scientists and meteorologists created this definition to make it easier to keep records of the weather, since the start of each meteorological season doesn’t change from year to year.” The meteorological dates are most useful for this research because the start of each season starts the same day no matter what year and these dates exist strictly for weather data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildland.com/destinations/middle-east/egypt/seasonsclimate.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wildland Adventures&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt’s main seasons are Winter and Summer, Egypt’s Winters are typically cold, windy, humid, and sometimes rainy whereas Egypt’s Summers are very dry, with very high temperatures. This website also states that the months April, May, October, and November are especially good for travelling. These reported most popular months for tourism fall in the seasons of Fall and Spring. With the data collected through an XPath Query, three line graphs and a series of bar graphs were created, demonstrating what months experienced more stays in hotels, which can be tied to tourism and how environment and seasons can affect travel in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visually represent the number of individuals staying in hotels in Alexandria throughout the years 1905, 1906, and 1907, I used a specific XPath Query, organized my findings into Excel documents, and imported these Excel documents into Tableau. The data I collected was derived from using the XPath Query &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;visitList&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; and searching specifically for commas in this feature to detect all of the commas present in each listing of the Visitor’s List because the Visitor’s List feature provides all hotel visitor names separated by commas. This XPath Query is not one hundred percent correct and only provides estimates, since often in these features a husband and wife along with their shared last name are included before one single comma. Using this XPath Query allowed me to detect estimates of the quantities of individuals staying in hotels throughout each year. After collecting the quantities from each year, I transferred them into three separate Excel documents so that they could later be uploaded to Tableau. In addition to the the three line graphs separated by year, I have also created a visualization, separated by year and month, of the averages of the number of individuals staying in hotels throughout each month of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I uploaded each of the three Excel documents into Tableau, I was able to create three separate line graphs that demonstrate the number of individuals residing in hotels in Egypt. To make these line graphs even more accurate, I recorded every instance in which there was a list of names in the Visit List feature. Since I recorded every appearance of this feature, I was able to label each specific date and number of commas on the line graph to make it easier to visualize the beginning and end of seasons. By looking at all four of the visualizations, I can state that the months January, February, March, and December seem to be the months that experienced the most tourism and populated hotels. The seasons that these months fall in are Winter and Spring. The months that experienced the least number of individuals staying in hotels were August, October, and November. This data proves the &amp;ldquo;Wildland Adventures&amp;rdquo; article wrong because they stated that the most popular months for tourism in Egypt are April, May, October, and November, where in reality the most popular months were actually January, February, March and December. By looking at what months that article thought were most active, I was able to deduce that they believed the most popular tourism seasons to be Fall and Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heat of the Sun [May 1906-April 1907]</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of climate change on the environment has been something of great controversy and debate in the media. This uncertainty regarding the topic sparked an interest in our group and that was to find the validity of these claims. Our ability to gather different aspects of the weather and relate them to each other was crucial in reaching the results that were acquired. In this project, the main goal is to analyze the weather and heat of the sun in Egypt from May 1906 to April 1907. The subcategories chosen will allow us to see what the impact of the heat of the sun is on subjects such as state of clouds, humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures. Most importantly, we are trying to deduce how all of these factors affect the living conditions in the country of Egypt. The main questions that will be answered is how the heat of the sun varies from May 1906 to April 1907 and how this impacts the humidity, state of clouds, average temperature of Alexandria, and maximum and minimum temperatures in other stations.  The information needed to reach our results will be gathered from the Xpath Queries that will be listed below. This information will then be presented in a bar graph created in Tableau that shows the average heat of the sun monthly and will be compared to the other aspects that affect the climate to see which one plays the largest role. From this visualization we will be able to determine the significance of the data gathered and whether the heat of the sun and other factors of climate are connected in some way or another. Lastly, the results will be placed in historical context to see the importance of the results gathered and whether or not they are supported by the articles we have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xpath-query&#34;&gt;XPath Query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my query, I wanted to pick something that yielded good enough results regarding the Heat of the Sun measures in which we can properly use it in our research, so we&amp;rsquo;ve come up with this. XPath Query: &lt;code&gt;//table[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-ta-dawr01&amp;quot;]/row[matches(.,&#39;heat of the sun&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/cell[2]/measure/text()&lt;/code&gt;. In my query, I am limiting the results to only include those from the Daily Weather Report table, as with its corresponding ID. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve restricted it to the daily weather report, I needed to restrict it further to just the heat of the sun which I did here. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in some of the issues that some people capitalize the phrase &amp;ldquo;Heat of the sun&amp;rdquo; in various ways, so I made it case insensitive with the matches command. This query yielded 120 items, a lot more than what I had expecting and enough results for me to use research on however there were some discrepancies. In the earlier years, 1905 to mid-1906, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many holes and the data was pretty dense however as I began looking at the results past that, the data begins to thin out, making it hard to use the data. There are many different reasons why this might be. As ironic as it sounds, maybe the &amp;lsquo;Daily Weather Report&amp;rsquo; never actually reported daily, or the students that had the days in which the data was missing never did them, there are several possibilities. As a result, I needed to restrict the timeframe of my research. My initial intent was to explore the heat of the sun index across all years however the data given made it near impossible to do that. Because of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to restrict it to 1 year, where the data works best in and that was from May 1905 to April 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization&#34;&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have my query results, I needed to take my results and make a visualization out of it. Because my data was dense in my specified timeframe, doing an average of each month was the best thing to do in order to give a visualization of what my data represents as the sample size was large enough to accurately depict the indexes for each month. After putting the results in a spreadsheet, transferring it to Tableau, and averaging the measures per its corresponding month I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

      Initial Bar Graph of Heat of the Sun Averages for each month.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the visualization here is good, as it gives a good initial representation of the heat of the sun averages for each month, as you can tell the graph spikes in October 1906 and sinks in December 1906. As a result, I began to find out why this is happening and noticed that it was an error in the data source. In one of the days for October, the measure was 452, blowing the average way out of proportion. Likewise, with December, a day had a measure of 8, lowering the average. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t too big of a deal as we are only dealing with averages. Simply excluding the two days with the incorrect measures is all I needed to do in order to make the graph accurately representable of what we are trying to research, so that is what I did. After doing this, the graph looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Revised Bar Graph of Heat of the Sun Averages for each month.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, the data flows much better as the months go by. The visualization almost depicts a sinusoidal function as time goes by, where the averages of the heat of the sun peaks in the summer months and flows smoothly until it troughs into the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;significance-of-the-data&#34;&gt;Significance of the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Daily Weather Report” in the “Egyptian Gazette” gives readers information about the weather for the upcoming day. There are many different columns which describe various sections that relate to the weather like humidity, force of the anemometer, maximum and minimum temperatures, and most importantly, heat of the sun. When looking at the heat of the sun data, it is clear that there is significance behind it. The topic itself is odd; when we look at the weather forecast these days, there is no “heat of the sun” column. We focus on the maximum and minimum temperature for the day and if necessary, the probability of rain. Thus, this begs the question as to why readers of the “Egyptian Gazette” would want to know the heat of the sun for every single day. One reason for this may be that readers would want to know how the sun is heating the earth. The heat of the sun and the temperature are two different thing; the heat of the sun demonstrates how much the sun is heating up the earth, while the temperature shows how hot or cold it is on a specific day. The heat from the sun tends to stay in the ground for a while, and the more sun exposure that the earth gets, the warmer the earth feels. When looking at our data from May 1906 to April 1907, one can tell that the heat of the sun fluctuates throughout the course of the year. The graph shows steady growth during the summer months, reaches its peak during July, and eventually evens out when it comes to the winter and spring months.  Looking at this graph, one can see that the heat of the sun was significantly  higher during fall and summer when compared to the winter and spring months. Particularly, the heat of the sun measures do not start to decline until October and November, two months not commonly known for their excessive heat. However, it can be determined that the reason behind this, is because the earth is moving away from the sun, but all of the heat is still left over from the summer months. It is like how the longest day of the year occurs during the summer solstice, but the hottest day occurs during end of July and early August.  This data is significant because it gives readers a better insight into the heat of the sun in Alexandria, Egypt from 1906-1907. Not a ton of research is published that shows how the heat of the sun changes during the early 1900’s. The “Egyptian Gazette” provides us and other readers or researchers with additional information that was recorded firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-context&#34;&gt;Historical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the group decides to dig deeper into the Egyptian Gazette issues, weather patterns around the country in the early 1900s make themselves pretty obvious. Although all that can be done on our half is make predictions about why that is so and how the future can be affected, there are luckily an abundance of secondary sources that use previously gathered weather data from parts of Egypt during this same time frame. A specific article that was found discusses the temperature change in the Nile Delta compared over three different eras: 1900-1947, 1950-1981, and 1982-2010. The article is linked &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303018027_Temperature_trend_over_Nile_Delta_Egypt_during_20th_Century&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for reference. It takes measurements from three of Egypt’s busiest ports, those being Cairo, Port Said, and the Port of Alexandria. A lot of the data that we found to exist in the newspaper issues goes along with the data provided in this article, which draws many interesting conclusions. In a historical sense, the winter of 1904 was a particularly dry season for Egypt in comparison to years past and prior. This means the transition into spring and summer would probably be more difficult with less moist soil, making it hard to harvest food. This would further explain the lack of ads included in the Egyptian Gazette issues during the spring months of 1904 because of the drought that occurred the winter prior. As technology advanced in cities like Alexandria, the question of how real global warming became popularized. People began to worry about how transportation would continue to make life more efficient, and how individuals would obtain shelter and food to feed their families with. The overall results concluded in the newspaper issues over time and other data surrounding similar topics found in primary sources test the validity of climate change on the state of Egypt. Correlating different components of Egypt’s climate with their personal statistics can tell the audience about what to expect for Egypt’s future and how to best prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-remarks&#34;&gt;Research Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing this research, there were a few remarks that I would like to point out regarding the accuracy of a given data element and how that can ultimately skew your research. Initially, as I began constructing my XPath Query, as I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed before, the data isn&amp;rsquo;t always perfect. The query did not yield results for every single day in all 3 years. The results were dense in the earlier years but as time went by, that data began to thin out, making it very difficult to pick apart data that can accurately represent what I am trying to research. Even though the data that was presented, yielded, some of the measures were wrong, due to human error. For me, as I was dealing with averages across each month, the human error threw my data visualization off-proportion, in which I had to change. I am by no means saying that these digital methods of acquiring data are bad. In fact, the ability to use a query to yield results from various newspapers over several years is very efficient. However, a weakness of researching through digital methods is that the data presented isn&amp;rsquo;t always accurate, questioning the validity and accuracy of the research itself. Furthermore, the data could be missing, also highlighting the inaccuracy of the data element.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Home Field Advantage in Football</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-reynolds/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every athlete loves to play on their home field, and it’s easy to see why. Being in front of their home fans, being on their most familiar field, and the overall convenience of home field has led to the common belief that the home team is at a measurable advantage. In the Egyptian Gazette, football (soccer) is one of the only sports with a distinct home and away team. For my individual analysis, I decided to explore this home and away data to answer the question: did home field advantage exist for football teams in early 1900’s Egypt, and why/why not?
In order to find this data, I used the same queries which I used in the group project. One of the queries I used was //head[matches(.,’sport and play’, ‘i’)][matches(.,&amp;rsquo;the plague&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)].  The purpose of these queries was to find every recorded football game possible in the newspaper. For each game I found, I recorded the issue date, home and away team, score, and attendance. Finding which teams were home or away seemed impossible at first, but I quickly realized that all of the recaps had the home team listed first. For example, if the section read “St. Andrew’s F.C. vs E.T.C. Suez,” it meant that St. Andrew’s F.C. was the home team.&lt;/p&gt;

      Every winning football team split by home and away
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

This double-layered pie chart displays the winning team of every recorded game, separated by home or away. I found that across every game that did not end in a tie, the home team won nearly 75% of the time, or almost 300% more than the away team. Teams like St. Andrew’s F.C., E.T.C. Suez, and the Boulac Railway Institute had the most success at home, as they are the only teams with multiple home wins. St. Andrew’s played in the greatest number of recorded matches, so it is not too unusual to see them with 6 home wins. On the away side of the chart, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers are the only to get more than one win on the road. However, this disparity goes beyond simple win/loss statistics.

This stacked bar chart shows the home and away scores of every recorded game, along with an overlaid line chart of every game’s margin of victory. It is clear that most of the graph lies above the x-axis, on the home side. The reference lines show us that the average score of all away teams was 1.1 goal per game, while the home teams averaged 2 goals, nearly twice as much scoring per game. The most goals and highest victory margin for an away team in a game were accomplished by the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers when they stomped the King’s Royal Rifles 5-0. Other than this game, there are a few away teams who have won by 2 or 3 goals, but the majority of away wins are by just 1 goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly is the reason for this seemingly enormous difference in home and away team performance? One reason could be the way that games are scheduled. In recreational sports leagues like this one, most of the time the better or at least more established teams are granted home field, while the worse or less known team must travel. This would mean that the home teams are almost always the better team before the game even starts. This explanation is plausible, but the data does not include any teams with much more home than away games. Another reason could be for the simple fact that players on the home team do not have to travel like the away players do. Depending on how far each game was, travelling to away games is inconvenient and can disrupt a player’s internal schedule or readiness. Home teams obviously do not travel, so they are able to rest, practice, or otherwise prepare during this time. Finally, this data disparity could also be due to the most common explanation for home field advantage: the fans. While this is certainly true for most major sporting events, these games were very recreational and did not have a huge number of spectators. Of the 13 games which recorded attendance, only five had over 2000 people, all of which were very anticipated games between prominent military units.
Rather than a single factor causing the home and away disparity, I believe that it is due to a combination of everything stated above. It is possible that while most teams played roughly the same number of home and away games, teams still scheduled easy games on their home field. I do not believe that simply traveling to another field could have such a large impact on its own, but it does have a perceivable effect and could easily play a role in this. Although there were relatively low numbers of attendance, over 1000 fans could definitely have an impact on the game’s outcome. However, as previously mentioned these are recreational competitions, meaning there probably are not over 1000 fans who care enough to get loud at most of the games. Overall, I believe that the massive difference in the performance of home and away teams is caused by a combination of home teams intentionally being better, away teams having to travel, and the home fans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Influx Results In Spikes</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-piraino/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-piraino/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My group’s analysis of the Egyptian Gazette is focused on the Stocks and Shares tables. These tables have a lot of information about the most popular and frequently relevant companies of Egypt at the time. These include many manufacturing, industrial companies, banks, steam ship companies, local businesses, railway and tramway companies, utility works and Government businesses. Of these many fluctuating representations, I&amp;rsquo;m am going to individually analyze the navigation transportation and Lodging companies and decipher their relevance to the stocks and shares tables. There is a great amount of Transportation services in Alexandria, Egypt. Like Anchor Line Limited, Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co., Deutsche Levante-Linnie, The Ellerman Lines, Limited, British India S. N. Company, Limited. The Moss S.S. Company, Ltd., Bibby Line Mail steamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By noting the amount of people that arrive and depart from different locations, I can get a nice look at how the population is changing. Then by checking the differing numbers in the lodging of Alexandria I can get a nice look at how many tourists are coming in and out of Alexandria, Egypt. Furthermore, by compiling these findings into a quarterly consensus to decide how the quarterly stocks and shares numbers will differ, this will make a nice conclusion as to how the amount of tourism during certain seasons will affect the fluctuation of certain Stocks and shares prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this I had to query a ton for quantifiable numbers. First, I queried for departures and arrivals to and from Alexandria, Egypt with the Anchor Line Limited, Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship Co., Deutsche Levante-Linnie, the Ellerman Lines Limited, British India S.N. Company Limited. Sudan Government Railway and Hamburg-Amerika Linie. I queried for the header of these companies’ names in page 1 results because that’s where I found the best results. These findings were compiled to depict that during the first and the fourth quarters of the year there are the most arrivals and departures. Where there are significantly more arrivals at the middle of November and the most departures at the end of March. I tried to conclude why this was the case and found that the prices of fares and tickets were a bit more expensive during these months, which makes sense. But what stood out the most was when I queried for the Daily Weather Report of these months and found that the weather was significantly more tourism appealing. During the months of December through March in Egypt the weather is Mediterranean like, with a cool temperature, windy at times and occasional rain, which makes for a beautiful tourist vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I queried for the tables under the header of a manufacturing company moving steamships with goods and services in the tons. I targeted headers like Prince Line and The Moss S.S. Company Limited during each quarter and found varying numbers for these as well that are evident of an increase in business for the first second and fourth quarters of the year. This is parallel to the influx of population during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when I look at the results of my group&amp;rsquo;s findings and visualizations of the Stocks and Shares tables with the supporting query results of the Transportation of people, movements of goods and lodging vacancies. I found that these are parallel to the fluctuation of Stocks and Shares. Although the Stocks and Shares tables do not vary that frequently at the spots where they are most fluctuating correspond to the influx of people and goods during the first and fourth quarter. These stocks and shares are generally flat and at about the beginning of November and January is when the values have a pretty volatile spike upward. Then at about the end of February the stocks and shares values start to drop back to where they were. All of the stocks and shares followed this trend almost precisely, not just the companies that my group chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making this analysis I would conclude that due to the ideal weather circumstances during the wintertime there is a mas influx of people coming in and out of Alexandria, Egypt. Because of this increased transportation it has caused a need for more goods and services to be transported in and exported as well. These marketing factors have led to a rise in Stocks and Shares values during the first and fourth quarters of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insurance vs Assurance</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-douglas/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-douglas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing my Bachelors in Spanish and Commercial Entrepreneurship, I plan on earning my Masters in Health Administration and hopefully opening up my own health insurance company. Therefore, when I noticed the many ads for different insurance companies in the Egyptian Gazette newspaper, it sparked a topic for me to put my concentration toward, learn more about, and do my analysis project on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-insurance-vs-what-is-assurance&#34;&gt;WHAT IS INSURANCE vs WHAT IS ASSURANCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”Insurance is an agreement in which and individual pays a company to protect him/her from possible loss or damage, can be a property loss or financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.” The belief has been formed that during the time the Egyptian Gazette was first being issued that the idea of insurance was first being created. One of the primary things I noticed while I was using the ‘Find/ Replace’ tool in oxygen to skim through the newspaper for insurance ads, were that there were a lot of different ads for not only insurance firms, but assurance firms as well. Following the research I did, my understanding concludes that assurance is basically just another form of insurance. The rates, policies and procedures are different, but they both fill a similar need. Insurance alludes to a coverage over a limited period of time, whilst assurance pertains to continuing coverage for extended periods of time or in some cases until death. As a matter of fact, I noticed that in the newspaper many insurance ad squares advertise both forms by placing two firms of diverse specialties in one square. For example, the Royal Insurance Company is quite often gathered with the Phoenix Assurance Company in their ad square. Therefore, I presumed that both organizations either cooperate with one another or they are associated with each other in some way to almost always consume the same space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;insurance-firms-and-their-specialties&#34;&gt;INSURANCE FIRMS AND THEIR SPECIALTIES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of my research was completed by utilizing the XPath search functions’ like  ‘Find/ Replace’ tool in oxygen and reading information from different online sources. In this analysis report I will discuss what my results were, some of the different steps in my research process and analysis, and a few different ways to proceed with this study given what information I have now.
I began my analysis by utilizing the XPath steps to find the words ‘insurance’ and ‘assurance’, so I could come across each different insurance and assurance firm mentioned throughout the newspaper issues that I have completed. Here are a portion of the core searches that produced the most results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][@n=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]//head[contains(.,&amp;quot;Insurance&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][@n=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]//head[contains(.,&amp;quot;Assurance&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][@n=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;]//p[contains(.,&amp;quot;surance&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this approach, I basically skimmed through every paragraph &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for “insurance” and “assurance”. Most of the results came from either the first two pages of any issue or the last two pages, in the form of advertisements.
Looking anyplace else brought integrated results like; mentions of insurance within headers were rare outside pages 1-2; however, looking inside different sections brought a bit of triumph. Each result came in the form of articles. While a few firms were referenced in the articles, I chose to limit my concentration to the advertisements, as the articles’ information regarding firms was not adequate for the sort of analysis I wanted to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the list of the insurance and assurance firms, their specialties, and their founding years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-visualizations&#34;&gt;DATA VISUALIZATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance firms in the Gazette were rated highly in the Insurance Almanac. Therefore, I tried to see whether there was a relationship between an insurance firm’s success and its pervasiveness in the newspaper (all thirteen firms were in the almanac). A number of firms mention their funds in their ads, though, so that would be my second parameter, and a more objective one at that.
Here are the numbers of times a company&amp;rsquo;s ad showed up in the Gazette, utilizing XPath to check the quantity of valid objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not impressed with my outcomes. Choosing to center my research and data through the advertisements not giving myself enough time to fully develop my findings, may have been the reason for my poor outcome. I believe that a more profound analysis of this topic requires great comprehension of history and finance (a skill I do not have). However, I did notice that there are some other directions that this study can take with regards to insurance in the Gazette that may lead to more substantial analysis projects, like using “The Reuter’s Telegrams and Share List tables.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maximum Heat of the Sun in Different Stations Across Alexandria [May 1906-April 1907]</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of this individual analysis project is to analyze a
range of maximum temperatures from data taken from different stations
in Alexandria, Egypt. I chose to investigate the timeline of May 1906
to April 1907 with the hopes of finding whether or not there are
correlations between the temperature of each location themselves. In
combination to this, I also will make inferences between why some
stations are higher than others and how that can relate to how busy
they are. With this in mind, I can further make inferences about foot
traffic and how that affects pollution levels in more popular or less
popular places, inherently affecting temperature data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of general questions that motivated me to focus
on this topic. The general topic of my group analysis project had to
do with looking at temperature change over the decades over the
country of Egypt, so I knew I had to do something within those
parameters. One guiding question I came up with is as follows:
“Do the measures in the heat of the sun section from the ‘Daily
Weather Report’ part of each issue of the newspaper flow accordingly
throughout the months recorded and will this data bring about any
sort of significance on other topics prevalent during this time in
Alexandria?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a genuine interest in climate change as a global topic in the
present, so seeing how it influenced and was reported in the past was
something I was excited to learn more about. After I drafted this
first question, I began to make inferences about what I thought would
answer the question. Recalling the historical time period of the
European and American Industrial Revolution, I drafted this next
sub-question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do higher temperatures recorded in various stations around
Alexandria change with the increase in industrialization measures?
With the past two general questions in mind, I decided to combine
them and some other smaller thoughts into the one big question that
serves as a general guideline of the project. It is stated below:
“With the investigation of the maximum temperature data taken from
various issues of the Egyptian Gazette from May 1907-April 1908, what
changes are clearly visible from location to location and how can
these implications be discussed in a social climate?”
Furthermore, let us continue the investigation by taking an interest
in the XPath Query I used to find the basic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xpath-query&#34;&gt;XPath Query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the XPath Query goes, I wanted to make sure I chose a
search that would funnel out all of the data I did not need, leaving
me with relevant and applicable numbers. Using the entirety of the
content folder from Github as the identification of sources I was
searching from, I used the following query to find the maximum
temperatures as recorded in different stations in Alexandria covered
in issues of the Egyptian Gazette : //table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;Max.
Temp &amp;lsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/text(). This search will give me
the results I need and exclude any irrelevant data, like minimum
temperatures for example. Each issue of the Egyptian Gazette has a
“Daily Weather Report” including a multitude of sources of
information. Some of these sources include the “Maximum Temperatures”
table, the “Minimum Temperatures” table, and more. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve
restricted it to the daily weather report, I needed to restrict it
further to just the heat of the sun which I did here. The last part
of the query including the “text()” is something I included to leave
the option open for me to further consolidate my research. Just for
interest, I filled in vocabulary such as “population” and “climate”
to learn more about the subject in context. But, the main usage for
this part of the query is where I ended up figuring out how to search
for the time period I was looking for. I got a little over 50 results
from this query, which I thought was a pretty good number to work off
of. Although my group and I originally decided to leave the data
unrestricted because we thought a lot of tables would have holes in
them, we decided to collectively and individually constrict the data
to about a year’s time so we could make quick predictions about
future weather reports across Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization&#34;&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gathering the data results from Oxygen, I then exported them
into an Atom file and used regular expressions to eliminate
unnecessary components. After this, I continued to export the edited
Atom data to a spreadsheet which was then opened in Tableau. After
playing around with the design of the graph and choosing the axes, I
decided to make a side bar graph to display the results I felt would
be most welcoming to the individual interpreting it. The visual is
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Initial Bar Graph of Heat
of the Sun Averages for each month.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to create a couple of graphs displaying the
average temperatures in each location as recorded in the Egyptian
Gazette , but while deciphering the data from Oxygen, I changed my
mind. I found there were a lot of gaps in the data over the time
period I chose, which was concerning. I figured it would not be a
very accurate form of data if one station has way more numbers to
factor in than another, which is the main reason I decided to just
keep it simple and use a wholly average graph. A lot of the
components of the graph had dashes instead of actual data points,
which led me to believe maybe the data was inefficiently taken or
there was an issue during publication of the section. If we look at
the visual presented above, maximum temperatures spark during both
April and July. There is a severe decrease in overall maximum
temperatures in January and more obviously February. This was one of
my initial predictions for the data visualization as I figured the
temperature rates would be consistent with the season they were filed
into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an overall sense, the data flows pretty well in the graph above. I
do think it would have been helpful to include the graphs displaying
averages per station from May 1907-April 1908, but I also think it is
important to keep the data as accurate as possible. The whole idea of
this project is generally looking at the effects of high temperatures
in different places and how that impacted parts of society back then.
A general graph supports a general idea, so I believe that “Figure 1”
graph gives a good idea and supports the overarching idea of the
study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;significance-of-the-data&#34;&gt;Significance of the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this subtopic particularly interesting because I take an
interest in climate change presently, so I think it’s cool to look at
the range between low and high temperatures in Alexandria during the
time period specified. Focusing more on maximum temperatures taken at
different stations in Alexandria lead to explanations dealing with
problems affected by high temperatures. These can range from health
problems, like maybe an increase in sickness with warmer weather or
in response to pollution. A link to a published book that I found on
Google Scholar, Observed Changes in Minimum and Maximum Temperature in
Nile Delta, Egypt in the 20th Century, by Ebtisam Mohamed and Maged
Hussein discuss the increase in temperature in the popular river
throughout the 1900s. Both authors take a range of temperature
samples from the Port Said location and the Cairo weather station
while simultaneously running multiple statistical tests to find
correlations. This article includes data on an annual scale, which is
cool to look at because it corresponds with the data found in the
Egyptian Gazette .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://platform.almanhal.com/Reader/Article/85154&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link to book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-context&#34;&gt;Historical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to other nations adopting the industrial standard in the
late nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century,
Alexandria was no exception. An article published by Professor Bent,
an instructor at the University of Oxford, discusses agrarian change
throughout Egypt from 1800-1950. Although this is a super broad time
period, it does include the annual range included in my data and
observations. Bent concluded that the industrial revolution in Egypt
earned its start towards the 1860s-1890s, and proceeded with more
efficiently produced technology up until about the 1930s (Bent 4).
From then on, scientists and business analysts alike researched
efficient and inefficient trends in consumer behavior and the
environmental impacts. I thought this study was pretty interesting to
read because it advocates the interconnectedness of people and
businesses, and how everything impacts the environment as a whole. In
the topic of maximum temperatures, more severe changes to the
environment seem to take measures according to Brent. A higher
population means more pollution concentrated in an area, which will
raise the overall temperature as plotted by the temperature charts.
This can lead to further investigation into how the climate will
change in certain areas dependent upon how many people inhabit that
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-remarks&#34;&gt;Research Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the process that served as the basis for this
investigation, I have learned a lot about the accuracy of data
collected from the Egyptain Gazette , basic ways to interpret
microfilm, and its overall importance and further implications. I
feel all of these subjects are vital to understand. As far as
accuracy goes, the initial holes that I found in my data when
researching specific stations and dates for their data showed me that
there were times errors occurred and the result was a lack in
numbers. Every time this happened in an issue which I found in Atom,
it decreased the general value of that specific issue and its weather
section specifically. Studying past weather trends, especially in
ever changing climates like Egypt, is important in giving us
information to base predictions for climate change in the future.
Further applicable case studies can be used in similar experimental
designs to show correlations in more detailed settings, but in order
to study the most trustworthy data, you need trustworthy numbers.
This is not always available in the case of the Egyptian Gazette.
Moving on to the actual scanning of the microfilm itself, I learned a
lot about what individuals were interested back then as I performed
markups on the XML documents. The advertisements paid for by the
supplier taught me a lot about graphic design back in the day and
market/advertising design. Using primary sources like issues from the
Egyptian Gazette is extremely helpful in deciphering data from older
sources. This newspaper was produced more than a century ago and is
preserved, thanks to technology, until more than the next century. If
computers, software, and scanning machines were not around today,
then it would take a lot more work in researching and displaying the
data collected for this topic. Although there are some issues with
how trustworthy the data collected is, the technology used to
interpret the data is very helpful in displaying it and sharing it
for others to learn from or be motivated by.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Medical Terminology as a means of analysis for the progression of medicine in Egypt and the British Empire</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-theophilopoulos/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-theophilopoulos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1905, the world found itself in quite the predicament regarding medicine due to the relatively unknown cause and actual pathophysiological processes surrounding infection and contamination of a pathogen. Egypt and Alexandria in particular were still under British rule, as can be seen through the Egyptian Gazette, which is a primarily English containing newspaper marketed towards the British in the surrounding Egyptian areas as well as those who dealt with these individuals on a primary basis. In conclusion, this newspaper was made for the rich imperialists in control. Because of this, many different European and British influences can be seen within the Egyptian Gazette, one of which being certain medically affiliated advertisements. Two advertisements which caught my eye in particular were ones advertising Dr. William’s Pink Pills as well as Doan’s Kidney Pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/klxKSl2.png&#34; alt=&#34;A Painful Portrait 1905-01-04&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pills were marketed as miracle pills that would be able to cure essentially any ailment that one encountered, including but not limited to kidney disease, heart palpitations, anxiety, stress, weakness, pain, backache, anaemia, clinical depression, poor appetite, and even cancer at one point. The funny part about the absurdness of the entire sales pitch?- they consisted of only iron oxide and magnesium sulfate. When looking into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5337769/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Reyhaneh Kheiri, et al., they found that iron oxide had no real positive effect on the body, and iron levels only slightly increased depending on the dose between 1-6 hours following consumption. 12 hours following consumption, no iron level change could be observed. Magnesium sulfate, on the other hand, does have some health benefits such as prevent low magnesium blood levels as well as seizures in women. It is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; unexpected that this compound also fails to treat any of the illnesses and conditions that these miracle pills claim to cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the catch? The simple answer is that these pills are entirely based on placebo and were such a large success due to the overall failure to understand medicine and pathology as we do today in modern medicine as well as the clever marketing that has been implemented not only in Egypt, but also worldwide during the selling of these pills. My analysis project deals primarily with the medical terminology which was employed in order to successfully market these “miracle pills”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin my analysis, I first had to find suitable advertisements that I would be able to use for this nature of a project. My main issue that I encountered was that most of the time, advertisements remain the same or only change once or twice throughout their lifetime in the Egyptian Gazette. This severely limited the advertisements that I would be able to use for this project, as I had to find more dynamic ones which were constantly changing on a daily or even monthly basis depending on the prevalence and frequency of them in the newspaper. I finally cut down all of the candidates I was originally looking at down to two: Dr. William’s Pink Pills &amp;amp; Doan’s Kidney Pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These advertisements seemed to be very different from other advertisements within the Egyptian Gazette in a couple different senses which made them perfect candidates for this embarkment. The main reason was because these advertisements often did not find themselves coming up within the main advertisement sections at all. The places that I found these advertisements were within actual bodies of text where stories and other items would be found. This meant that instead of being a reoccurring identical template, it changed constantly. In addition, because of this constant dynamic aspect that the advertisements had, they were often formatted in the form of a testimonial to make it seem less like a product being sold and more like an actual account from a civilian just like one who may be reading the newspaper, increasing their overall authenticity to the reader. In the end, this entire con is just a marketing scheme to make money, and it appears that these antics worked for a reason I will expand on when showing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedural-method-for-obtaining-results&#34;&gt;Procedural Method for Obtaining Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, due to the nature of these advertisements not actually being put into a advertisement div, I had to form my Xpath Query slightly differently so that it would find the instances of the title of the pills. I also was required to keep the Xpath Query fairly basic as narrowing it down in various ways resulted in not flagging positives as it should have been. For example, there was no template for these advertisements due to the fact that, once again, they were constantly changing throughout the Egyptian Gazette. The two queries that I used to create a database were the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//div/div/p[contains(., &amp;lsquo;Pink Pills’)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//div/div/p[contains(., ‘Doan’s Kidney Pills’)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving all of the div’s into a plaintext file, I separated them by year and began looking for patterns and certain terminology that I deemed important and observed repeating throughout. I then took specific words that I found important and created a database of the occurrences that they came up in the advertisements. I also counted the number of each advertisement for each year and then created a ratio of instances of word : instances of the advertisement that year. That created a fraction of the average number of times a specific word came up in one advertisement, allowing me to properly compare between years. I then plotted this data using Tableau and came up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dr-williams-pink-pills&#34;&gt;Dr. William&amp;rsquo;s Pink Pills:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_15758293045230/Sheet1?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doans-kidney-pills&#34;&gt;Doan&amp;rsquo;s Kidney Pills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1s_15758318890720/Sheet1?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-analysis&#34;&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this data, I was able to learn and infer a couple of different things. The first thing that stood out to me was the amount of times the advertisements for these “miracle pills” would come up throughout the Egyptian Gazette. For example, when looking at instances of Dr. William’s Pink Pills, in 1905 there were only 16 occurrences of the advertisement. In 1906, that number increased slightly to 19 instances. Then, in 1907, the number skyrocketed to 45 different instances of that advertisement throughout the year in the Egyptian Gazette. When looking Doan’s Kidney Pills, a similar jump can be observed in the Egyptian Gazette. In 1905, 11 instances were recorded, in 1906 12 instances were recorded, and in 1907 the number shot through the roof. This clearly goes to show that the success surrounding these pills was flourishing as much more money was able to be put towards advertising following what I believe was a good year or two of selling their product. I also believe that this is due to this relatively new method of advertising which implemented personal testimonials to sell the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other patterns that I observed from this data was regarding exactly why many of these terms decreased in frequency over the three year time span. I believe after looking at the data and taking a detailed look into what types of treatments that the pills were offering that as medicine became slightly more advanced over this time period, these advertisements began to vouch for treating less and less serious ailments. They instead appear to move towards more general symptoms, the primary one being pain. These advertisements saw an increase in the prevalence of “pain” as pain can be associated with various illnesses, allowing them to generalize to more diseases without distinctly claiming to cure one or the other. As actual treatments for certain illnesses became available, these “miracle pills” began to advertise less towards specific ones and more for general symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this move towards a better understanding of modern medicine can be seen in the word “blood”. I observed a decrease in the word blood within both advertisements, primarily because medicine was becoming more advanced as actual understanding of the body and pathogens slightly deepened. It was a common misconception that many ailments were caused by an impurity in the blood, and that a way to get new blood was a way to prevent further illnesses. These pills claimed to give “new blood” to the user, although this logic is clearly flawed by today’s understanding. As the understanding of pathology increased during this time period, we can also see a decrease in the word “blood” coming up in the newspaper, leading me to believe that this assumption of blood impurities became less prevalent as other more accurate explanations for illnesses arose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many diseases that emerged in the 19th century included cholera, yellow fever, typhus, smallpox, and many more. However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that weak medical practices became outdated. Before these breakthroughs there was only a basic understanding, which furthermore, commercialized the industry by selling medications with little to know regulation utilizing public fear and desperation. Many campaigns and ads sold the idea of “bad blood” being the cause as these medications were claimed to generate new blood and purify the body. Obviously, we know this is not real science but then, it was all the people knew and believed in regards to infectious diseases that were on a constant rise in the 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;?As for the application of these results to the group project, it ties in strongly with the other topics in the sense that we are able to apply these results to the work of the other topics within this project. For example, by looking at prevalence of words in advertisements, we can infer that certain ailments that are commonly found within the miracle pill advertisements likely also are symptoms of larger diseases that medical schools and hospitals are dealing with. We are able to get a sense for what is affecting the larger population and tie this in by looking at the proper ways that these illnesses and symptoms are being treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;medical-schools-and-the-diseases-found&#34;&gt;Medical Schools and the Diseases Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation between the location of medical schools and hospitals with the diseases that were being researched at these medical facilities. By finding if these diseases were prevalent in certain areas, it may be concluded that  the disease was being researched at a prominent medical institution.  The first disease found was Tropical Disease which is mentioned in the Gazette four times. Three of these times were cases within Cairo and the last one was found within Sudan. While this data is not enough to say there was an epidemic, it may be enough to deduce that these areas were experiencing hardships from this disease. The lack of knowledge about this disease stemmed from fear of the collapsing British Empire. One gave a fearful message that the Tropical Disease would lead to the death of the British Empire if it was not completely eradicated. The article then called for the Kasr-el-Ainy and other medical schools to try and find a cure to this disease.  There was only one occurrence of the disease within Sudan at the Gordon College Laboratories,but that is only to talk about trying to find a cure for the animals in that area.   It can be seen by the number of times this disease was mentioned to be in Cairo that this disease was mainly affecting that area during the period of 1905-1906. Also, with the article blatantly warning the public of London about how the disease would cause extreme harm to the British Empire from those who were in Cairo, it can be shown that the disease was mainly affecting this region in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another disease that appeared in the newspaper was trypanosomiasis. This disease was mainly found within Sudan, but upon further inspection it was shown that this disease only stemmed from another disease called sleeping sickness. We used the x-path queries below to research more about sleeping sickness in Sudan and at Gordon College. Sleeping sickness was the main disease that was prevalent since there are 17 occurrences of the term within the newspaper. This disease was being researched by the Gordon College Laboratories in Sudan, but there were articles explaining how the disease was killing off livestock and people within the area of Sudan.Upon further inspection, we wanted to see if there would be a link between the Kasr-el-Ainy and Cairo.  Both of queries yielded no results for either which could mean that the disease was only centralized to Sudan or that a cure was found before it was able to spread to elsewhere. I was able to find one outside resource &lt;a href=&#34;search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;amp;db=edsbl&amp;amp;AN=vdc.100063233501.0x000001&amp;amp;site=eds-live&amp;amp;scope=site.&#34;&gt;Elimination of Sleeping Sickness&lt;/a&gt;that talked about how political and social conflict within Sudan could lead to a cure for sleeping sickness to be halted. It was a very interesting to see how these disease is still affecting those in Sudan for over 100 years. Also, this article gave me an insight into how modern medicine is now begin used to treat early disease from the 1900s that have caused much harm an area.  The graphs for the analysis of sleeping sickness in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;diseases&#34;&gt;Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disease that appeared in the newspaper was the Bubonic Plague or also known as the Third Pandemic. The earliest records of the Bubonic Plague within &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was found on January second of 1905. However, according to history, the first outbreaks of the plague in Egypt took place back in April of 1899 after a long time of disease-free (&lt;a href=&#34;www.jstor.org/stable/20436191.&#34;&gt;Plague In Egypt&lt;/a&gt;). The plague has persisted in Egypt each year since 1899 arriving from the trade ports. With that said, that means that the cities closest to the ports must be the ones most affected by it. After gathering the following data through the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and inputting it into Tableau, this statement proved to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Bubonicplaguechartdata/Sheet2?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the city that was most frequently affected by the Bubonic Plague was Alexandria. Following Alexandria was Suez, which also has a huge trade port that connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea. However, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; newspaper explained another possibility of why this might be the case. &amp;ldquo;It is the only town with a drainage system, and many of the drains are in a very dilapidated condition and infested with rats. This may be one of the reasons which account for the persistence of the disease at Alexandria&amp;rdquo; (1906-07-27.xml).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a considerable diminution in the number of cases of plague in Egypt as in the year of 1905. However, the following year, in 1906, the plague spread and the number of cases severely increased. In comparison with 1904, there was a considerable diminution in the number of cases of plague in Egypt as in the year of 1905. However, the following year, 1906, the plague spread and the number of cases severely increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to preventing the spread of this plague, “Clayton Gas” was used in the early 1900s. It destroyed not only rats and vermin, but also the parasites on them and sterilized the eggs of insects as well. Since no cures were discovered until 20 years later, preventions taken towards infected humans were unsuccessful. An important thing to notice is that the infected rat is the cause of the disease remaining endemic in a town, but the epidemic form of the disease is caused by the infected human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph shows how mentions of ad have no correlation to mentions of cholera throughout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/cholera_15753985669840/Sheet1?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one advertisement claims to remedy cholera, diarrhea, colic, and dysentery, and that product is Dr. J. Collis Browne’s Chlorodyne.  Surprisingly enough, the product is only advertised fourteen times over the three years or so of the newspaper that has been encoded.  Further research into Chlorodyne revealed that the medication was an effective treatment for these diseases as well as other ailments not listed in the advertisements.  The reasoning behind its effectiveness were the active ingredients being opiates and marijuana (McCabe, 1979) .  Interestingly enough this advertisement that claims to remedy cholera do not seem to have any correlation to when cholera was mentioned more frequently in the newspaper, even as fears of cholera began to spread within Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an editorial by Charles McCabe written in 1979, he recalls the days when Dr. J. Collis Browne’s Chlorodyne was available everywhere.  McCabe described the potion as  “a staple of British medicine cabinets since 1848.”  He further states that chlorodyne took “care of the most persistent of the traveler’s and imperialist complaints, dysentery of one kind or another.  It [was] also good for hangovers.  It subdues the screaming angst.  It is one of the best sleeping potions I know.”  He further states that the modern version of chlorodyne, which they now call “J. Collis Browne’s Mixture” is not as effective as the older version.  The original concoction was able to “combat ‘colds, coughs, influenza, diarrhea, stomach chills, cholic…” etc. the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, this advertisement was not run many times over the course of our repository.  And this is strange being that Charles McCabes testimony, although from 1979, was very convincing of how well this product works in treating an assortment of ailments.  Maybe the advertising budget in Alexandria, Egypt at the time was not much, and that&amp;rsquo;s why the ad was not widely published.  According to McCabe, this medicine was widely published throughout British newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of an ongoing disease plaguing both Egypt and Europe during this time period was tuberculosis. At the beginning of the 19th century treatments consisted of the encouragement of adopting a new lifestyle. Hiking, eating fruits and vegetables, and fresh air were very common examples of this change in “bad living”. As this became outdated, the development of sanatoriums became more acceptable. Due to the lack of technology and understanding of immunology, antibiotics and vaccinations had not yet been invented, therefore, bed rest in a sanatorium was really the only option for the individuals infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Tuberculosisstats/Story1?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bar graph displays the frequency of tuberculosis mentioned within the Egyptian Gazette, primarily in the local and general section. Ads such as Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People and Puruna feature other disorders and medical conflicts. These include paralysis, rheumatism, and ladies’ complaints. Oddly, however, is the neglect to mention tuberculosis, the infamous “white plague”. Clearly this is a little puzzling seeing how tuberculosis was in many local and general headlines as a deadly concern of the population. This confirms the idea that medical advances were very limited at this time in Egypt and Europe as they were never featured in pill ads that claimed to be the cure-all, miraculously relieving a patient in a matter of days. Many methods and trials probably failed or were not worth mentioning in the Gazette since readers might have been more interested in hearing about success stories rather than failed attempts at one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease and sickness was a hot topic during this time of uncertainty and doubt, paving the way for big time advertisers to market their ideas and sell an abundance of pill bottles of color- coated candy that claimed to cure everything when in reality, they couldn’t cure a headache. But much of what was not understood during this time can be directly related to what lead to the later understanding of medicine and immunology that we possess today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Brings in the Crowds for Sporting Events?</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-sports/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-sports/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, sports have impacted the lives of not only the participants, but also the fans who choose to watch them. As the sports group, we decided to focus our analysis project on the different factors which can affect spectator turnout across the major sports of the Egyptian Gazette. Among residents of early 1900’s Egypt, three of the most popular sports were football (soccer), polo, and horse racing. By looking into the data that we have collected for these sports, we are able to get an idea of what Egyptian sport fans wanted to see. Through our analysis of the Egyptian Gazette data and cross-checking with multiple studies on attendance of various sports, we have concluded that in early 1900’s Egypt, there were three major factors of sports attendance: level of competition/skill of either side, rivalry between the two sides, and importance/stakes of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how to get fans in attendance of sporting events is nothing new; as long as there have been sports, there have been those in charge trying to increase attendance. Especially recently, sporting events provide a large stream of revenue, so factors which influence attendance are important information for those involved in sports. Experts and researchers, such as John Douvis and Peter Bird, have tried finding these factors in many different ways across a wide range of sports. These publications are looking at current factors, of which many do not apply to early 1900’s Egypt, however common themes across generations have held true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to collect this data, we ran a series of XPath queries aimed at finding as many games as possible for each sport. We searched for the “sport and play” sections of the newspaper, where sports data and stats are most often found. One problem we came across was that many of the sport and play sections were not tagged with the sport feature type. To combat this, we removed //div[@feature=”sport”] from our queries and replaced it with //head[matches(.,’sport and play’, ‘i’)]. What this did was return to us any div with the header “Sport and Play,” which only included sport and play sections. We utilized this along with searching for sport-specific terms like “chukker” (polo) to collect the full data range that was available to us. We also realized that many sections use qualitative descriptions instead of numbers for attendance data. These sections often used the same terms, such as “fine,” “large,” and “very large,” so we recorded these descriptions anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;football&#34;&gt;Football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Football was one of the most popular sports at the time, often played between different military regiments or schools. The military teams, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, were split into teams or “companies,” although they did sometimes compete together. This brings us to our first factor of attendance, level of competition.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Attendance of each football game
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

When looking at the attendance data for these games, the effect of this factor becomes clear. The matches with high attendance are all between two of the military unit teams at full strength, and not divided into companies. Matches between two of the subdivided units, such as the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers F. and D. Companies, tended to have much less attendance than the more high-profile competitions. This, of course, is logical because more fans are going to be willing to attend a game if it is between two good teams. The research of Peter J. W. N. Bird on league football attendance also supports this factor. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www-jstor-org.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/stable/2348449?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“The Demand for League Football,”&lt;/a&gt; Bird looks at various teams and determined that whether or not the team was a contender during the season or a contender for the play-offs was a highly significant factor with a strong positive relation to attendance. Continuing with this first factor, the skill level of the away team appears to also play a role.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Football attendance vs margin of victory
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

The data above shows that there was significantly higher attendance in games where the away team had a bigger the margin of victory (shown by the points below 0). This correlation is strikingly direct, and displays an positive relationship between attendance and away team performance. This suggests a number of things, but we concluded the reason for this trend is that when a good team is in town, fans in the area would be likely to attend the game. Often, teams would have large gaps between games at the same away location, so fans understood that each of these games was the last time they could see the team for a while.  This is supported by Hal Hansen and Roger Gauthier, who in 1989 researched and collected &lt;a href=&#34;http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;amp;P=AN&amp;amp;K=16462549&amp;amp;S=R&amp;amp;D=s3h&amp;amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40Sep644wtvhOLCmr1Gep7dSsKa4TbSWxWXS&amp;amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGrsUi2pq5MuePfgeyx43zx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;40 different factors&lt;/a&gt; which impact attendance. Included in these are the record of the visiting team and the number of star athletes on the visiting team. Like it does for the home team, the skill level of the away team makes people more inclined to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polo&#34;&gt;Polo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest team sports in history, polo was also very popular in early 1900’s Egypt. Like football, polo was often played by military regiments, but polo also included more organized teams. Because there was more parity between teams, attendance is more uniform across games than football.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Attendance of polo games
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Polo attendance in the Egyptian Gazette was only recorded as “fair,” “large,” or “very large,” so we decided to display these terms numerically 1-3 for our data visualization. Our second attendance factor, rivalry or repeated matchups, applies to our polo data. Teams like the 60th Rifles, the Mosquitos, the Egyptian Army, and the Tourists played each other more often than other teams did, and thus drew significantly bigger audiences for their games. This factor is corroborated by Hansen and Gauthier, who have “Rivalry between competing home team and opponent” as a significant factor. G.V. Wall, a researcher who analyzed attendance of Toronto Blue Jays’ games, also determined that rivalry is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://sparti.uop.gr/~toda/asmrj/Vol1_c.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“especially prominent indicator of attendance.”&lt;/a&gt; As teams play each other more, the competitiveness of the matchup rises, and fans are more interested in the result. Along with this, these teams played more games in general, meaning fans were more familiar with them and more likely to attend a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horse-racing&#34;&gt;Horse Racing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sport of the Egyptian Gazette that we are analyzing is horse racing. The data we found for horse racing was unique to that of our other sports because of the different stats and measurements that are recorded for it. First of all, these races all had different stakes and payouts for 1st-3rd place. Helouan was very popular venue for these horse races, but most of these races tended to be lower stakes, more recreational competitions. Instead, we are focusing on the derbies or “plates” with higher stakes. Along with the increased competition, spectators were drawn to these races because of the money on the line. Some of these plates had first place prizes upwards of 25,000 Egyptian pounds, which naturally generated more interest from fans.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Stakes for each race&amp;rsquo;s top 3 finishers
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

We call this factor the importance factor, because spectators are generally more interested in competitions that are more important and have more on the line, whether it be prize money or a championship trophy. This factor is why, for example, NBA Finals games are more watched than regular season competitions. The importance factor stems from a combination of multiple other factors, as many things go into how “important” a competition is. In the case of horse racing in the Egyptian Gazette, this importance comes from the large sums of money available to the winners. Unsurprisingly, the plates highest in prize amounts are the plates which were most popular and anticipated. The Sahara Stakes is especially significant, boasting a 33,000 first place prize, and a second-place prize double that of any other race we found. These plates are among the most popular of any sporting event in the Egyptian Gazette because of their high stakes and intensity. The importance factor is also seen in the sport of billiards. Despite its popularity, the data found for billiards in the newspaper is rather sparse. However, we can see that the attendance in the match referred to as the “final match” was described as “smoking” and “a concert,” as opposed to others which just state that attendance was “few.” Overall, the factor of importance describes how much the average fan cares about the result of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across any sport, there are common factors which influence spectator turnout. The level of competition, or the skills of either team, is our first attendance factor. Fans would rather watch competition between two good teams than two poor ones, so games with better participants competing will draw more of a crowd. Specifically, in the case of football, the skill of the away team also impacts attendance, as more fans will go to a game if the visiting team is especially good. Rivalries are also a significant factor in attendance, because as two teams continue to play each other, the intensity and emotions of the matchup increase with each game. Finally, fans have more interest in important games with higher stakes and more on the line. When the competition has a large prize, like in horse racing, or is a championship, like in billiards, people have more interest in the outcome of the game and are more likely to choose to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bubonic Plague</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-naranjo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-naranjo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of my post is to answer questions such as the reasons behind the spread of the Bubonic Plague across Egypt, what cities were the most affected and why, and what actions were taken to cease it. In doing so I will integrate charts and graphs of where and when occurrences were the most often. This information was gathered conducting an Xpath query on the Egyptian Gazette between the years 1904-1907. The following query will be used to search for words such as &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bubonic&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bubonic plague&amp;rdquo;. The following Xpath query was included
//div[@type=&amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo;][@n=&amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; or @n=&amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; or @n=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo;]/div[not(@type=&amp;ldquo;advert&amp;rdquo;) or (@type=&amp;ldquo;advertisement&amp;rdquo;)]/p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Bubonicplaguechartdata/Sheet2?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of my post is to answer questions such as the reasons behind the spread of the Bubonic Plague across Egypt, what cities were the most affected and why, and what actions were taken to cease it. The answers to these questions will be collected from in-depth research within the pages of the Egyptian Gazette from the years 1905 and 1907. In doing so I will integrate charts and graphs of where and when occurrences were the most often. To conduct this research, formulating an Xpath query was necessary to produce results. Words such as &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bubonic&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bubonic plague&amp;rdquo; were put in &lt;em&gt;find/replace in files&lt;/em&gt; in Oxygen Editor restricting it to the following Xpath: &lt;strong&gt;//div[@type=&amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo;][@n=&amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; or @n=&amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; or @n=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; or @n=&amp;ldquo;6&amp;rdquo;]/div[not(@type=&amp;ldquo;advert&amp;rdquo;) or (@type=&amp;ldquo;advertisement&amp;rdquo;)]/p&lt;/strong&gt;. What this Xpath query does is that it looks under the first two &lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt; located only in pages 3, 4, or 5 of the newspaper for a certain word or phrase inside a paragraph that must not be an ad. Knowing that pages one and two are full with ads and so are the last two, the xpath query ignores those pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, doing just this will end in hundreds of thousands of useless results. Therefore, three different working sets were created which were configured to only include files from one year. In other words, the Xpath stated above was ran separately on each year. The outcome from this search then revealed useful information that was then applied to formulate graphs and maps shown below as well as theoretical responses to my questions regarding the Third Pandemic spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest records of the Bubonic Plague within &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was found on January second of 1905. However, according to history, the first outbreaks of the plague in Egypt took place back in April of 1899 after a long time of disease-free (&lt;a href=&#34;www.jstor.org/stable/20436191.&#34;&gt;Plague In Egypt&lt;/a&gt;). Here is a quick description from the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; itself of what the bubonic plague was, how it spread, and examples of incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It appears from the report that I have received from Dr. Cresswell and from my own observations, (says Sir H. Pinching in his report) that these cases are due to infection conveyed by rats, which had been infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt. One of the persons attacked by plague at Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta and tea from Madras. In moving the cases containing these goods the dead bodies of rats were found.&amp;rdquo; (1905-01-02.xml)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the exposure to the plague in other regions or nations, the economy and thus trade did not stop. The Egyptian government, did not want to interrupt trading among allies as it would cause severe economic problems (&lt;a href=&#34;www.jstor.org/stable/20436191.&#34;&gt;Plague In Egypt&lt;/a&gt;). After the terrifying news spread through the country, precautions were taken in ports of other countries, &amp;ldquo;A telegram from Constantinople of yesterday states that arrivals from Alexandria are submitted to a medical examination and disinfection, while rats on board ship must be destroyed&amp;rdquo;(1905-06-19). Based on my research throughout the newspaper, as you can see above, the way the Bubonic plague spread in Egypt was through the trade ports from Delta or Upper Egypt. Although rats are blamed here, it was actually through infected fleas humans got the plague as they sucked blood from the infected rats and then bit humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when was this vast plague the worst? In other words when and where was it the most frequent. To answer these questions, lots of exhaustive research was performed. As previously stated, the words &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bubonic&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bubonic plague&amp;rdquo; were used in my query. After analyzing the text, the newspaper contained a section with weekly reports of the amount of incidents across Egypt as well as in other parts of the world, stories, and  more. The following bar graph was constructed using my findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NOTE: Bar graph data not exact to real numbers, yet it is an accurate small-scale representation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Bubonicplaguechartdata/Bargraph?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with 1904, as the bar graph shows, there was a considerable diminution in the number of cases of plague in Egypt as in the year of 1905. However, the following year, 1906, the plague spread and the number of cases severely increased. Real estimates are said to be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The total number of cases notified since the beginning of the year amounted to 464 against 257 and 854 for the corresponding periods of 1905 and 1904 respectively.&amp;rdquo; (1906-09-25.xml)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plague has persisted in Egypt each year since 1899 arriving from the trade ports. With that said, that means that the cities closest to the ports must be the ones most affected by it. After gathering the following data through the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and inputting it into Tableau, this statement proved to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NOTE: Map data not exact to real numbers, yet it is an accurate small-scale representation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Bubonicplaguechartdata/Sheet2?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the city that was most frequently affected by the Bubonic Plague was Alexandria. Following Alexandria was Suez, which also has a huge trade port that connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea. However, after reading through the newspaper I encountered another possibility of why this might be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is the only town with a drainage system, and many of the drains are in a very dilapidated condition and infested with rats. This may be one of the reasons which account for the persistence of the disease at Alexandria&amp;rdquo; (1906-07-27.xml).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to preventing the spread of this plague, “Clayton Gas” was used in the early 1900s. It destroyed not only rats and vermin, but also the parasites on them and sterilized the eggs of insects as well. Since no cures were discovered until 20 years later, preventions taken towards infected humans were unsuccessful. An important thing to notice is that the infected rat is the cause of the disease remaining endemic in a town, but the epidemic form of the disease is caused by the infected human being.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diseases and the Medical Schools/Hospitals History</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-dorsey/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-dorsey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of my analysis project was to discover where medical schools were located within Egypt and what diseases where occurring near these schools. I then wanted to know if the occurrences of these disease in correlation with a certain school of medicine, would mean that the disease was an epidemic for that region. I wanted to know this because if the disease was found to be researched in these medical schools and hospitals  In the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; the term &lt;em&gt;medical school&lt;/em&gt; is not common but the term &lt;strong&gt;school of medicine&lt;/strong&gt; is. Using this term, I was able to find 53 items concerning this term. Many of these articles where talking about how there were meetings at these schools but there were no indicators about what disease may have been in the area. Upon further searching, I was able to find words such as &lt;strong&gt;Tropical Disease&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Trypanosomiasis&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Sleeping Sickness&lt;/strong&gt; which helped me to further my search in to the diseases effecting which areas.  Also, I began to search for &lt;strong&gt;Kasr-el-Ainy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gordon College&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Laboratories&lt;/strong&gt; in order to have a clearer view on where these diseases may have been treated at in addition to the medical schools. I planned to use an excel spreadsheet to record the data I find on each disease and what medical school or hospital is treated that disease. After looking at that, I will use visualizations such as a map and a bar graph to show how many times a certain disease was talked about in an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first term I looked for was &lt;em&gt;Tropical Disease&lt;/em&gt; because it was shown to be treated at both a school of medicine and the Kasr-el-Ainy which were in Cairo. I used this X-path query &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][matches(., &amp;quot;Cairo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;, to find the amount of occurrences where tropical disease and Cairo were mentioned together. I was only able to find three times where both terms were mentioned together.  In one article, the writer was explaining how one school of medicine was being built in order to investigate the cause of Tropical Disease within the area of Alexandra and Cairo. Another article gave a brief description of the Tropical Disease which was seen to be caused by germs. Though I found information about what the disease was, I was unable to find the effects of the disease on the people in &lt;em&gt;Alexandra and Cairo&lt;/em&gt;. The lack of description about Tropical Disease may stem from the fear that the disease may cause a decrease in the white male community. For example, one article called the &lt;em&gt;Our Letter to London, (May 18, 1905)&lt;/em&gt;; explained how the Tropical Disease would be the real enemy of the white man if the disease was to spread. The article talked about how in order to preserve the prosperity of the empire, Tropical Disease would need to be cured with “tropical medicine” that would need to be researched by the medical school and laboratories. Another article titled, &lt;em&gt;Proposed Tropical School of Medicine (May 22, 1906)&lt;/em&gt;; Tropical Disease is starting to be investigated by the Kasr-el-Ainy Hospital in order to find ways for the disease to be cured Cairo and Alexandra. This led me to my next search for the correlation between laboratories and tropical disease, in order to see what areas, the laboratories were in and if the were studying tropical disease. I was only able to find one instance in the newspaper where Tropical Disease was begin researched by a laboratory. I used these X-path queries &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][matches(., &amp;quot;Sudan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][matches(., &amp;quot;Gordon College&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt; to find any occurrences where Tropical Disease was found in   Within the &lt;em&gt;Local and General Section of November 27, 1906&lt;/em&gt;, I was able to find a passage about the Gordon College Laboratories. &lt;em&gt;The Gordon College&lt;/em&gt; Laboratories was the only laboratory I found to researching the tropical disease, but the research on the disease was being conducted in Sudan and not Cairo or Alexandra. I found this to be very interesting best the disease traveled within the year but there was still no concrete information about the disease expect for the fact that it was affecting animals and humans. I was unable to find any advertisements for treatment of tropical disease, but I believe that this lack of advertisements stems from the fears of the British in Egypt of the disease causing a lack of tourism and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another disease called Trypanosomiasis was mentioned when I started to research Gordon College Laboratories. This disease was affecting Sudan and was seen to be a secondary disease stemming from sleeping sickness. I used this X-path query: //div[@type=&amp;ldquo;item&amp;rdquo;][matches(., &amp;ldquo;Sudan&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rdquo;)] and //div[@type=&amp;ldquo;item&amp;rdquo;][matches(., &amp;ldquo;Gordon College&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rdquo;)]  to find where sleeping sickness was presence in Sudan, I then used this same query with Trypanosomiasis. There are 17 different occurrences in the paper of sleeping sickness in Sudan. Yet, I only found 3 occurrences of Trypanosomiasis in Sudan within the paper. I was only able to find one occurrence where Gordon College is mentioned with sleeping sickness and Trypanosomiasis.  Both Trypanosomiasis and sleeping sickness were affecting the animals and people in the area of Sudan. One article named, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Sickness in Sudan, (January 5, 1905)&lt;/em&gt;, The Gordon College Laboratories appears here again for their efforts to find more about this disease. Trypanosomiasis is better detailed in the newspaper because in the article mentioned above the disease is seen to spread from Glossina palpalis. Then I began to do different X-path queries to see if I could find any pages/articles that contained Trypanosomiasis spread to Alexandra or Cairo. After doing searches, I was unable to find anything showing any cases where Trypanosomiasis was being researched in any medical schools or hospitals with Alexandra or Cairo. I did an X-path query where I looked for Trypanosomiasis begin investigated by the Kasr-el-Ainy, but I received no results. When researching sleeping sickness in the library, I was able to find one article that talked about a cure was found in Sudan for sleeping sickness. The article &lt;em&gt;(Elimination of sleeping sickness in Uganda could be jeopardised by conflict in South Sudan)&lt;/em&gt; was explaining how the political and social conflict within Sudan would cause a possible delay in the administration of the cure for sleeping sickness. It was very interesting to find this article because it shows how modern medicine has given way to helping cure a disease that has been plaguing the area of Sudan for over 100 years. In the late 1900s, the preventive measures taken against the disease where beginning to become better which has led to the both of there begin less than 5 cases per year.  The author recalled how during times of civil unrest, the cases of sleeping sickness began to rise again due to the lack of attention begin placed on this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mosquitoes in the Egyptian Gazette</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-grimaldo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-grimaldo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the analysis project, my group focused primarily on the environment in Egypt, and the various aspects of the environment. For my individual analysis, I’ve decided to focus on the mosquitoes in the environment in Egypt. I was curious as to how mosquitoes tied into the environment, more specifically if they were prevalent in the environment, what time of year mosquitoes seemed to come around and interfere with the daily lives of the individuals living in Egypt, and how they affected individuals and business in Egypt. After I found the various data, I created bar graphs to compare the data I found, and I strived to find connections and similarities in the different sets of data I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to discover the time of year that mosquitoes came around in Egypt. To do this, I decided to create an Xpath query to search for the number of paragraphs in which individuals in the Egyptian Gazette mentioned mosquitoes in the newspaper, by searching “count(//div[contains(., ‘mosquito’)]).” My thought process was that if people in the newspaper are mentioning “mosquitoes,” that must mean that mosquitoes are around, and more importantly affecting the people in Egypt. When I searched for these results, I found many instances of the word “mosquito,” and put it into Excel. My results were very consistent through the years 1905-1907, mostly finding prevalence in mosquitoes from December-March, with few inconsistencies. Although the word “mosquito” was found mostly in this time frame of months, the word “mosquito” was still mentioned throughout the year, just much less than from December-March. Because, for the most part, “mosquito” was mentioned at the same time each year, I can come to the conclusion that the number of times that word was mentioned directly correlates to the times of year that mosquitoes were around and affecting the population.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I wanted to study the various ways mosquitoes affected the individuals in Egypt. I conducted this research by searching online for this information. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.16.4.419&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, I found that work had been done in the history of Egypt to exterminate mosquitoes, beginning with studying the biology of them, and then figuring out different techniques to get rid of them completely. At first, people in Egypt drained oil in order to keep mosquitoes away from their environment, but there was a shift in how they got rid of them. Because Egypt is home to many deserts and dry areas, mosquitoes don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be very much around, except for the areas which have pools of water, where mosquitoes are most attracted. Through thorough research, I also found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=If1AAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA305&amp;amp;lpg=PA305&amp;amp;dq=mosquitoes&amp;#43;egypt&amp;#43;1905&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=Rizc18319z&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U09pYf7mNMniX-IEpniS1c8GzMnbw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8xKShh6XmAhVBn-AKHeuFCgoQ6AEwDHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=mosquitoes%20egypt%201905&amp;amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; that mosquitoes were reproducing heavily in 1904 and 1905, causing the Dengue disease, causing so many people to visit the hospital and this disease existed even throughout 1907, making it&amp;rsquo;s way through Cairo, but somehow avoiding Port Said and Ismailia. Mosquitoes were able to transmit this disease from man to man through sucking blood out of individuals. Clearly, mosquitoes were a large issue and affected many people in the town, as well as many businesses, like the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the hospitals, mosquito infestations made Calvert’s business boom. While coding the 1908 newspaper, I found that there were many Calvert’s advertisements that promoted various creams and ointments for sunburns, as well as mosquito irritability. I found these ads mostly in pages 1 and 2, however one advertisement was on page 5. I was curious as to what time of year these Calvert’s advertisements showed up in the Egyptian Gazette. My hypothesis was that they would show up at the same time of year as the word “mosquito” was mentioned the most in the newspaper. If mentioning “mosquito” many times in the newspaper meant that was when mosquitoes were affecting the population the most, the Calvert’s business would boom off advertising their products at the same time. So, I did a key word search for Calvert’s ads, and found, as I suspected, that the advertisements that promoted ointments for mosquito bites, showed up at the same times as the word “mosquito” was popular in the newspaper. I created bar graphs to clearly see the correlation between the word “mosquito” popping up in the newspaper, and the Calvert’s ad popping up in the newspaper.

      <title>The Cotton Worm in Egypt from 1905 to 1907</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-bryant/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-bryant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cotton has been an essential export from the Egyptian economy for centuries, sometimes being referred to as the country’s “white gold”. In the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a cotton worm epidemic that greatly threatened the cotton plants across all the Egyptian provinces. The Khedive made a national decree that informed the public of the cotton worm menace, and contained a call to action for citizens to band together to combat the cotton worm. One way that Egypt went about protecting their harvests from the cotton worms was to conscript local children to go out into the fields and pick the cotton worms and cotton worm larvae off the plant stems by hand. From the years 1905 to 1907, thousands of children were enlisted to help save the harvests in every cotton containing province. The amount of land that was affected by the cotton worms is measured in feddans, an arabic unit to measure land. One feddan is just under the size of one acre (1 feddan=1.03 acre). Within the Egyptian Gazette, there is a copy of the Khedivial Decree of the cotton worm menace, many articles containing information about the amount of feddans affected by the cotton worm and how much of the land was cleansed by a certain number of children, and other articles relevant to the cotton worm situation. By examining the amount of land affected, how much of that affected land was picked free of cotton worms and larvae, and how many children were working to get rid of the cotton worms, the general success of the movement against the cotton worm from 1905 to 1907 can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khedivial Decree, found in the 1905-03-01 edition of the Egyptian Gazette, informs that the plants infested with the cotton worm must be stripped and burned. It outlines that any able-bodied men from ages 9 to 17 must work in the fields to cleanse the cotton worm for a minimum salary that matched the market prices. Any child that refuses to work or commits any act of negligence while working could be fined and thrown in prison for up to a week. The Khedivial Decree was originally published in French and was translated to English via Google Translate. The Khedivial Decree shows the serious nature of the cotton worm menace, and how it posed a critical threat to all of Egypt. By taking such extensive measures like child conscription, it is evident that the Egyptian authority realized the potential danger of the cotton worm and the necessity to take drastic measures to avoid an even worse outcome.
Articles titled “The Cotton Worm” in the Egyptian Gazette pop up pretty often in the “Local and General” section of page 3 and detail the latest reports on the cotton worm infestation. Cotton Worm articles show how many feddans are affected, and how many were cleansed, and sometimes how many children were used to do the work. The data these articles provide is the main method in tracking the progress of the fight against the cotton worm. Most of the articles appeared in the months of July and August.
Following are graphs of the amount of land that was attacked by cotton worm, how much was cleansed, and how many children were used to pick the worms.
Note: for 1906 and 1907, there was no report of the number of children used in the combat of the cotton worm.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

There may be errors in the data due to cotton worm infestations that were not reported in the Egyptian Gazette, problems with OCR, the existence of articles that did not show up in any of the xpath queries, or various other forms of human error. Regardless, I believe that the graphs serve their purpose in giving a general understanding of when the cotton worm epidemic was most prevalent in Egypt from 1905 to 1907 and which provinces were most affected. It also gives an idea of the sheer number of local children that were conscripted to go out in the fields and pick the worms and larvae; in 1905 there were at least 250,000 children, although the real number is likely much higher. From 1905 to 1906, the amount of land affected by the worm seems to slowly decline, revealing a steady success from the worm picking and cotton burning conscripted force. 1907 shows a sharp decrease in the number of attacked and cleansed feddans, but I think this is extremely exaggerated from the truth because of data that has not yet been entered into the content repository.
Further contextual information and analysis can be found in the essay [Boom, Bugs, Bust: Egypt’s Ecology of Interest, 1882-1914] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anti.12216&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anti.12216&lt;/a&gt;) of A Radical Journal of Geography. In the essay, author Aaron Jakes tells of the cotton worm infestation that took root in 1904. He explains that it posed a devastating outcome to the Egyptian economy and, as a result, the Ministry of Interior drafted all boys from ages 9 to 17 to do gang work in picking the worm off of cotton stalks, stripping the plants of their leaves, then transport them to a site to be burned. He also addresses the fact that most of these boys came from poor farming families that depended on their children’s labor.
The cotton worm targeted the vast fields of cotton in the provinces near and along the Nile and its delta. In order to combat the epidemic infestation, Egypt issued a decree forcing young boys to go out in the fields and manually pick the cotton worms off the plants, strip the stalks, then transport and burn them. After the khedivial decree in 1905, cotton worm combat forces surged, and the amount of land affected to slowly and steadily declined as the epidemic seemed to be taken under control. Over the years, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of boys were drafted into the cotton worm destruction force.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Billiards Participants</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hayes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hayes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper will examine the various types of individuals who go to and participate in billiards events. The specific topics was sparked by a query into the sport. Initially, the query resulted with only ten results, which was quite a large comparison to the other individuals in my group who resulted in hundreds, if not thousands of results when querying soccer or horse racing. The low number of results encouraged me to really delve into the few amount of results to figure out the reason for such a low number. For this analysis I will focus on why these individuals are playing in these billiards competitions and where they are playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of a sporting event can be one of the most important tell tales of how much wealth the sport brings in. Before we can get into analyzing the results we must first learn about how and where the results are going to come from. For the entirety of this analysis essay I will be doing a search through the Egyptian Gazette spanning the years 1905-1907. This newspaper was produced in Egypt and now we are able to go back and take a glance into the world of Egypt and compare it to the world that we live in today. In order to do a thorough search through the Egyptian Gazette I have learned to do an advanced XPath Query to find exactly what I am looking for. The XPath Query involves inputting key words that you intend on looking for that surround the topic that you are focused on. In this analysis project, our focus will be on billiards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially it will be important to do a relatively broad query search. For this project my query search will be just focused on the word “billiards”. From this point on my search would narrow down to search for the word “club” within three words of the word “billiards”. This came with a very narrow list of outputs, allowing me to carefully analyze what types of individuals would be seen at these sporting events. In my experience the word “club” within a few spaces of any sporting event or game would likely mean that the sporting event brought in a relatively large amount of money. On the other hand, this could mean that the individuals participating in the event were wealthy and could afford to bet on games or individuals participating in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My query of billiards would result in about ten searches, sadly with only about four of which contained valuable information about the individuals at the sporting events. The results that I was able to query revealed that many individuals who participated were generals, corporals, or sergeants. This made me curious as to whether or not the army and navy had a larger participation rate than any other class of individuals. In order to query this thought I needed to query the words “sergeant” within three words of “billiard”. This came out with the same results that billiards came out with, but confirmed the thought that billiards participants were predominantly a part of the army and or navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main limitation that I faced while attempting to query was running into such a small pool of results. This proposed that not as many people participated in billiards competitions in comparison to the other popular sports. However, it did not leave me with a large amount of information to analyze. Some of the query outputs that I had in result of my narrowed searches only led me to conclude that the billiard tournaments were typically held in club type of organizations and had some sort of monetary competition involved. The addition of a monetary element could lend a large role as to why the tournaments only involved men of higher positions in the army and or navy. With the higher positions of the men playing in the billiards tournaments could also impact what type of crowd that gathers to watch and likely bid on the men playing in the game. Typically, at the billiards events the men surrounding the wealthy or higher in position men participating in the tournament at hand were men who were in order to the men playing. These men were likely there in support of the men playing in the tournament. At this time having a support system during a particularly difficult billiards event could prove to win the tournament as a whole. Winning a tournament could also impact how individuals view you in the future and who the reigning champion would play in future billiards events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the culture surround Alexandria around the years 1905-1907 there were many factors that played into simple aspects of life. Turnout at a tournament would impact who would play the game and how much would be bid on the game. In the world of billiards, there were never large amounts of people that would come out to the event, due to the exclusivity of a club and who they would let in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparing Location and Speed to Analyze the Effectiveness of Communication</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//p[matches(., &#39;sank&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and matches(., &#39;ship&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]|//p[matches(., &#39;collision&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and matches(., &#39;ship&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]|//p[matches(., &#39;sank&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and matches(., &#39;collision&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]|//p[matches(., &#39;collide&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and matches(., &#39;ship&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]|//p[matches(., &#39;sank&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) and matches(., &#39;collide&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]|//p[matches(., &#39;shipwreck&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query returns 66 different results. The goal of this query is to return as many mentions of shipwrecks and ship collisions as possible. However, some manual filtering is required to get rid of irrelevant results. Once the irrelevant results are removed, there are about 36 different mentions of various shipwrecks that include a location and date. There may be a more concise or effective query than this, so if I come across it I will amend this document to reflect that query’s results instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two bar graphs and one scatterplot. While I could just make a graph of the number of incidents over time based on the issue dates, most of the incidents are not reported on the day they occurred. Obviously, this is because it is nearly impossible to write and publish a newspaper article on something that happened that same day, especially if it happened far away. Because of this, I made a bar graph displaying the number of incidents that occurred in each month.&lt;/p&gt;

      Number of Incidents vs. Month
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The x-axis on the graph separates the results into the twelve months of the year, and the y-axis displays the number of incidents. The shape of the bar graph is somewhat symmetrical and centered around the month of May. I suppose this could be due to more raw materials being exported and imported around the summer months, which would lead to more ships being in use, which would lead to more collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a bar graph depicting the relationship between the number of incidents reported and the day of the week of the issue it was reported in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Number of Reports vs Weekday of Issue
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph is very asymmetrical, with more incidents being reported on Mondays and a general decrease in reported incidents as the week goes by. The fact that more incidents are reported on Mondays than any other day of the week is, most likely, mainly due to the fact that the Egyptian Gazette did not publish issues on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I made a scatterplot depicting the relationship between geographical distance between Cairo and the location of the incident and the time it took for the Egyptian Gazette to report on the incident. I used Google Maps to determine the approximate distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-distance-between-cairo-and-the-incident-vs-time-it-took-to-report&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;distance-vs-time.png&#34; alt=&#34;data visualization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Distance Between Cairo and the Incident vs. Time it Took to Report
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this graph, the x-axis displays the distance (in miles) between Cairo and the incident. The y-axis displays the time it took to report on the incident (likely in days). My hope in making this graph was that there would be a visible pattern in the results that will allow me to infer something about the way these incidents are reported or how information spread at the time. If the correlation between distance and speed was strong and positive, it would mean that the methods of communication used were not very efficient. If there is little or no correlation, then the information spread fast enough for distance to not affect the effectiveness of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After plotting the points on a coordinate plane and calculating a line of best fit and its coefficient of determination (which turned out to be R2= 0.079), it became clear that there was no correlation between the physical distance between Cairo and the incident and the time it took to report on said incident.  This indicates that the spread of information throughout the world was fast enough at the time that an incident happening far away did not determine how long it would take for that information to spread. Therefore, communication during this time period was very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wind speeds in relation to the heat of the sun</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-smith/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-smith/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my subtopic, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to analyze wind speeds in relation to my group&amp;rsquo;s general topic, the heat of the sun. More specifically, I wanted to pick apart data, like from the heat of the sun analysis, and get information that can be used to research upon relating to what I&amp;rsquo;ve analyzed for the heat of the sun. I thought this was a good subtopic in that, maybe the two data sets (wind speeds and the heat of the sun) will conform with one another, or maybe the data is inversely proportional to one in other. With this, it can also question the validity in acquiring this data, through XPath queries. For this, I thought that it would be neat to find a proper credible source that analyzes wind speeds for Alexandria in some arbitrary year, and see if the data trends are the somewhat the same as shown in mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xpath-query&#34;&gt;XPath Query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my XPath Query, like my general topic, I needed something that yielded results that will tangentially represent what we&amp;rsquo;ve researched in our heat of the sun analysis. XPath Query: &lt;code&gt;//table//cell[matches(.,&#39;force of anemometer&#39;, &#39;i&#39;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()&lt;/code&gt;. This query allowed the search engine to find a table and a cell within the table that has the phrase &amp;lsquo;force of anemometer&amp;rsquo; without case sensitivity and from that pick apart the measure from the Anemometer force cell and yield only the numerical value. The results yielded 215 items, however, I only needed to use the results in my [May 1905-April 1906] timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization&#34;&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got my results in the allotted time frame, I put the measures with their respective dates in a spreadsheet and converted the data into a visualization through Tableau. Since we are dealing with many different measures I wanted to take the averages of them rather than listing out all the measures in a graph where the visualization would be a bit messy, so I did averages by month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Line Graph of Averages per month for the Force of Anemometer
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the XPath query and data for both my subtopic and general topic had the same structure, I wanted to make a contrast in the visualization itself, so I made it a line graph, and I thought it looked nicer and more concise than a bar graph. I believe that even though we are dealing with averages, the visualization is enough to provide a bit of context to what the data may entail and does so without making it look too confusing and messy with data points strewed everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-the-visualization-show&#34;&gt;What does the visualization show?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the data visualization, you can notice that an overall trend is shown as the months go by. At the start of the graph, it begins at a high in the Spring months, then decreases down into the colder months then goes back up as Spring season happens again in the following year. From this, we can pick apart some significant meaning as the data somewhat matches up with the data shown in the heat of the sun research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my data brought about some potential significant meaning, I wanted to research &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; wind speeds vary throughout the year. On a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scienceforums.net/topic/69195-higher-wind-speed-in-winter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;science forum&lt;/a&gt;, it discusses the science behind why wind speeds are higher in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much greater variation in barometric pressure during the winter than during the summer. On average, high pressure systems are higher pressure and low pressure systems are lower pressure. This leads to a more rapid flow of air between the systems. This fluctuation is caused by much greater variation in temperature during the winter. While most summer days are roughly the same temperature, winter temperatures fluctuate dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science here shows that winter will always have higher wind speeds due to the temperature differences in the season, whereas in the summer there isn&amp;rsquo;t much difference as the temperatures stay hot. Although this source provides a strong foundation on why wind speeds vary throughout the year, I needed to dig deeper. More specifically, I wanted to find a source that showed me the wind speeds in Alexandria itself from a more credible source than what I worked with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Bar Graph of the Average Wind Speeds by month in Alexandria
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data visualization shown here provides a good reference to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; my visualization should represent, as it is a credible source where the data comes from several stations all across Alexandria. From this, it shows that on average the speeds in the colder months are higher than the hotter months, with a big spike in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does my research say about the heat of the sun in relation to wind speeds? Ultimately, not much. In my data, there were some inconsistencies that thrown the visualization off. My data visualization didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly conform to the science behind wind speeds and the bar graph shown above didn&amp;rsquo;t really match up with my visualization. For example, in my data, there were only 2 data points for November and 6 data points for December to work with and both were relatively low which messed with the averages tremendously as these months, being winter months, are supposed to yield higher averages. These holes and inconsistencies in the data points themselves made the visualization inaccurate, and there really wasn&amp;rsquo;t much I could do about it. In general, there is a relationship between the heat of the sun and wind speeds, as summer months yield lower wind speeds and winter months yield higher wind speeds. This is what my data should have supported, however, with the lack of data in my timeframe in specific months I was unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emotions and Accidents</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-crisafulli/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-crisafulli/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The “Egyptian Gazette” has many stories about various types of accidents that happened all over the world, but mostly in Egypt. However, these focus merely on the accident itself rather than the way it impacted the people involved. For this reason, I wanted to investigate the reactions to different accidents, the extent to which fear is reported in the “Egyptian Gazette”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my research by using the XPath query //head[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;accident&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]. This resulted in 147 articles with the word ‘accident’ in the headline. Rather than read all of these articles I narrowed the search. This was done by using the XPath query //p[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;fear&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;) and matches(.,&amp;lsquo;accident&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)]. This provided me with articles that contained the words fear and accident. Not all of these articles referred to fear within people, so I did not utilize those. To collect further evidence, I replaced the word fear in the XPath query with words such as anxious, terror and shock. To show the various reactions to the accidents I produced a word cloud. The word cloud shows the contrast of the various words used after the accidents, the bigger the word, the more frequently it was found in the paper. However, I wanted to go further into how emotions are used throughout the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/goodvisualization/Sheet4?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are seen throughout the “Egyptian Gazette” in instances without ‘accidents’. I wanted to explore the extent to which emotions are portrayed in relation to accidents or without accidents. For the purpose of this examination I am defining the word accident as an unfortunate accident, typically resulting in damage or an injury. I used various XPath queries to find this information. I used the query //p[matches(.,&amp;lsquo;fear&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;) and matches(.,&amp;lsquo;accident&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;)] to find the emotions in relation to accidents. I took off the matches ‘accident’ part of the query to find the emotions in the paper as a whole. I searched the complete working to set in order to accumulate the most accurate data possible. Once I collected the data, I made a visualization showing the difference in the amount of times a word was used in relation to an accident as compared to without an accident. I made a data table in excel and then used tableau to produce a line graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/goodvisualization/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the articles I came across in my initial search for paragraphs containing fear and accident had a blog post written about it. The Chatham Explosion, had a three column story written about in the September 29th 1905 issue. There was a blog post written about it. In the article it is said that the people were “fearing accidents” and “anxious”. In the blog post written about this accident, it is shown that people were anxious about the explosion but it was not as extreme as anticipated. This could be why they were not using emotion words such as dread but rather anxious, as it was not a very extreme disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading some of the articles about the various accidents, that included an emotion or reaction I found that many people felt fearful especially after a “nearly fatal” accident. Fear is a natural response to almost dying so this makes sense. However, I was really questioning why they were merely fearful, could a stronger emotion have been used? To learn more about the history of emotions in this time period and in Egypt I went searching for outside sources. I was shown a study that examined and compared varying emotions. In a way they were rating or ranking different emotions. Using the HEEM (Historical Embodied Emotions Model) this study classified emotions. They had 37 classes of emotions, one class being fear. This study compared negative and positive emotion words and looked at their frequencies. Throughout the “Egyptian Gazette”, I was looking at emotions that would all be considered negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found a book specifically about the history of emotions in Cairo. Emotional Cities: Debates on Urban Change in Berlin and Cairo, 1860-1910, was written by Joseph Ben Prestel, about the history of emotions in this time period. While I could not manage to get a full copy of the book I was able to find a pdf summary and use this information to better my own analysis. In this work he focused on emotions as a physical concept rather than something moral or spiritual. Prestel utilized urban planning and culture to examine emotions and their extremity. While this is an intriguing way to analyze the emotions at the time, it is not necessarily the same thing I am analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, emotions are a very complex topic to analyze in a newspaper. By analyzing emotions many questions arise as to why they were feeling these emotions and how extreme they really are. By looking at emotion words in relation to accidents and without accidents I was able to evaluate the extent to which emotions were seen throughout the newspaper as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Accidental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-accidents/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-accidents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Egyptian Gazette, accidents are a recurring topic with a wide variety of types, severities, and locations, with different events getting different levels of attention and description. This group analysis project investigates accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette at the turn of the 20th century through several different lenses. These lenses can be broken into three main categories: 1) Investigating particular types of accidents: fires, ships and railways; 2) Investigating the language around accidents: linguistic descriptors and emotions portrayed; and 3) Investigating the locations of reported accidents. These three categories come together to create a broad encompassing analysis of accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire-related accidents is one of the chosen subtopics of this project. Data about this topic was made into a visualization and compared side-to-side with one another to easily discern patterns in the data such as what times of the year fire accidents were frequently reported. These patterns were then analyzed to estimate what could have caused these increased frequencies of fire accident reports. The ability of the fire brigade to fight these fires was also examined and what effect this what effect this ability or inability would have had on the peace of mind of people in Alexandria at the time. In my analysis I found that there was an increased number of fires during the summer and winter seasons. This pattern could be the result of a number of factors, but I think a sensible conclusion would be that the warm summer temperatures directly caused more fires and the cold temperatures and less daylight of winter caused people to light fireplaces and candles more often, thus indirectly causing more fires. This subtopic directly relates to the overall topic, the social history of accidents in Alexandria, because it involves the gathering of data about a specific type of accident and attempts to look at the subtopic from the point of view of someone living in Alexandria at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ship accidents that happen, considering the fact that Egypt exports and imports many goods. Most of these accidents are collisions involving one ship sinking, but there are several that involve two or more ships. Regardless, this type of accident is usually worth reporting to the general public. However, the Egyptian Gazette does not always immediately report on these incidents. A lot of the reports reach the Gazette through telegrams, but often times it takes more than just several days to form and publish an article. I made a scatterplot depicting the relationship between geographical distance between Cairo and the location of the incident and the time it took for the Egyptian Gazette to report on the incident. My hope in making this graph was that there would be a visible pattern in the results that will allow me to infer something about the way these incidents are reported or how information spread at the time. If the correlation between distance and speed was strong and positive, it would mean that the methods of communication used were not very efficient. If there was little or no correlation, then the information spread fast enough for distance to not affect the effectiveness of communication. The correlation for the line of best fit for this scatterplot was very weak, with the R2 value being 0.079. Because of this, I concluded that the time it takes to publish an article is not correlated with the physical distance between Cairo and the incident. This lack of correlation relates to social history because it could be a good representation of how information spread in the early 20th century. Obviously, the spread of information was much slower in that time period compared to now, but the technology had advanced enough for the spread of information to be unaffected by distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Egyptian Gazette, there are many instances of reported railway accidents. To analyze this type of accident, I formed a data set of 32 rail-related accidents reported in the newspaper from 1905-1907. Using this data, I investigated the geographical locations, the types of accidents, and the monthly prevalence of these railway accidents. To analyze the geographical locations, I mapped all the reported rail accidents. This revealed that the overwhelming majority, 26 out of 32, of the reported accidents occurred in Egypt. Internationally reported events often involved royalty, or someone else of wealth, or was a dramatically tragic event, such as the death of dozens or of a child. Within my data set, I found four main types of accidents reported on: those caused by a crash, derailment, unfastened door, or, the most prevalent of those reported, someone being run over. Monthly prevalence of these events did not follow any apparent trend, either proof of an incomplete data set or a lack of correlation between the time of the year and prevalence of accidents. Through my research, particularly looking at the distinctions in how railway-caused deaths were reported, I found what appeared to be a significant class distinction. Events relating to the upper-class often got notable publicity and detailed writing, while those relating to the working-class and others did not receive the same coverage, often reported very briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that can be used to describe accidents is the linguistic descriptions of the accidents within the Egyptian Gazette. I searched for the word “accident” in XML with restrictions to headers with “head.” This resulted in 145 items. Since I was looking at the language and at different terms, I didn’t actually find a perfect way to query for the descriptions of the accidents. The results of the accident query were put into Atom and the data was then cut down to just those descriptions before the word “accident” and put them into a word cloud and used Tableau’s charts. The data given shows what type of language the newspaper uses the most to draw attention or to give readers a sense of tragedy or shock. Fatal, railway, motor, and tram were amongst the highest in frequency. This shows that accidents were mostly described as near-death and impactful, possibly attract more readers to the story and signal to them an interesting subject. Categorization among these terms between type (railway, motor, etc) and description (fatal, etc) would possibly give more about what type of accident occurs more and perhaps needs more safety regulations. The top 25 recurring words were taken (which is where the frequency of words for headlines is more than one). The top 25 recurring words for headlines versus whole paragraphs showed only four that corresponded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo; are a couple of the top words for paragraphs, &amp;ldquo;fatal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;motor&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;tram&amp;rdquo; were top words for headlines. Fatal may be a signal descriptor for readers to look for when reading about accidents and their results. The top words also show that there is a high probability that most recurring accidents are firstly train accidents and secondly motor accidents. The top words matching words were &amp;ldquo;cairo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;injured&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; show again that train accidents occur the most and are presented most frequently, and mostly occur in Cairo. Cairo is possibly the most talked about area and/or the area with the most accidents- maybe the most with train accidents. “Injured” shows that maybe readers are mostly specifically looking for the results of accidents and how they affect people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotions of the people involved in the accidents was not explained in great detail throughout the “Egyptian Gazette”. However, there are some emotions shown in relation to accidents. Fear was the most common emotion word I found in relation to accidents. The history or emotions is hard to analyze especially when very few emotions are portrayed through newspaper articles. Within the articles that contained both an emotion, such as fear or shock, and an accident, I found that there was little importance placed on the emotion. The articles gave more focus to the accident itself. Even when the accidents were more extreme, or “nearly fatal” the people were only fearful or anxious. The emotions were not that intense but were all negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accidents that the “Egyptian Gazette” reported on occurred in a wide variety of locations across the globe. The most common locations were Cairo, London, Alexandria, and Liverpool. This makes sense because Cairo was the largest and most important city in Egypt, Alexandria was the home of the newspaper, and London and Liverpool were the two most prominent cities in England. The “Egyptian Gazette” catered to a largely British audience, being as it was an English language newspaper and Egypt was a British Protectorate. There was also a substantial amount of accidents that occurred in the Nile River Delta, Britain as a whole, and the Middle East, which makes sense because these regions are geographically closest to Alexandria. There was also a small amount of reporting on accidents in North America and Eastern Asia, especially India. Notably absent from the data are Australia, South America,  Western Africa, and the Siberian region. This is likely due to the fact that these regions of the world were not as industrialized at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen through these six lenses, accidents were a common occurrence reported on in the Egyptian Gazette and their effects and other implications can be demonstrated by the way they are reported throughout the newspaper in the years 1905-1907 in Alexandria, Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Railway Accidents from 1905-1907</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-grant/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-grant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Egyptian Gazette, I came across many instances of rail-related accidents. The seemingly prevalent issue caught my attention and initiated my analysis on railway accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907. This analysis attempts to add to the knowledge and research on this topic by looking at the geographical locations of rail accidents reported, the types of rail accidents reported on, and when during the year these accidents occurred. I will then use my findings and the research of others to contextualize these rail accidents, looking at how railway development and their workers have been reported on in the Egyptian Gazette, and the, perhaps, limited scope that this provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methods&#34;&gt;Research Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my analysis, I will briefly explain some of my research methods. To compile the data set used for this analysis, I used the XPath query: &lt;code&gt;//div//head[matches(.,&#39;accident&#39;,&#39;i&#39;)]/following-sibling::p[matches(.,&#39;train&#39;,&#39;i&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt; to search for all articles with a headline containing the word &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo; and a paragraph containing the word &amp;ldquo;train.&amp;rdquo; This search gave me 47 results. To create as complete a data set as possible, I tried several variation of this search, which resulted in seven more articles. After excluding irrelevant articles, I ultimately resulted in a data set of 32 railway accidents reported in the Egyptian Gazette from 1905-1907. This data served as the core for my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geographical-locations&#34;&gt;Geographical Locations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking at the locations of railway accidents reported on, the overwhelming majority, 26 out of 32, occurred within Egypt, with 11 being reported under the “Local and General” feature. This suggests that the people reading the Egyptian Gazette cared more about that which pertained to them and their locale than they cared about events unrelated to themselves, when it came to railway accidents. However, international accidents were reported on too. Specifically, six of the 32 reported on occurred outside of Egypt (Sudan, Syria, Israel, France, England x2 ). These international events often involved royalty, or someone else of wealth, or was a tragic event, such as the death of dozens of people or a child. Other than England and France, the other countries reported on were in close proximity to Egypt. The inclusion of these two European countries demonstrates the newspaper’s audience’s connection to colonial Britain. I have mapped all the reported railway accidents to the best of my ability. This involved updating some city names to their modern spellings and marking all accidents found in “Local and General” as occurring in Alexandria. These approximations seem accurate as one can nearly trace a line between the locations in and around the Nile Delta, many of which follow along water ways or in clear paths, indicating that a rail line may have existed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/TrainAccidents/LocationalPrevalenceReportedOn?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-accidents&#34;&gt;Types of Accidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were four main types of accidents reported on. Those caused by a crash, derailment, unfastened door, or, the most prevalent of those reported, someone being run over. In the bar graph below, one can see the number of times each type of accident was reported on over the three years, broken down by the outcome of that accident: No Injuries, Injury, or Death. Cases where there were both injuries and deaths were counted as a “Death.” This breakdown shows that most of the accidents reported on resulted in an injury or worse. Most of the “No Injuries” were crashes or derailments of goods trains. Also frequently mentioned, was the delay that the accident caused, such as on September 15, 1905 when a train derailed, resulting in “an hour and twenty minutes late in arrival in Alexandria.” This further demonstrates the idea that what is considered newsworthy is that with dramatic outcomes or an impact to one’s daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/TrainAccidents/NumberofTimesTypesofAccidentsareReported?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monthly-prevalence&#34;&gt;Monthly Prevalence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also investigated when these accidents occurred and their prevalence in the newspaper at that time. To prevent results skewed by one year simply having more or less issues, I graphed the number of accidents reported divided by the total number of issues for that month to find the fraction of issues that contain a reference to a railway accident. This resulted in the following graph that shows spikes and falls, but does not reveal a common trend. Perhaps if all the months contained fuller daily data, a clearer trend would appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/TrainAccidents-ReportingFrequency/ReportingFrequency?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;contextualization-and-final-analysis&#34;&gt;Contextualization and Final Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my research I was expecting an overwhelming disapproval or blame of railway workers for these accidents. This assumption came from my early findings on workers being reported as &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-17-damiangrant/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“careless”&lt;/a&gt; and from Ziad Fahmy’s published journal entry in which he states that, “The general feeling of disenfranchisement, … were subtly blamed on British wartime rationing and foreign-owned capital,” such as the railways. However, this was not clearly confirmed nor denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many instances of railway workers’ deaths being mentioned briefly and without much regard, which may indicate a lack of empathy or care for this group of people. But, this was also common throughout the paper for other people as well. There were also instances in which railway workers were talked about with respect, such as when they did a good job caring for the first-class after the derailment of a sleeping car or when the driver of a train broke his arm. Rather than showing a consistent, strong feeling towards railway workers, these instances hint at an important class distinction, in which events relating to the upper-class get more publicity and detailed writing, while the working-class and others do not receive the same coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While analyzing the Egyptian Gazette gives insight into Alexandria at the turn of the century, it is important to note that it is just one point of view from a diverse city. The ease of transportation granted by railways enabled British colonialism over Egypt during this time, something many Egyptian Gazette readers likely were aware of. As explained by On Barak, these transportation lines were so essential that a series of strikes in 1919 which “paralyzed transportation inside and between cities” caused “British rule in its current form” to become “impossible.” It would be interesting to see how railway workers and rail-related accidents were reported on in other newspapers, particularly those not designed for a British, English speaking audience. I predict that there would be greater negative coverage of railway workers and accidents as a form of criticism and disapproval of British control in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alexandria Fire Accidents</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-walter/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-walter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of my project is to analyze fire accidents reported by the Egyptian Gazette and find patterns in the months and years that they occurred in. I also tried to uncover how proficient the fire brigade was at the time and determine if the losses from these fires were partly a result of inadequate preparedness. To accomplish these tasks, I first searched the Egyptian Gazette repository using the XPath query //p[contains(., &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo;) and contains(., &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo;) or contains(., &amp;ldquo;fire brigade&amp;rdquo;)]. I originally searched divs instead of paragraphs, but this search yielded many irrelevant results pertaining to fire insurance and other advertisements. Searching paragraphs seemed to give much more relevant results. This yielded 58 results which was filtered to 53 results after removing articles on subsequent days referring to the same incident. I saved these 53 results and removed any information unnecessary to data visualization, leaving only the year, month, and day of the incident. This data was then visualized in bar graphs below representing fires reported by year and month.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In examining the first graph, the amount of reported fire accidents seems to be fairly steady across the three years. However, upon examination of the second graph, there seems to be a spike in reported fires in the month of June. This could have been the result of multiple factors, but the city of Alexandria would’ve been in the midst of summer during this month and the high temperatures associated with the season seems to be the most probable cause of the spike. There also seems to be a relative spike of reported fire accidents in the months of winter, which is likely the result of people lighting their fireplaces at night to avoid cold temperatures and from people lighting their lamps and candles more often due to less daily sunlight. These visualizations obviously don’t provide any indication of the proficiency of the fire brigade at this time, but it does accomplish my first goal of finding patterns in the data visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine the reported proficiency of the fire brigade in Alexandria at the time, I searched the repository with a much simpler XPath query: //p[contains(., &amp;ldquo;fire brigade&amp;rdquo;)].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the context of each result, I noticed that most results had either good or neutral remarks about the fire brigade’s proficiency. In fact, there was an entire article praising the fire brigade’s competency. Among the negative remarks was an article explaining in detail how the fire brigade (and police department) was completely unprepared to put out a fire. According to the article, the fire brigade was immediately notified of the emergency but did not show up until 2 hours after the alarm. A few policemen were present at the fire after coincidentally strolling past it but did absolutely nothing about it until 30 minutes after it had started. In fact, they made the situation worse by instructing men from the power company, who started fighting the fire 5 minutes after it had started, to leave the scene. Among the query results were some unexpected articles explaining how the city of Alexandria itself was ill-equipped to combat fires at the time. I read a few articles explaining how there weren’t enough fire hydrants in the city, which meant the fire brigade had to attach their hoses to the hydrants from long distances before they could start fighting the fire. There were also articles stating that the roads were blocked by trees, rocks, and other debris that the fire engines couldn’t pass through. At the time, the city of Alexandria was in the process of constructing granite roads in place of their previous dirt ones. The road closures associated with this construction could have inhibited the movement of the fire engines, but an article by the Mediterranean Historical Review presents another road issue. According to the article, Scraping the surface: the techno-politics of modern streets in turn-of-twentieth-century Alexandria, “In wintertime the city’s dirt roads would become so muddy that pedestrians and beasts of burden had trouble advancing, and wheeled vehicles could hardly move at all.” This would have greatly inhibited the fire brigade’s ability to do their job and would have been made worse as the winters seemed to experience a greater frequency of fires as explained above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After examining the data collected, I concluded that the fire brigade demonstrated great performance in most reported circumstances. There were some articles explaining where they fell short, but that can be said of any governmental organization. The major problem at the time seemed to be inadequacy of roads and equipment rather than the fire brigade itself. From the perspective of civilians living in Alexandria at the time, the fact that their fire brigade was skillful at what they did must have been led to a peace of mind, reassuring that a fire would be swiftly dealt with whenever one arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis on this topic could be improved in the future by compiling fire accident reports from multiple newspapers in the city of Alexandria into data visualizations similar the ones above. However, this method may come with inaccuracies as it would be difficult to detect multiple newspapers reporting on the same incident, which may result in bias in the visualization towards larger incidents that more newspapers would have reported on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cholera</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-himmel/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-himmel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cholera&#34;&gt;Cholera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholera is a bacterial infection that leads to an acute diarrheal disease that dehydrates and can kill the infected within hours.  Today, it is estimated that there are 1.3 to 4 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths worldwide due to cholera, in mostly socially undeveloped areas (Cholera).  In &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, there are 171 references to the disease ranging from a variety of topics.  Some, if not most of our sample of the Gazette refers to where the disease is spotted in the world and if it threatens Alexandria, Egypt.  Other mentions describe how modern medicine understands the disease and advertisements for medication claiming to remedy cholera amongst other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/mapcholera/Sheet1?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on in our sample of &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, there is a spike in the mentions of the disease cholera, mostly in the months of August through October 1905.  All of these mentions in this timeframe describe how cholera is ravaging throughout Europe.  Several articles detail its spread geographically throughout northeastern Europe.  For example, in a September, 19th 1905 edition of the newspaper, an article titled “The Cholera Scare” describes a “recent outbreak of cholera in Russia and Germany [that] has caused quite a scare throughout Europe, and it [had] behov[ed] the Sanitary Department to take prompt measures to prevent the dread malady appearing in Egypt…”.  The article later goes on to describe how past epidemics have plagued Egypt, describing the other instances with death tolls in the several tens of thousands.  The article further states that “It is worthy of note that the disease in this country has invariably broken out in the hot months, and disappeared with the advent of cold weather, so that it is reasonable to assume that we shall be spared any visitation [of cholera] this year.”  This prediction proves to be true because there are no mentions of cholera infecting anybody in Egypt within this timeframe, in fact there are articles refuting any rumors that cholera has been spotted in Egypt in this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From November 1905 to December 1907, there are very few mentions of cholera, most mentions in this timeframe are from either advertisements, or articles describing what is known about cholera and disease in general.  An article from January 26th, 1908 titled “Mosquitoes in Egypt” tells of the need for education for better sanitary practices for the prevention of diseases from coming into Egypt.  Another article called “Egypt’s Curse” from a September 11th issue of the Gazette details the new science of “bacteriology” and what is known about how bacteria work and how they might have survived in a suspended state of animation from the preservation of mummies.  The bacterial resistance of cholera is discussed saying that the bacteria vary in how resistant they are.  Some bacteria seem to perish after only a few hours and some lasted up to eight months with the various experiments that scientists have conducted on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/cholera_15753985669840/Sheet1?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbh18g/analysis/master/19-analysis-Himmel/%20Chlorodyne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dr. J. Collis Brown&amp;amp;rsquo;s Chlorodyne&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one advertisement claims to remedy cholera, diarrhea, colic, and dysentery, and that product is Dr. J. Collis Brown’s Chlorodyne.  Surprisingly enough, the product is only advertised fourteen times over the three years or so of the newspaper that has been encoded.  Further research into Chlorodyne revealed that the medication was an effective treatment for these diseases as well as other ailments not listed in the advertisements.  The reasoning behind its effectiveness were the active ingredients being opiates and marijuana (McCabe, 1979) .  Interestingly enough this advertisement that claims to remedy cholers do not seem to have any correlation to when cholera was mentioned more frequently in the newspaper, even as fears of cholera began to spread within Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/mapcholera/Sheet12?:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the last month of 1907, cholera outbreaks began to pop up in places close to and in Egypt, namely one case in Suez, Egypt and 34 deaths in the port-town of Sinope, Turkey.  After the new year rolled around, a plethora of cases began to pop up in Mecca and Djeddah, Saudi Arabia.  Almost every day, new reports coming in from those areas tell of plague and death.  These areas are very close to Alexandria and in response, the Sanitary Department of Alexandria has issued a warning of an impending outbreak in the area.  This is particularly interesting because the precautions that the newspaper reports on seem very obvious to someone in today’s time, but may have been completely foreign to readers at this time.  Some of the actions the Sanitary Department advises are to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash hands after using the restroom and before eating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat only well-cooked food and avoid unfiltered water, uncooked milk and butter, and fruits and vegetables that cannot be cooked or peeled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid an excess of food, and cold beverages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek medical attention with the slighted suspicion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not allow servants to go out without changing clothes and washing hands and don’t allow them to bring anyone back with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as if in later issues of the Gazette there might be more reporting of cholera in the following months to come, possibly some in Alexandria itself.  Since the content repository only goes up to Febuary, 1st 1908, I can only get data on cholera up to this point.  However, the data suggests that there will be a an outbreak soon due to to the Sanitary Department releasing a statement to get prepared for an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accidents Linguistics</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-nguyen/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-nguyen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One aspect that can be used to describe accidents is the linguistic descriptions of the accidents within the Egyptian Gazette. The most descriptive terms come prior to the word “accident,” so the best start to using XML and querying was to search for “accident” and restrict it to headers with “head.” This resulted in 145 items. This was then copied and pasted into atom. Atom was used to cut the extra text down to the words in between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; in the Description lines by searching the buffer for the System ID: line, Match:, Start line, and Length line and replacing them all with empty space. The only lines saved were those containing “accident” or “accidents.” I did not take into consideration the possibility of “accident” being misspelled in a way that Atom couldn’t recognize. Articles like 14 “the”s were replaced. 12 “a”s were erased by using \sa\s (blank space, a, blank space) so as not to replace a’s within words. They were replaced with empty space. All periods were erased by turning off regex and were replaced with empty space. I found XML language stuck in the buffer somehow (Match:) by using &amp;lt;\w+. I was unsure of how to do a full erasure from &amp;lt; to &amp;gt; and end header, but there were only three lines, so I simply erased them.  One was “Description.” All were replaced with empty space.  I then used Atom to find \r\n\r\n to replace the long empty spaces with \n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem I approached were the spaces in front of lines that I had caused from replacing A’s with a space. I didn’t know of a way to fix this automatically without redoing all of the previous work, so I replaced them by hand with \s. Double spaces were replaced with one space too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saving this file, I opened a new file and copied over same saved data. I deleted all “to”s with /sto/s and all the “at”s with \sat\s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I erased all the “accident” and “accidents” because I only wanted the descriptions in the visual representation since the subject was the descriptions rather than the word accident itself. I deleted leftover spaces individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After inserting the list into wordcloud.com, I encountered another problem: the same words showed up more than once if they were fully capitalized or fully in lowercase or even had only the first letter capitalized.
I then used the shortcut using the Shift key and F3 which put the entire list in all caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem was encountered: some ”common words” are actually connected to the primary words, which is fine to just look and add back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem: some of these words have the same meaning, i.e. drowning and bathing, motor and car, car and tramway probably refer to the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was put into an excel spreadsheet and connected that to tableau by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deleted the “ on “implacable inside tableau to keep ABC order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;accident\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?\w?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this long stretch of text, I erased words that included the word “accident” such as the word itself and “accidents”, “accidentally”, etc. (under “accident p”, xml was for paragraphs (and heads) containing the word “accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…” was erased. One trouble I don’t know how to solve was capturing the whole paragraph instead of just parts of it. I think this should suffice as the best option, since trying to capture the entire paragraphs in other ways lead to only obtaining lines that didn’t have the word “accident” at all. .
T
he next step is to have the words counted and categorized and graphed, and top words compared to the simple list of words previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“one” and “two” and the number “0” are excluded from the top word frequency list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replaced \r\n with empty space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replaced empty spaces with a single space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“- “ erased because it is mostly signaling words that are split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are words that are in the headlines that correspond to the whole paragraph, but aren’t necessarily top twenty-five, but there are scarcely any words that were frequent in the paragraph that are frequent for the headlines. Out of the top twenty-five reoccurring words for each, only four have corresponded. Top 25 happen to be where the frequency of words for headlines is more than one. Since paragraphs contained higher counts of words like &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo;, but headlines contained higher counts of  &amp;ldquo;fatal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;motor&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;tram&amp;rdquo;, one can see that the word &amp;ldquo;fatal&amp;rdquo; is a signal for readers that there is an important accident. This also shows that there is a high probability that most reoccurring accidents are firstly train accidents and secondly motor accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the top four words in common be &amp;ldquo;cairo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;injured&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; show again that train accidents occur the most and are presented most frequently, as well as having a strong basis in Cairo. &amp;ldquo;Injured&amp;rdquo; is a common word used for both show and description- a signal for readers that a person was affected but also a common description for readers to catch onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &amp;ldquo;Reported Accidents, Incidents, Tragedies, and Disasters&amp;rdquo;, accidents can be categorized under &amp;ldquo;vehicles&amp;rdquo; or general headlines (Cannon). The author discussed that accidents are also described using different words such as &amp;ldquo;incidents&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;tragedies&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;disasters.&amp;rdquo; This shows that there can be many missing descriptions or occurrences that I missed due to language variations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egypt Stocks &amp; Shares</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-kim/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-kim/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Question: How well would you fare if you invested in the biggest bank in Egypt at the start of 1906?&lt;/strong&gt;
Expanding on our group project, which was referring to the highest and lowest producing stocks in the stock market in 1906; I wanted to look further into this and see how well you could do with Bank stocks as I noticed throughout the months, while finishing my deliverables, that the banks were heavily advertised and very involved within Egypt’s economy. I looked through the “Stocks and Shares” table in quarter one of 1906 to get the most accurate results. This table not only showed the stock prices but the debentures and well. A stock is basically the digital equivalent of owning a part of a company for which they are able to buy and sell as they wish. A debenture is essentially the same thing but more similar to a bond in that it is everything that a bond is but also secured by assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this project was basically to show how one would do by investing in the financial sector in the time of rebuilding as Egypt was still going through an economic overhaul led by the British. After the war of 1882 with the British, Egypt was taken over and made as a project by the British to rebuild the declining economy starting with their very important cotton industry. Another reason I decided to ask this question is because while Egypts economy was beginning to suffer and their recession in 1907 was becoming apparent, I wanted to see how a financial stock would fare against negative investor sentiment. The recession trend was also very similar to the US financial crisis of 2008. There is a parallel as the crisis bled into everyday life and affected almost everyone apart of the economy. Both Egypt and the US economy suffered greatly from the recessions and bled more and more everyday. The one key difference was that while the financial sector, specifically the bank stocks were hit the hardest in the US crisis; in Egypt there was really no sector at fault. To go ahead and find out the answer to my question, I decided to do a little research on each of the stocks in the financial sector at the time and figure out which made the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the &lt;em&gt;National Bank of Egypt&lt;/em&gt; because it is the biggest and oldest bank in Egypt and would give me the best results in terms of the financial sector as it is a solid indicator for the sector as a whole.
Stemming from my project, the query: //div[@xml:id=&amp;ldquo;deg-el-stsh01&amp;rdquo;]/table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;National Bank of Egypt.&amp;rsquo;)]/preceding-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would allow me to see the changes in the prices of the bank shares and the growth or decline of the share as each week went by. This allowed me to also see the visualization as a graph and a trendline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock is clearly a growth stock and an indicator of a winner as it has a positive trend.
From this visualization, it is obvious, in a small sample size, that the stock is a survivor during a bear market and a great recession-resistant stock. For historical context, The National Bank of Egypt, in 1906, established in Addis Ababa, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofabyssinia.com/index.php/profile/company-profile.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bank of Abyssinia.&lt;/a&gt; This bank was able to be granted a 50 year monopoly and became the Ethiopian government fiscal agent as well as the only issuer of currency. It was the most respected commercial bank in Egypt because it was never separated from the national concerns or issues. It has also been the main supporter of Egypts very important national economy by helping finance its major projects. This backed with the fact that it moved the majority of Egypts banking assets, deposits, loans, and advances at the time, it was a safe bet during the recession. So how would I do if I decided to jump the gun and invested in the biggest and oldest bank in Egypt? Not only would I do well, I would be beating the market average by a mile and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an expansion to my reasoning for this project, I wanted to credit a second source that was actually suggested to me by Mr. Hanley himself. I remembered Professor Hanley mentioning during our Blog Post project that we should try and find other blog posts similar to ours and during my search, I found a source that I kept just in case for my analysis project because I knew I was going to do something on the stock market. It just turned out that my group was also in agreeance with me and coincidentally agreed on a question very similar to the following source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-metallo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stocks and Shares&lt;/a&gt; I just wanted to give thanks to &lt;em&gt;Sophia Metallo&lt;/em&gt; (the author of the blog post) as I was able to pull very valuable information from the work and use it as guidance for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Humidity and its relation to cotton yields</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-thomas/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-thomas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humidity in and of itself does not have a strong correlation to cotton yields due to the fact that humidity by itself does not affect cotton. Germination of a cotton seed and the subsequent sprouting and ripening of that seed cannot be affected by the air’s relative humidity. The only thing that could possibly be affected by humidity if the quality of the cotton. For example, if the cotton was soaked through due to the humidity and therefore lost some of its inherent integrity as a fiber. However, humidity does in fact inform the analyst of one thing and that is whether there was rainfall and how frequently that rainfall was taking place. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smartfog.com/how-rain-and-humidity-connected.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Smart Fog&lt;/a&gt; “When it rains, it will increase the relative humidity because of the evaporation. The air where the rain is falling may not be completely saturated with water vapor. However, the longer it rains, the more the humidity will increase because of the air constantly drawing the water.” Using this knowledge inferences can be made about rainfall as humidity increases across a certain time period and in turn see rainfalls effect on cotton yields. This roundabout, estimative way of seeing how rainfall affects cotton yields is necessary due to the fact that there is minimal rainfall data throughout the Egyptian Gazette so far as people have either not entered it in or left the template as it was. However, using this method there can at least be some inference about rainfall and its amounts and effect on cotton yield using secondary sources to add where the estimate lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

According to data gathered through Xpath queries executed on the Egyptian Gazette content repository which queried the tables that contained figures for cotton exports and recorded the sums found in each issue pairing them to the dates that they were found, Cotton yields were the highest in January. So high in fact that the amounts recorded outstrip the second highest value by more than twice that values amount. This implies that humidity and in turn rainfall was at optimal levels which according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.organiccotton.org/oc/Cotton-general/Plant-and-fibres/Plant-requirements.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Organic cotton&lt;/a&gt; is about 500mm of water between germination and boll formation. Yields then begin to fall to their lowest recorded in March but then rise to more than triple that amount by May. They then fall to almost half of May’s yields by July but almost rises back to May’s amounts in just one month in August but then fall by even lower than half in just one month to September. The least drastic difference occurs between September and October where compared to the other months it’s just a small rise in cotton yields.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Data gathered through the same method used to find data on cotton yields on humidity yielded much less exciting results as the average humidity throughout the months looks much different than the cotton yields. However, data can still be extracted from the results gathered. The graph shows a relative decrease in the average humidity from January to July and a relative increase from July to October. The humidity then begins on a decrease again from November to December which can be inferenced to be part of the relative decrease from January to July.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/precipitation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;trading economics&lt;/a&gt; , which is an online platform that provides historical data, economic forecasts, news, and trading recommendations across 196 countries, the relative increase and decrease of precipitation in Egypt in 1907 corresponds with the relative increases and decreases in humidity as shown in the humidity percentage graph. This supports the theory that by measuring the humidity fluctuations over each month it can be estimated whether it is raining more or less in a specific time period. Through both the graph of rainfall and the graph of humidity it can be inferred that relative rainfall was decreasing from January to July and increasing from July to October. Comparing this with the cotton exports graph shows very little correlation between cotton exports and humidity. The turning points of the cotton exports graph and the relative decreases and increases found in the humidity and rainfall graphs do not line up very well in the slightest. This suggests that either humidity and rainfall in Egypt don’t affect cotton growth very much or the way that the data itself is flawed in some way. This could be further investigated by making sure every humidity and cotton export value in every table analyzed is correct when compared to the page images the date is supposed to be taken from and/or doing the same for rainfall and correcting every rainfall value to see If rainfall may be different than what was found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/precipitation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;trading economics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Alexandria, Egypt (May 1906-April 1907)</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hernandez/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-hernandez/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, the topic of global warming has gotten huge publicity all around the world. This analysis was created with the purpose of finding out whether or not global warming has been occuring specifically in Alexandria, Egypt by taking data found from May 1906 to April 1907 and comparing it to an article I found that lists the temperature change in Alexandria Egypt over the last 100 years to see if there has been an increase in the average temeperature and if so what could be the leading factors in the climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xpath-query&#34;&gt;XPath Query&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xpath Queries I have chosen to use are:
1.Max Temps: //table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;Max. Temp in the shade&amp;rsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()&lt;br&gt;
2.Min Temps: //table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;Min. Temp in the shade&amp;rsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the query is to find a certain table in the newspaper which shows the weather information  which typically is found on page 2-3 and from that, I would take the data that is under the maximum  and minimum temperature section. By taking the following sibling cell after the cell that says max temperature and minimum temperature, I will be able to gather the numbers provided and copy and paste them into Atom to then use them to create useful visualizations. The Xpath query had to be narrowed down to keywords such as the exact titles of the weather report or else the information could be skewed. Another important thing in making the query was making sure that the results that were given back were in numbers so it would not mess up the graph if someone would have written something in that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-visualization&#34;&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the data I have gathered was far too large to display one by one on the bar graph, I had to split it up into months and show the average temperature of each month. While looking through the data individually, I found that there were very few giant errors in the numbers provided which made the graphs look a lot smoother than if otherwise it had a giant spike out of nowhere. From the graphs we can interpret that the temperature reaches its peak in July and goes through a steady decline until february and after february it starts to increase back up and keeps following this cycle. When looking at the minimum temperature it looks a little odd how it goes from a steady decrease from July to November, then a huge drop in December and then goes back up in January and then declines again afterwards. It is a very confusing pattern. It may have to do because of the lack of dates around the time which lead to a skewed average or just a cold front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/t/alainhernandez/views/MaxTemperature/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/t/alainhernandez/views/mintemperature/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;significance-of-the-data&#34;&gt;Significance of the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data found in this Xpath query was useful in trying to find out the patterns of temperature in Alexandria Egypt over the span of a year. This data gave a clearer picture of how the climate in Egypt didn&amp;rsquo;t change drastically since of its geographical location being in the desert. It never really got too cold but you could a gradual decrease in temperature over the winter time and gradual increase in temperature over the summer time. This data will be useful in determining whether or not these patterns are supported by an outside source that probably has more accurate information on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-context&#34;&gt;Historical Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seasonal-temperature-trends-and-Mann-Kendall-test-for-trend-Z-test-and-rate-of_tbl2_303018027&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Temperature Patterns in Egypt over the past 100 years&lt;/a&gt;
This article shows the trends of temperature from 1900 to 2010 in Alexandria, Egypt and other parts of Egypt. This article shows the bigger picture of the climate change that has been happening in Egypt using a larger sample size than the one we used in the analysis project.
To make a conclusion about global warming being present in my data would be difficult to do because the data I have is limited and I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough data to show the change from one year to another so my sample size is very limited in what it represents but it works with the article I have provided to show the bigger picture of how a gradual increase of temeprature has been occuring in certain areas of Egypt in every single season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-remarks&#34;&gt;Research Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing this research, there were a few remarks that I would like to point out regarding the accuracy of a given data element and how that can ultimately skew your research. Initially, as I began constructing my XPath Query, as I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed before, the data isn&amp;rsquo;t always perfect. The query did not yield results for every single day in all 3 years. The results were dense in the earlier years but as time went by, that data began to thin out, making it very difficult to pick apart data that can accurately represent what I am trying to research. Even though the data that was presented, yielded, some of the measures were wrong, due to human error. For me, as I was dealing with averages across each month, the human error threw my data visualization off-proportion, in which I had to change. I am by no means saying that these digital methods of acquiring data are bad. In fact, the ability to use a query to yield results from various newspapers over several years is very efficient. However, a weakness of researching through digital methods is that the data presented isn&amp;rsquo;t always accurate, questioning the validity and accuracy of the research itself. Furthermore, the data could be missing, also highlighting the inaccuracy of the data element.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Geography of Accidents</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-house/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-house/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I wanted to find data on where accidents occurred that were covered by the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. To do this, I started with the Xpath query &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(., &amp;quot;ACCIDENT&amp;quot;)]//placeName&lt;/code&gt; to find articles containing the word accident and a place name tag. This produced 279 results. To see which of these were classified as international, I used the query &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=wire][contains(., &amp;quot;ACCIDENT&amp;quot;)]//placeName&lt;/code&gt; to search only in the Wire/Telegram section. This produced only 51 results, which were interestingly entirely in Europe and North America, with the one exception of a story from Jaffa, in Israel. This tells me that the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; reported on telegrams exclusively from the western world, most likely because the telegram system did not yet reach the rest of the world. I knew that people don’t always use the place name tag, so I was missing some relevant articles. To help find some of these, I used regular expressions and searched for “accident at \w+”, which produced 10 additional results. I then used this data to create a simple bar graph in Tableau, showing the frequency of the occurrence of each location in reference to accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/AnalysisBarGraph_jpg/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to produce a geographical display of the data, so I used google maps to produce a simple map with pins in each location that occurred. The first layer, with blue pins, is the data from my initial broad search, and the second layer, with yellow pins, is the data I got from the Wire/Telegram section. This shows the spread of where the accidents occurred, but does not show the frequency of occurrence in each location, which is why I included the bar graph as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1bWVVl9paj6791gmBySRKapJ_dzBbntuP&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data reveals that the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; covered accidents that happened all over the world, but naturally the highest occurrences were in places in Egypt, especially in the Nile River Delta. You can also tell that Cairo is the largest and most industrialized city in Egypt, because it is mentioned in reference to accidents almost twice as many times as Alexandria, the city that the paper was in. This means that significantly more accidents occured in Cairo, because an accident would not have to be as noteworthy to be covered by the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; if it occurred in Alexandria than if it occurred in Cairo, and yet Cairo still has almost twice as many occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a global scale, you can tell that there is an important British presence in Egypt, because many cities in England are mentioned, especially London (which makes sense) and Liverpool. This tells me people in Alexandria care about accidents that occur in England because they are from there and/or have investment/business ties there. Interestingly, nowhere in South America or Australia was mentioned in reference to accidents, which could suggest that people in Alexandria do not place as much value in the news about these places, or perhaps that accidents that are considered newsworthy are less likely to occur there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map also shows that newsworthy accidents occurred in all parts of the mediterranean, and this indicates that people in Alexandria wanted to be informed about Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East because all of these places were geographically close and therefore relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her article &lt;em&gt;Alexandria, 1898: Nodes, Networks,and Scales in Nineteenth-Century Egypt and the Mediterranean&lt;/em&gt;, Lucia Carminati writes “The idea of this body of water itself is thus put to test: instead of a physical or methodological barrier, we must understand it as a space that enabled connectivity&amp;hellip; Scholars have been challenging the idea that a stark border divided Europe and the Middle East up until modernity.” This data supports this idea that the Middle East and Europe are deeply entwined, despite the  “East vs. West” mindset held by many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British held some form of control in many parts of the world at this time, and yet this is not really displayed by the data. There are a few references to accidents in India, which was a british colony, but there is no coverage relating to accidents in Canada or Australia, which were under British dominion. The large cluster of British colonies in Africa to the south of Egypt are notably absent as well. This suggests that people in Alexandria did not place value in news from other countries under British control, which suggests that the British Empire at the time was not entirely cohesive. Britain was like the hub of a wheel, and all of the colonies were more like spokes, attached to the hub but not to each other. This could be a factor that led to the rapid decline of British Imperialism over the course of the 20th century. In Lord Cromer&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ancient and Modern Imperialism&lt;/em&gt;, he writes “The great Imperial problem of the future is to what extent 350 million British subjects who are alien to us in race, religion, language, manners and customs are to govern themselves, or be governed by us.” He suggests that the problem with modern European Imperialism was that they had failed to assimilate the conquered people. This data supports that idea, because it suggests that people in Alexandria did not care significantly more about news of accidents in other countries under British control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1905 was a watershed year in the period preceding WWI. Tensions ran high as Russia was in the process of earning the distinct honor of being the first European nation to lose a war to a non-Western power (Japan), and the great powers were concerned if this, and the nascent but ultimately futile 1905 revolution, meant the decline of Russia as a major imperial power, which would certainly throw the delicate balance of alliances into chaos. But more sensationally, and closer to home, the German Kaiser Wilhelm II openly challenged French claims to incorporate Morocco into their sphere of influence, encouraging the Sultan Abdelaziz to convene an international conference to decide the fate of the kingdom. This is the age of sensationalist press too, where newspapers did not just report news, but had the power to make it as well. Journals mattered, and were a vital means of measuring (or controlling) public opinion, an invaluable tool for historians. Precisely when newspapers are at their yellow-journalistic, propagandic worse is when they hold the most value. The decisions of what stories to run, and how they are written reveal quite a lot about the mindset, values, and beliefs of not just the publishers, but their readership as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the main English newspaper in colonial Egypt, the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; should roughly represent the overall average of British views, but what surprised me the most working on my week was the sheer variety of opinions, and none felt so jarringly dissimilar as those concerning Germany. With this project, I sought to find out whether there was a discernable pattern in when the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; published editorial articles critical or supportive of Germany, and for the most part it seems there is none, and changes in the frequency follow events in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology-and-structure&#34;&gt;Methodology and Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investigation sought to do two things; quantify a subjective piece of data (occurrence of a pro- or anti- Germany article), collect the data, and observe whether any patterns emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest potential fault of this investigation comes from the very beginning: how to measure what is an article’s stance on Germany? From the start I wanted to look at one thing in particular, not wires/telegrams, but articles. These were difficult to isolate because in the newspaper itself there is little regularity in which these appear and how they are presented, which means that in the encoded library it becomes that much more difficult to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I used the following xpath queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=”article”]//p[contains(.,”Germany”)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div[@type=”item”]//p[contains(.,”Germany”)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a “needle in a haystack” approach. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;code&gt;@element=&amp;quot;wire&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; because that would have only brought up results such as news telegrams, which do not contain the expression of opinion I was looking for. Nor am I sure would more specific queries have gotten me better results, because as mentioned above, what I am looking for is not always classified in the same way, and its page location can vary wildly (especially in 8 page issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through these results (which contained many lines from standardized ads or referencing ship arrivals), and read the articles to determine its position. This is unfortunately the most subjective part of the process and thus the one most open to error. I classified any opinion article as pro- or anti- based on two factors. One was whether the article (and being published by the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; arguable the newspaper itself) considered the government or state of Germany as a threat either to the perspective of the writer of the article or as threatening to a third party (and not always a military threat, and it was rarely such an outright sentiment of fear or anger), and whether the article held sympathy for or encouraged the success of the German government or state. Both of these are because what would often happen is that the article would extol the virtues of the “German” while decrying his government, most often in the context of the supposed “failure” of the German state to maintain her colonial empire up to “correct” standards. Germans would be portrayed as successful despite coming from Germany, rather than because of it, which I took as a solid indicator of anti-German sentiment. But again, this is the most subjective part of the process, and I could not succeed in standardizing these criteria any deeper than that. It became a question of “you know it when you see it.” In any case, once I identified an article, I would go into the div header and add the phrase &lt;code&gt;ana=”#german-positive”&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ana=”#german-negative”&lt;/code&gt;. I then ran the queries again to limit the results of the searches to just the articles I intended to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept my data confined to the year 1905 to limit the number of results. That year alone provided me with almost 100 articles. An interesting further avenue of research is if we can see a gradual change in opinion over the course of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I collected the results of these two xpath queries I copy/pasted them into Atom, and by using regular expressions cleaned up the data until each point was just two variables: date, and either positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then went into tableau, and organized the data into two charts, each measuring the results over the course of 1905 by quarter and month. One shows the comparison between positive and negative articles by type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DanielArenasChartComparisonByType/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other measures the frequency of each type of article in a much clearer way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DanielArenasChartComparisonByFrequency/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this data show us? Ultimately, not much. The only patterns that can be discerned is that articles of both types spike randomly, following events, not pre-determined patterns as was previously thought, and that consistently the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; agreed with Grey’s Foreign Office in considering Germany (usually in conjunction with the Ottoman Empire) as a threat to British interests. It must be noted however, that there is also a consistent publication of pro-German articles, showing that while the imperial agents in Alexandria more or less “toed the line” with the government, this was not universal. Even though a good deal of these pro articles came from German newspapers (as opposed to English or other continental ones for the anti side), their universal publication in English rather than the alternative French which likely would have been more popularly spoken among the other European citizens in Alexandria, could suggest that there was a minority among the British imperial agents in support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there may not be much to show for it, I do believe this question of the representation of Germany in colonial newspapers is intriguing, and well worth further exploration. The two biggest problems facing such future work are the lack of a standardized way to define an article’s position, and with the paper itself: its lack of regularity with these opinion based articles that do not come from Reuter’s or Havas means that they are more difficult to search for in xpath, as they will be encoded in many different ways in the collection itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Golf in Egypt in the early 20th century</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Golf in today’s day in age has come a long way since it was invented in the 19th century. The technology, how it is played, taught and how it is treated at country clubs. There were country clubs that had golf courses in the beginning of the 20th century around the word but the clubs didn’t usually revolve around the golf courses rather than the typical “sporting” club games such as croquet and other games played on nice grass surfaces. Golf has come a long way but it still was more popular in Egypt than most would assume in the beginning of the 20th century. The picture below was one of the first images that showed the initial relevance to golf in Egypt, it was taken at the Mena Club in Egypt and adds a bit of relevance to when golf started up in Egypt when this picture was posted in a golf magazine in 1898.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf was invented in the UK in the 19th century and didn’t really become a popular sport around the globe til the 20th century. The English and the Scottish were the innovators of golf around the world because nobody knew about it until they began to share it with other countries, according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.antiquegolfscotland.com/history.php3?itemid=77&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Places-Golf in Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. In Egypt in 1905, there were country clubs that had golf courses but most of the clubs where golf was popular there seemed to be a large influence of it from English members. For example, in March of 1905 the Suez Golf Club registered a tournament for the members to play in and over half of the contestants were English which shows much influence from them. However, as years went on, golf seemed to become more popular to the Egyptians most likely because of the English and Scottish influence that was relevant in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf tournaments in Egypt in 1905-1907 were much different than they are today around the world. After searching &amp;ldquo;golf tournaments&amp;rdquo; in the sport and play section in xml I found results from a couple tournaments and the formats of the tournaments were different from most of the tournaments in today&amp;rsquo;s day in age. This is most likely because of how golf was still a new game and people were still trying to learn how the game was played. The format of most of the tournaments I have read about in the beginning of the 20th century were different from what they are played around the world today. They were played in a “match-play” format rather than a “stroke-play” format like in today’s society. The format of match play is played on a hole by hole basis and is played in a “one vs. one” format. One person plays another and the score from each hole can result in 3 different outcomes; a win, loss or tie. Each hole is worth one essentially in the match and whoever has won the most holes after the conclusion of 18 holes has won the match. Stroke play in today’s day in age is much different because it is based upon a player’s total score over the course of 18 holes and is not played in “one vs one” format rather than a full field of however many players play and whoever has the lowest total score is the champion. Tournaments were played like this most likely because it is more enjoyable and an easier way to keep score against your opponents; it also makes the round of golf take a shorter amount of time and is a much easier way to play for those who aren’t as skilled as golfers are today. After analyzing much of the country club tournaments they are all played in a handicap format as well which is a way a less-skilled golfer can play a better player in a fair format. Handicap is based upon your average score from previous rounds and for those that are less skilled playing a higher skilled player gives them a “handicap” so they can compete fairly. Once again, this makes it more enjoyable for golfers of all skill levels to have a competitive match against anybody. The Suez Golf Club had two tournaments every month for their members; a bogey play tournament and a match play tournament. I configured this information from xml by searching for &amp;ldquo;golf clubs&amp;rdquo; in divisions and finding a sport and play section talking about the Suez Golf Club on October 18, 1905. A bogey play tournament is a format that is not common whatsoever now but was probably a more enjoyable way for those of less-skill level to enjoy competition. The tournaments in Egypt in the beginning of the 20th century were all ran by country and sporting clubs and took time to play. Since match play tournaments are played “one vs one” there were more rounds of golf to be played and this was in the form of a bracket. Therefore, these tournaments would take weeks to complete and those who lost a match would be immediately disqualified from the tournament because they would be knocked out of the bracket. Tournaments now are ran by organizations are much more competitive than they were over 100 years ago mainly because of the popularity of the sport. There was a tournament at Alexandria Sporting Club that included 3 different formats: match play, foursomes and stroke play. The championship format was match play in which M. Logan won 3 up with 2 holes to play. M. Logan also competed in the foursome format which is a 2 vs 2 format and won that to add another tournament title to his record. This information was found by searching &amp;ldquo;golf tournaments in Egypt&amp;rdquo; and was found on the date of February 14, 1906 in xml. The results are posted below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading about the organization of the golf clubs, all members who wish to play in tournaments and register their handicaps are to report to a golf steward of each club. The golf steward is one who runs all the tournaments and puts them together. The steward is similar to what the Head Golf professional of each country club today does; they essentially run all of the golf operations and put everything together for the members. The golf steward of some clubs such as the Suez golf club would give lessons just as a professional at a club now a days does. This aspect of the organization of golf at clubs is more similar than I first suspected. The official definition of a steward is “an official appointed to supervise arrangements or keep order at a large public event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 26, 1905, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; posted an article labeled “Vardon on Golf”. Harry Vardon was one of the most accomplished golfers in the world at the time and in the article Vardon talks about tips of how to play the game and what accounts to the success of very good golfers. This article being published shows that golf was becoming more popular since there was a very long and detailed article on the front page of Egypt’s most popular newspaper. The article also mentions results from the Open Championship which is golf’s most historic golf tournament. Harry Vardon was English and this article transpires back to the fact of how the English made golf in Egypt a relevant and popular sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for tournament results in years 1905-1907 I only came across of 3 golf tournaments which showed that official tournaments weren’t very popular but also meant that they were significant. Three different clubs held golf tournaments and each tournament had a different outcome. The winner of each tournament did not win by very much meaning there was stiff competition but the winner at Suez Golf Club won by the largest amount which can be inferred that he was probably the best golfer of the three winners and out of all the tournaments. There was just a punctuation for his first name but his name was N. Worthy and he won by the most holes. This is significant because it showed who was the best golfer at the time in Egypt who played in these tournaments. The results are in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there weren’t an overwhelming amount of clubs in Egypt in the early 20th century, I figured it would be important to display which clubs there were and what each club had to offer besides golf courses. Country clubs now a days usually have a lot more activities than just golf and so did they back in the 20th century, they often had many games played on manicured grass surfaces. The main sports and activities that the clubs had to offer included golf as the main sport, horse racing, tennis, bowling, croquet and soccer. There were a total of 6 popular country clubs in Egypt at this time and also a few sporting clubs. Every country club had a golf course which shows that golf was a up and coming sport throughout Egypt. However, some clubs didn’t have the stereotypical 18 hole golf courses. Some had 12 hole and 9 hole courses which shows that golf wasn’t the most popular sport at the club but they still had it because it was an up-and coming sport. Croquet was the 2nd most popular activity at the clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;FullSizeRender2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Country Club Sports&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf has shown to be an up and coming sport in the early 20th century in Egypt and provided more influence in the sports world than most people would think. However, it is still very different than what it is today. Almost every aspect of different types of golf and how it&amp;rsquo;s play has evolved which is what sports are supposed to do over time. Golf in Egypt still isn&amp;rsquo;t very popular to this day but it still is relevant thanks to the English and Scottish that brought it over in the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wedding Fashion Trends 1905-1906</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pustam/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pustam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acquiring data for this project was tough. My data was qualitative, not quantitative, so I couldn’t just find charts with what I needed and call it a day. Initially, I wanted to look at fashion trends and how they evolved within the 2 year period. However, as mentioned before, finding the data was difficult. Whenever I looked up ‘fashion’, it would refer me to a hotel ad. Back then, they used different terms to describe fashion. I had to come up with a way to find them. Eventually, I looked up ‘dress’ and found some wedding articles, so I decided to stick with that since the category of wedding dresses would be more consistent and a better way to compare clothing than normal streetwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To collect my data, I looked up the word ‘wedding’ within headlines, took all the articles, and copied and pasted them into a different document. I did the same with ‘marriage’, and within that document, I looked up the words ‘dress’ and ‘gown’. I would read the words around whatever came up, and created a spreadsheet of details I found on the dresses. Then I had to look up the article in the content repository again so I could get the date. I had to do this because simply looking up ‘dress’ would have gotten me a lot of articles I didn’t need, and just copying and pasting the results would only get me the 7 words around it, which was way too little information to work with. I logged in details of who wore the dress, who made it, what color it was, material, trim, bouquets, and more. Then I created a chart with as many of these details as I could find. Some of the data I collected was not reported with the other dresses (like with the creator of the dress, or with the bouquet), so these results could not be graphed. Obviously, this research relies entirely on how the newspaper reporter describes the dresses, the reporter could call something ‘pale blue’, when in reality, it could be ‘periwinkle’, or something like that. Most of the dresses are white, as expected, but some are referred to as ‘cream’, or ‘ivory’. I kept those as different colors because I wanted to see if different shades came into fashion at some point, or maybe there was a significance within the shades depending on class. I thought it was an important difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this project I aim to analyze the trends of Egyptian wedding dresses from 1905-1906 (I could not find any articles in 1907) to see what colors, materials, decorations, etc. get used and what trends get repeated, and if there is any change due to season (I’m thinking specifically with the flowers used). I’m hoping to find things that aren’t typically seen with American wedding dresses, and I want to look at what certain things such as material or color says about a bride. In the article Late-Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Wedding Costumes as Indicators of Social Change by Nancy Micklewright, she describes how certain things about a bride affect what the dress looks like “Her choice would have been determined by her religion, her social status (which in turn involved her family and its financial standing), and her education” (Micklewright 1). If these aspects are mentioned in the article, hopefully there is a correlation between the choice of dress and the features mentioned above. I feel like material will definitely be influenced by social standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a graph of what colors I found to be used and who wears them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/whocoloranddate/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said before, most of the colors were white. Wedding dresses are traditionally white, so this is no surprise. There was not a lot of variation within the bridal dresses in terms of color- ivory, silver, white, and crème. There is not a correlation between dates or seasons for these color variations. Additionally, there does not seem to be a difference in the kinds of people who wore this color (there are no descriptions of what kind of position these couples hold in society… one is married to a well-known contractor and that’s it. There’s a wedding of a princess described, and she wears white).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the graph that depicts the materials used in wedding dresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/materialsdate/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satin was the most frequently used and most consistent material. It appears to be used throughout the two years steadily. One dress uses ‘blonde lace’. This couple got married in London, in the same church that the king and queen of England had attended to view the wedding of Lady Alexandra Acheson’s marriage with the Earl of Derby’s son. The groom was the Captain of the Egyptian Army. Blonde lace appears to signify a very expensive dress. This was a bridesmaids’ dress, and from the article we can see it was very worked up. “charming gowns of white blonde lace on soft white satin, the bottom of the skirts trimmed with Empire wreaths of pink chiffon roses, set in by garlands of blue ribbon… trimmed at the back with little rosettes and short folded ends. A butterfly bow of lace… small green foliage falling at each side. The elbow sleeves were in two, divided by a bracelet of blue ribbon and a single pink rose…”. In 1840, a woman named Angeline Faran wore a dress of blonde lace in Cincinnati, Ohio. She wore this dress 45 days after Queen got married in one similar that brought the style of “simplicity enhanced with lace” (Thieme 2) to the forefront of the fashion world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trend I noticed was the frequency of orange blossoms involved in the wedding dresses, trims, veils, and bouquets. This flower only appears in the dresses made in 1906. The blossoms could be used around the bottom, or as a flower crown/diadem under the veil. I tried to pinpoint it to a specific season, but it seems to just occur throughout all of 1906. I only have dresses from April and September, too, so with more data, maybe this could be evaluated more. I know someone in our class is doing something about flowers, so maybe this project and hers will be able to be connected to offer a more complete explanation for the frequent use of orange blossoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I really wanted to investigate was the origin of these dresses. Only three of the dresses had a labeled identification of how it was made, which was slightly disappointing. If I had gotten more data on where the dresses were created, I think it would have been really cool to map out the origins of the designers and see what cultures influences Egyptian wedding fashion at the time. I know a lot of cultures were involved with Egypt at the time, primarily Britain, so making a map of these origins would have shown how far each influence was. Of the three origins mentioned, two were described to be tailored (one ‘plain tailored’), and they were both going away dresses. These dresses were worn when the bride leaves the reception or after event of the wedding. The only wedding dress was described as being made by “venture of Milan”. This dress belongs to a ‘Miss Nangovich’, and is described in greater detail than the others. Orange blossoms appear not once but three times- on the skirt/train, the bodice, and the veil. Because her dress is described in so much detail, this leads me to believe that she was pretty important. This makes me wonder if the orange blossoms were an indicator of status, but the other dresses were not described in as much detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any topic, digitizing microhistory makes research a lot easier- if one knows how to properly do it. as mentioned before, finding my data was tough and I had to think of different ways across different platforms to collect it. My main issue was the fact that I was searching within a certain type of article (wedding/marriage) that had no consistent way of being labelled, so I had to copy and paste each article that I wanted to search into a different document, and then look for my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This erased the dates of the articles, so I had to go back and find them. This is mostly at the fault of the Egyptian Gazette writers, since weddings were not consistently reported on, not the program itself, but it still would have saved me a lot of time and stress if I had a way to search within. That being said, it was definitely a lot better than having to find the Egyptian gazette scans and go through them one by one to find data on weddings. Digitizing the gazette will help research tremendously, as there is a lot of information in there, and newspapers are the most accurate way to get glimpses into the daily lives of citizens, plus they cover very broad topics. I could have done my project on anything due to how many things are talked about in this gazette. If I had to use another source, such as Google or an academic database, it would have been nearly impossible. Even though there was not a lot of data to work with in the two years, I still feel like I was able to pull out a lot of information to analyze. Without the Digital Egyptian Gazette, I could not have gone as in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temperatures in Assouan and Port Said</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-beasley/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-beasley/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this analysis project I analyzed the temperatures of Port Said and Assouan. Specifically, I gathered information about the maximum temperatures and the minimum temperatures. This data was pulled from the section titled ‘Daily Weather Report’ from within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. The section appears in almost every days’ issue and includes information such as the highs and lows in the shade, the humidity percentages, and the rainfall totals of all the major cities within Egypt during the early twentieth century. With the information on temperatures that was pulled from almost every day from 1905 to 1907 I was able to analyze the trends in seasonal changes. I observed to see if there were days or weeks where temperatures were too high or too low, resulting in the possibility of work being postponed or the possibility of people getting sick. Outside sources and credits made this process more fluid and really assisted in gathering information about safety requirements within a work place and the dangers of being in extreme hot or cold temperatures for set durations of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations of Port Said and Assouan are the key points of focus for my research. Port Said is a city that is in northern Egypt and located on the Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, Assouan is in southern Egypt, near the Nile River, and a part of the Sahara Desert. Both cities have vast differences in their climate and these differences are easily recognizable. For example, Port Said is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea meaning that it gets a sea breeze unlike Assouan. The sea breeze provides outlets for more moisture content to build up in the area, causing the overall weather-like symptoms to be rather humid and seem hotter on some days than it actually is. Unlike Port Said, Assouan is located in the midst of a desert, meaning that the temperatures fluctuate during the day and night. However, the climate of Assouan is notoriously dry and hot. The Nile River does provide some moisture that can increase the humidity, making the temperatures seem like they are hotter than they actually are, and vice-versa with wind coming off the river making temperatures seem cooler and more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another locational difference that stands between the cities of Port Said and Assouan is the Tropic of Cancer. The line serves as a peaking point for the sun during the summer months in the northern hemisphere. On June twenty first of every year the sun appears directly overhead of the Tropic of Cancer marking the initial point and start of summer. The southern most city of the two, Assouan, is directly in the path of the sun during this time. The Tropic of Cancer is located on the latitude 23.5 degrees north, and Assouan is on the latitude 24 degrees north. In addition to being in the path of the Tropic of Cancer line, Assouan is also closer to the equator than Port Said is. When drawing a direct line that connects the two cities the distance between them is four hundred ninety-eight miles, or eight hundred one kilometers. This concludes that Assouan is nearly five hundred miles closer to the equator than Port Said is. For a better grasp of understanding on the distance I’ve included a comparison on distance from two cities in the U.S. From Miami, FL to Charleston, SC it is a direct distance of 485 miles. If you are a native of the Southern region of the United States or have ever travelled to Miami and Charleston during the peak of winter and summer, you know how different these climates and seasonal temperatures are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to differences in climate and seasonal changes, the data that I collected and observed for Assouan and Port Said were fairly different from one another. To show the data that was collected and then evaluated based on several averages I made two graphs. One graph is composed of the average maximum temperature for each month that the data was recorded for, and the other is the same, just with the average minimum temperature. Note that all the temperatures within ‘The Daily Weather Report’ were recorded in Celsius and not Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the graphs, you can see that there are numerous spikes within the data. The spikes occur around the month of July, and the month of January both for the maximum and the minimum temperatures. The maximum temperature spikes for Assouan are around forty to forty-three degrees Celsius. Meaning that the maximum average temperature for the month of July in all three years was 109 degrees Fahrenheit. The minimum temperature spikes for Assouan are around twenty-seven to thirty degrees Celsius. Meaning that the minimum average for the month July was eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit. That is a fluctuation of about thirty degrees per day, which is very common all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum temperatures for Assouan in the month of January averaged at about twenty-three degrees Celsius, or seventy-three degrees Fahrenheit. The minimum temperature for Assouan in the month of January averaged at about eight degrees Celsius, or forty-six degrees Fahrenheit. This once again is about a thirty-degree fluctuation in temperature throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the spikes that occur in the data for Port Said they are around the same times as those of Assouan. This means that the two cities have roughly the same seasonal patterns. However, they are in different climates and that is totally recognizable from the data that was collected. Over the three years that we have data from, the average maximum temperatures for the month of August was around thirty-two degrees Celsius, or eighty-nine degrees Fahrenheit, and the minimum was around 24 degrees Celsius, or seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit. As for the winter months we’ll be looking at the month January. The average maximum temperature over the three years for January was seventeen degrees Celsius, or sixty-two degrees Fahrenheit, and the minimum temperatures were about five degrees Celsius, or forty-one degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this data sums up that the average annual temperature for Assouan is much higher than Port Said. During the beginning of the summer months Assouan is hottest. This is because of the location in comparison to the Tropic of Cancer. During the middle of winter months Port Said is coldest. This also has to do with their location in comparison the Tropic of Cancer, but more so due to the equator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; we can read about the things that people did for enjoyment, work, and many other things. In particular, we are able to analyze that during the summer months people often left Egypt to go elsewhere. When reading the newspaper, a reader can see a plethora of advertisements having to do with ships leaving and/or returning. A huge sum of these ships leaves during the hottest time of year, and it is no coincidence. Work is abandoned in the summer months and people go off for vacation. This isn’t the case in the winter months because the average daily temperatures were extremely comfortable, and barely dipped below forty degrees, and barely peaked any higher than seventy-five degrees. To see why work might have been abandoned during the summer months in Egypt I did some research about the possible side effects of working in extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many plus sides to working year-round, but there are also factors that put people at risk. Working in the extreme heat increases the likelihood of developing heat stress. Heat stress can occur from being out in the heat for too long, working at a high rate, or wearing the wrong type of clothing. The effect of this is the body trying to regulate its temperature and ultimately starting to fail. Resulting in dehydration and nausea. This is a huge reason why work load was put off in Egypt during the summer months, especially in cities that were closer to the Tropic of Cancer, and the equator. In cities like Assouan there are recorded temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees Fahrenheit. These are not suitable working temperatures and working in these environments can lead to exhaustion and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the body’s set point temperature is ninety-eight point six degrees Fahrenheit. Whenever the temperature outside or in the working environment exceeds or goes below this temperature, the body is trying to cool, or obtain heat. In today’s modern time we have technology that allows us to see what the current temperature is at all times. This includes temperatures with or without a heat index to get the ‘feels like’ temperature. However, in early twentieth century Egypt there weren’t weather instruments that were accurate enough to constantly check the weather and its symptoms. All that was given was the daily maximum and minimum in the shade, so there was no way to tell what the ‘feels like’ temperature was. This could’ve resulted in occasions where people suffered heat stroke and other heat related symptoms because they didn’t know what the actual temperature outside was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; will give you abundant information about Alexandria, the neighboring cities, and Egypt all together during the early twentieth century. As an historian, reading the numbers that are provided in the daily weather report mean next to nothing. However, comparing cities within the report with the help of modern information allows for a better understanding of why the Egyptian community did certain things at differing times of the year. Assouan and Port Said are two of the most separated cities in Egypt and give insight on the conditions of life in Egypt during this time from an understanding perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-Semitism in Egypt and Surrounding Countries</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-northcutt/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-northcutt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When first reading the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, one can see how many times death is mentioned.  This can be easily understood; as humans have been interested in death for centuries.  However, I wanted to delve deeper into the kinds of deaths that were mentioned in the newspaper.  Unfortunately, I came across a telegram that talked about a Jewish person’s death because of Anti-Semitic reasons.  Because of this, I was moved to look into the Jewish condition in Egypt, as it is a relevant topic today and it had not been looked into my another classmate.  According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, they believe that “Alexandria in Egypt was the birthplace of anti-Semitism’s ideology. There also the first pogrom in history-as we now would call it-took place” (in 38 C.E.) (Horst). The Center also talks about how the first indication of a negative attitude towards the Jewish people stemmed from the writings of the Egyptian Priest, Manetho.  He writes that “Jews are dangerous and enemies of humankind” (Horst).  But, in an article in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, a writer states that “while the feeling of antagonism towards a race so unlike the rest of the world undoubtedly gained intensity and bitterness from misdirected Christian sentiment and passion, long before the Christian faith had gained ascendancy the streets of cities inhabited by Jews bad been reddened with Jewish blood” (“Egyptian Gazette,” 11/11/1905). Though many of these ideas and allegations happened long before the early twentieth-century, it is easy to see how effects of these beliefs may have still affected Egyptians during this time as well.   Ironically, though, especially before the war, many Jews moved to Egypt to escape the strict regime of the Ottoman Empire, as Egypt was seen as “a safe haven and land of opportunity” (Takla 28). There was an increase in the number of Jewish refugees to Egypt during this time because of the increase in Anti-Semitic ideologies in surrounding countries. Because of this, I would like to see the extent in which Anti-Semitic ideologies are evident in Egypt during this time. Therefore, I will seek to answer the question: what Anti-Semitic ideas or events does the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; include in their newspaper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I conducted several queries of the entire Egyptian Gazette using a series of keywords, including Anti-Semitism, Jews, Jewish, and Anti-Semitic. Though I did specify in my query that I wanted to look in the telegram and local and general section, I realized that, because there were only so many mentions of Anti-Semitism, this specificity was not necessary for every search.  With those searches, I found 18 solid, relevant results, ranging from articles discussing the Jewish condition in Russia to riots in Warsaw and Anti-Jewish attacks. To organize and analyze my data, I collected all the different locations that telegrams came from and categorized these events into instances of deaths, attacks, rallies, and support, to see what is actually happening in Egypt during the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I looked at the places where these mentions are coming from, according to the dateline in the telegrams section. Most of the reports came from St. Petersburg and Warsaw; St. Petersburg was mentioned in the dateline eight times and Warsaw was mentioned six times.  This information did present an interesting perspective on the Russian Revolution of 1905 and how that political freedom sparked Jewish freedom and, consequently, Anti-Semitic beliefs.  Because this is such a major event and Russia’s geographical closeness to Egypt, it is understandable why this information made it into the “Gazette.”  Some researchers also say that the freedom that happened in Russia stirred the Warsaw Jewish population to become more organized and prevalent.  Because of the rapid readjustment of power, objectively it makes sense that it would be met with more resistance that would be documented in the newspaper.  The Russian Revolution’s effect on its neighboring countries is also evident in two of the mentions of Anti-Semitic attacks that happened in Riga, which is part of Latvia, and Homel, which was a part of Belarus.  In both of these places, natives pillaged Jewish shops, and, at Riga, the chief of police was killed.  However, both of these events only had one sentence descriptions, which is very small compared to at other places.  Perhaps it is because these cities are a lot smaller and less politically important than St. Petersburg and Warsaw.  This shows that, though the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is interested in documenting tragic events, they do focus on bigger cities and more well-known places.  Therefore, the data I was able to collect may be skewed compared to the actual number of attacks that occurred. It is also interesting though, that Anti-Semitic events are more widely documented in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; than the Jewish political growth.  Perhaps this has to do with most people’s interest in death and other destructive elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Semitism in Egypt was only mentioned once, on February 10, 1906, at Damanhour.    At Damanhour, a number of Jews were making a pilgrimage to a Rabbi’s tomb where they were attacked by some natives.  The attackers ended up being sentenced to prison for one to eight months.  One thing that strikes me about history, especially as I am learning about history, is the fact that we can never truly know the full information about an event.  For instance, it strikes me as odd that there was only one mention of and Anti-Semitic attack in Egypt when Anti-Semitic ideas were on the rise in almost all neighboring countries.  Is it, in fact, that the attack at Damanhour was the only Jewish attack in Egypt? If not, which I doubt it was, why weren’t other attacks mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;? To what extent does the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; censor its information to better present Egypt’s the newspaper’s reputation? Because I only have access to the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; for micro-historical data, I may not be able to answer these questions; but, they do impact the way I look at the information presented.  To see a complete visualization of the places mentioned, see the map included below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1Q2PeUwRlAoIQAK4IvxpiRyEwF9BcHGZZ&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I categorized my results based on the information; these categories included articles, killings, pillages, and attacks, as this helped me better see the data.  Though the number of times each category of event is mentioned is relatively spread out between all categories, there were more mentions of riots, attacks, and articles.   Though it is unfortunate that there were so many riots and attacks that occurred and were reported, it is also interesting that there were the same amount of articles talking about the Jewish condition as the attacks and riots.  At first, I thought that this might be a good thing, as there is a discussion about the Jewish situation.  However, upon further reading these articles, only two of them actually discuss the details of the Jewish people; the other one is an Anti-Semitic writing about “the Jewish peril” and how they bring poor to the streets of Egypt (Singer, “Egyptian Gazette,” 1/6/1906). Though there may still be more objective discussion about this situation, the underlying Anti-Semitic attitude in Egypt is made clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/CategoriesVisualization/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is also important to note that, even with the updated content of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, there were only eighteen mentions of Anti-Semitic attacks, destructive actions, or articles about the Jewish condition.  Since, as mentioned earlier, there was a huge growth in Jewish political power and Anti-Semitism in Egypt and surrounding countries, it is interesting that this topic did not take up more space in the newspaper over the span of two years.  But, sports events, golf tournaments, art reviews, got mentioned every day.  Though I am still curious about why this is, perhaps it is because, as much as people like to know the dramatic and important events that are happening, they do need a bit of an emotional escape that they can get when they are talking about sports or a show.  I think that that reason is why we have these events in the first place; they distract from everyday life and present a more active and interesting story.  This discovery made me think about the function of the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as well; though it is a way to spread information, it is also about entertainment.  The &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; might have needed a more variety of entertainment to satisfy the readers, which could be one reason why there was such a lack of information about Anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, though, there were several mentions of the Jewish people in the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, so the population is not going unnoticed.  In fact, when I queried the word ‘Jewish,’ there were 219 results.  Though the rest of these results were not directly related to Anti-Semitism, they are still of value in terms of how the Jewish people were receiving representation.  Though I do not have the ability to study how many times the Jewish population was discussed in previous years, I would assume that the representation is rising similarly to that in other, neighboring countries as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, though there is some talk about Jewish people in Egypt and surrounding countries, most of it presents the negative side of the situation, with reporting the number of attacks, riots, destructive actions, and Anti-Semitic writing.  Though the harsh Anti-Semitism that occurred centuries ago is well in the past, it appears that some of those ideologies are not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Children in Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-richardson/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;analysis-topic&#34;&gt;Analysis topic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is filled with information from accidents to steamship schedules. Over the course of this course of this class I have read countless articles on Lord Cromer and the Plague, but there has been little mention of children in Alexandria. With the help of Mr. Hanley I choose to further look into an area of history that this class has not studied. There is little known about children in Alexandria during the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s. A chapter in &amp;ldquo;Childhood in the Late Ottoman Empire and After&amp;rdquo; by Benjamin Fortna gave me the only insight I could find into childhood. He said &amp;ldquo;Girls stayed at home until around the age of five, when they would then begin fetching water and helping their mothers with such work as cooking, cleaning and making fuel cakes. Boys also usually stayed home until the age of five, when they would then begin to take the donkeys to the field or the buffalo to the canal&amp;rdquo; (Fortna). This gave me insight into the expectations of children, but I wanted to know more.Therefore, my analysis question is, how are children described in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;procedure&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finalizing my analysis question, it was important to narrow down what I  was looking for. My first step was to write an Xpath query that would find  how many times child appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I used &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(.,&amp;quot;Child&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt; and found over 18,000 results. I knew this  overwhelming amount of data had to be better classified, so I choose to use  another Xpath Query: &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(.,&amp;quot;child&amp;quot;)]/@feature&lt;/code&gt;. This Xpath looks in  all the div that contain the word child that fall under a feature in the  Gazette. This Xpath had produced 297 results. I than took all 297 results and  placed them into Atom. After cleaning up the results to only have the date and  the feature name, I transferred the results into Tableau to make a graph.  After looking over the results I realized that there were results that included  information that was not about children. I felt it was important to only  include information that related directly to children. This meant that  I had to get rid of results that included last names. Instead of going through  all the results individually using the Xpath from above, I broke the Xpath  down further. I used the find and replace button on Oxygen. I first entered  in the text to find box the word child and the restriction to Xpath was  &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;?&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. The question mark was replaced with any of the words that  feature equalled on the graph. I started with @feature=&amp;ldquo;army&amp;rdquo; and ended with  @feature=&amp;ldquo;wire&amp;rdquo;. This helped me eliminate the results that included last names  and information that did not tell me about children in Alexandria. When I  changed the restriction Xpath I found data that was not included in the original  /@feature div, so I was able to add dates and features that were important for  the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tableau-table&#34;&gt;Tableau Table&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Tableau I organized my results into features vs. years. I choose to get remove the year 1907 because there were little results and most of the results were prepaid advertisements. I made this table to see what feature of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; contained the most articles with children in them. If I could better pinpoint a section of the newspaper I could better collect data that would allow for me to see how children were described in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the graph I found out that the most mentions of child was in the local and general section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Prepaid Advertisements was the second highest, but most of these were advertisements that were repeated throughout the weeks. Advertisements told me about what children could wear and toys they had, but not much information about children themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-and-general&#34;&gt;Local and General&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to look into the findings of child in the local and general section of the newspaper. Overall, the mention of children ranged from a variety of different topics. The most interesting of these findings are: entertainment, child found, hospital, children and accidents and child weddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;entertainment&#34;&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the local and general section children entertainment was a major reoccurrence. The San Stefano Casino hosted the Children&amp;rsquo;s ball. The Children&amp;rsquo;s ball was put on about seven to eight times during 1905-1906. The readings suggested that the ball brought together a large amount of young people. Through the reports made the ball appear elegant, tasty, and enjoyable. contained and The main feature of a ball mentioned on August 19, 1905 was a Massinet pavan, which was danced by children. Children seem to have danced and put on performances a lot for Alexandria events. Alexandria also started hosted matinee&amp;rsquo;s for children in 1906. Along with entertainment for children there were fundraisers that benefited the well-being of children in Alexandria. On February 8, 1905 The Germania lodge was hosting a ball that collected articles of warm clothing for indigent children. Another fundraiser was reported on April 26, 1906 saying the committee of the Rudolph Home wanted to thank the ladies of the Rudolph Guild for their gifts of Children&amp;rsquo;s clothing. I thought it was interesting how throughout the years adults were coming together to give back to children, and take care of children in their city. One man, Idris Bey Ragheb who donated fifty pounds on the occasion of his daughter&amp;rsquo;s marriage which a portion of that money went to education for orphan children. Giving back in Alexandria for the well-being of children seems to be very important, which is still a very relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;child-found&#34;&gt;Child Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising amount of reports in the Local and General section included found   children. Through 1905-1906 six children were found missing. The first report   occurred on July 1st, 1905 when a new born baby was found and brought to the   hospital. All of the children that were found were new born babies that were   left in the streets or in corners of the city. After reading about   all these children, I wonder what was the point of reporting this in the   newspaper? Who would be looking for these found children? New born babies   could not crawl away in the middle of the night, most likely these children   were left there by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hospital&#34;&gt;Hospital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; discussed child mortality rates in hospitals. On May 5, 1906 the Cairo Foundlings Hospital reports that mortality still remains to be very high and &amp;ldquo;Last year, out of 76 children admitted no less than 64 died.&amp;rdquo; This was surprising because on there were no reports of why children went into the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;children-and-accidents&#34;&gt;Children and accidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my results children were involved in accidents 15 times over the course of two years. Two children in Alexandria were burned to death, three children were drowned and one boy died of electrocution. Two children were killed by either a railway tram or tramcar while one boy was thrown out of a train but he survived. One child was kidnapped while another was murdered and one was found buried in a cotton field. One chid got bite by a dog, but survived and one little boy had a wheelbarrow fall on him and left him with internal injuries that killed him.In the Journal article &amp;ldquo;An Anti-Serum for Scorpion Venom&amp;rdquo; Charles Todd talks about the many deaths that occur in Cairo every year due to Scorpion stings. He says &amp;ldquo;These deaths are practically confined to Cairo and Upper Egypt, and are almost entirely among children&amp;rdquo; (Todd). In my findings three children got bit by scorpions and died. Accidents with children can often relate to their deaths. Some of these findings the children died at the scene, but some later died in hospitals. Later in the article by Todd mentions that hospitals in Cairo received the serum for treatments of scorpion stings. Todd reported that &amp;ldquo;Out of 23 cases in the town of Cairo which were treated with serum, only one death occurred. This was in a child two years old who was not seen until two hours after having been stung. The child then received 5 c.c. of serum, but unfortunately this only serum available at the moment was a somewhat weak one, over a year old&amp;rdquo; (Todd). Even children today are prone to death by accidents, children in Egypt are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;child-wedding&#34;&gt;Child Wedding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting story I found in the local and general section was on October 25, 1905. There had been an arranged Muslim marriage of an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. The little bridegroom as they called the boy was taken from his house ad brought to a distant cafe. He was participating in a ceremony called &amp;ldquo;El Huroub.&amp;rdquo; The ceremony entails taking the bridegroom from his home and in his absence the bride was welcomed into the home. The 11 year old boy got tired from the excitement and fell asleep and when they woke him up he fainted. The bride was unamused by the ceremony and the company of her bridegroom&amp;rsquo;s family that she had left and has never been heard from again. This story was so sad because two children getting married so young is a scary thing, but to have her leave him forever is tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have learned from the local and general feature is that children seem to be treated like children. They attend schools mostly based on their religion or family origin. They do what their parents ask of them, like get married. They play with toys and attend balls. They are not immune to the dangers of the world they live in. The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; includes children throughout the newspaper, but overall children still need to be further researched.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Egyptian Export Companies</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-ebert/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-ebert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My analysis project focuses on two companies that ship goods from Egypt to England. They are Carver Bros Company and Behrend Company. I will compare and contrast the goods that each company exports as well as their levels of success. I am analyzing data from the full content available to me from the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, meaning these results range from January 1905 through July 1907. I will also use them to exemplify the Egyptian export industry based off of research I have collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps-taken-towards-completion-and-problems-in-the-way&#34;&gt;Steps Taken Towards Completion and Problems in the Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-query&#34;&gt;1. Query:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While coding the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in XML I found an interest in economic topics, such as imports and exports. I wanted to know what goods were being shipped in and out of Egypt and what countries they were coming from and going to. Therefore, I figured it would be useful to use the data from the &amp;ldquo;Export Manifests&amp;rdquo; section. I tried using the xpath query &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;exportManifests&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; but a very large majority of the results were un-updated templates that had just been copied and pasted. So, with Weber&amp;rsquo;s help, I came up with a new query using regular expressions. In &amp;ldquo;text to find&amp;rdquo; I searched for &lt;code&gt;behrend.+&lt;/code&gt; and then restricted it to &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;exportManifests&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. I did the same for Carver Bros. This gave me a unique set of results for each company that I could work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-results&#34;&gt;2. Results:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I experienced the most difficulty. After copying and pasting the query results into Atom and cleaning it up using regular expressions I could not get my results to paste into Tableau for some reason. One of the companies worked fine, but the other would only paste as a single column instead of separating the data into a table. After some trial and error, Dr. Hanley was able to help produce results that could be transferred to Excel and then to Tableau.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing research on scholarly articles having to do with Egyptian exports, I tried to find any additional information on these two companies within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I did a query for &amp;ldquo;behrend&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;carver bros&amp;rdquo; in &lt;code&gt;//div[n=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; but none of the results were very fruitful. The only results for &amp;ldquo;behrend&amp;rdquo; had to do with a rice mill owned by someone of the same name. Perhaps it is the same person, or maybe a relative. For &amp;ldquo;carver bros&amp;rdquo; the query returned results with information about the office of Carver Bros being a meeting place for the &amp;lsquo;British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt.&amp;rsquo; It was also referred to as &amp;ldquo;a great cotton house.&amp;rdquo; Based off this limited information, I would hypothesize that Carver Bros was a larger and more successful company than Behrend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based off of my results and my visualization, I can see that Behrend company exported fourteen products, while Carver Bros only exported eleven. If one were to simply look at the visualizations, one could make the assumption that the total amount of exports is about the same, since majority of the exports for both companies fall between zero and ten thousand units. However, concluding this would be innacurate because the unit type for each product is different. For example, cotton is sold in &amp;ldquo;bales&amp;rdquo; but cotton seed is sold in &amp;ldquo;tons.&amp;rdquo; Other things, such as onions and sugar, are sold in &amp;ldquo;bags.&amp;rdquo; Since it is unknown what constitutes a &amp;ldquo;bale&amp;rdquo; of Cotton or a &amp;ldquo;bag&amp;rdquo; of sugar, it makes comparing products difficult. Due to Behrend Company exporting an immense amount of beans, it caused outliers on the graph. I still want to include the data for beans since it is one of the products that both companies exported, so instead of excluding the outlier I changed the y-axis of the Behrend graph to a logarithmic format to make the graph more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing specific products, I will focus only on those that are shared between the two companies. These include cotton, cotton seed, beans, oil cake, and onions. Most of these products are shipped several times per year, however I find it fascinating that the Behrend company only shipped beans one time throughout the whole span of January 1905 to July 1907. Not only were beans exported only once, but it was the biggest shipment from the Behrend company in that entire two and a half year span. This makes me wonder if beans could only be harvested and shipped one month out of the year (April, in this case) or if London had another, more valuable, source of bean imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to tell by looking at the visualizations that Carver Bros is largely a cotton company, with its main two exports being cotton and cotton seed. Although it out-exported Behrend in cotton itself, Behrend actually exported much more cotton seed than Carver Bros.  Carver Bros also only sold 384 units of onions and 126 units of oil cake, compared to Behrend&amp;rsquo;s 19,997 units of onions and 996 units of oil cake. Based on looking at these visualizations and analyzing the data   one could conclude that Behrend was a much more diverse and probably more successful company. Behrend not only exported more total products, but also exported more different types of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do these two companies exemplify the bigger picture of the economic world in the early twentieth century? In &amp;ldquo;Europe and the Maritime World&amp;rdquo; author Michael B. Miller notes that the first half of the twentieth century&amp;rsquo;s global economy was largely shaped by &amp;ldquo;the conquered territories of Africa and Asia&amp;rdquo; that had been colonized in the nineteenth century. He says that even though most trade was still conducted between the major western powers, &amp;ldquo;commerce with formal or informal empire accounted for a very considerable share of the &amp;lsquo;global&amp;rsquo; in global exchange&amp;rdquo; (Miller 2012). Both Behrend and Carver Bros were companies that shipped out of Egypt, which was a colonial territory of Britain at the time. From a micro-historical perspective, these companies seem very large and important, however Miller also notes that London was the top European port until about the 1950s. Both of these companies shipped to London, but they were just two of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Agrarian Change and Industrialization in Egypt,1800-1950&amp;rdquo; author Peter H. Bent leads the reader to believe that the early twentieth century was a time of economic prosper for Egyptian exports. He claims that the nineteenth century was characterized by the harsh rule and failed industrialization attempts by Muhammad Ali and that Egyptian industrialization was not successful until British rule in the early twentieth century. However, he states that Britain only facilitated industrialization in Egypt for certain purposes, specifically cotton production. In addition, he adds that Egyptian exports were largely affected by the Great Depression, so based off this research I would assume Behrend and Carver Bros, among other Egyptian export companies, were at their height during the first decade or so of the twentieth century, which is the period of micro-history that we have been studying this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fires</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-meyer/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-meyer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Egypt being located along the Mediterranean Coast, most of their months in the summer is hot and dry in the majority of the country, and humid in the Delta. When temperatures become so high, it can be extremely easy to ignite or cause a fire by heat from the sun. The topic that I am going to analyze for this paper is the fires that appear in Alexandria, Egypt and that are accounted for and the amount of fatalities marked in each. This topic sparked my attention after hearing about the past several years of the wildfires in California. The week that was given to me was the week of February 11th, 1907. With a fire the rate of survival can decrease, and the costs of damage and replacements can increase. The question of interest is if there is a high number of deaths due to fire, is that the reason there is so many insurance company advertisements within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking through issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I found several features and advertisements about fire. I was interested to see how many fires were accounted for and the amount of fatalities that were acknowledge within each instance. I became interested in the trends that may also carry over to insurance companies of the Alexandria and Cairo area seeing if the reason there is so many is due to the amount of fire that are counted for in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After downloading a copy of the master content from GitHub, the first preliminary query I ran was for any div type item that contained the word fire, which resulted in coming upon several fire incidents, but as well as a variety of insurance companies. Upon first glance, this information would indicate that there were various occasions of fires in the early 1900s, but with additional inquiry, a lot of those instances of the word “fire” were advertisements for insurance companies. These advertisements are still relevant to my project and will come into play in further explanation. I took into account that where most of the fire instances were being reported was in the “Local and General” section of each issue where there was an outbreak of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the primary knowledge of this project being from the repository, I also took it upon myself to research the history of fires in Egypt in the early 1900’s. Much to my dismay, my research came up short when the only incident of fire I came across was in Cairo Egypt much later in the 1950s called the Cairo fire, also known as Black Saturday. Cairo Fire was a series of riots that took place on 26 January 1952, marked by the burning and looting of some 750 buildings. If the riots of Cairo were bad in the 1950’s, there could be a likelihood that they were not as far off in the early 1900’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking through the repository with the keywords “fire” and “death”. which focused on the number of fatalities in reported fires, Each XPath query was searched with an item containing the word “fire”. When first using the term, there were over two hundred results, however upon looking through them it is easy to see they don’t fit the article type I need. Some of these articles simply talk about advertising for insurance companies and the rest would only indicate that a fire occurred, but no other details were given. Getting further into my research I soon realized that these findings weren’t the most helpful, there were not a lot of deaths with each report of a fire. At this point I decided to change my research from the amount of deaths reported in each fire instance to the reason of each fire. After doing this I erased my keyword “death” and just decided to look through the “Local and General” section to see the reports of fire and the origin of each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing with other classmates about their analysis projects, as well as looking on GitHub, a lot of them seemed to have the same problem of having a topic that was so broad, but not knowing how to reduce the results with the proper keywords which is the major problem I ran into. I didn’t know how to reduce the amount of results I was getting back since a majority of them were advertisements without using the word “fire”. So after further discussion, I decided to change where I was looking in the repository. I narrowed it down to only looking in “Local and General” although there were maybe a few reports of fire in “Personal and Social” the majority of the content I was looking for was found in “Local and General”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this graph it shows the percentage of the cause of fires from 1906-1907. With a total of 19 reported fires from 1906-1907, there were 10 that were accidental, 8 that were caused from an explosion, 3 that were caused from a crime, and 3 that were caused from miscellaneous categories. With the section of explosions, the occurrences of fire were either on a boat or from mining. At the time in Egypt, there was a high demand for coal and the use of coal for the steam powered engines on the ships which explains why there were instances of explosions that would turn into a fire in the mines and on the boats. From the graph, you can see that a lot, if not all, of the instances would need to utilize the outside help of insurance companies afterwards to help with damage and repairs, which would explain why a lot of the insurances companies I came across in my issues, as well as other classmates, had fire mentioned in the advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the amount of deaths that were accounted for with each instance of a fire is not significant enough to say the fires are the reason there is so many insurance advertisements in Alexandria, Egypt which is why I changed my research to the cause of each fire. That doesn’t go to say though that the amount of fires reported don’t factor into the amount of insurance advertisements because with each fire comes a large amount of costs and repairs. Although the insurance companies probably do take use in the instances of fire, there are other tragedies that occurred during that time frame in Egypt where insurance companies would need to be utilized.

&lt;p&gt;When looking back on Alexandria, Egypt over one-hundred years ago one would not expect much interest to be taken in the humidity in the day to day lives of the Alexandrians. In reality humidity could have an effect on how these Alexandrians functioned in their daily lives and caused different consequences on the city as a whole. Seemingly small things can be more impactful than as they appear on the surface. In this analysis project research was done to see how these Alexandrians could have been affected by humidity and what other consequences could have resulted due to high levels of humidity. The resource that was used to gather this information was from a microfilm version of The Egyptian Gazette. This was a British run newspaper in Alexandria, Egypt in the early 1900s when Egypt was still under British control. This means that some of the information in the newspaper could be skewed to make the British empire look better, so I chose to go with something that would be unbiased. In the newspaper there is a section called The Daily Weather Report which presents much information about the weather that the Alexandrians experienced on each day. The Daily Weather Report was found a page 2 in many of the editions of the newspaper. This was the main source of information used for the analysis project and the Xpath query I used was able to pull all of the data for humidity for each of these days in order to help further my work on the project. The Xpath query done in Oxygen XML editor was &lt;code&gt;//table[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-ta-dawr01&amp;quot;]/row[6]cell[2]/measure[text()]&lt;/code&gt; and it yielded 149 items which is a sufficient amount of data that could be analyzed and allow me to draw conclusions. Through conversations with class members I was able to find out more interesting facts about humidity. My classmates helped me to become more aware of the health effects of humidity on the human body, so I used their knowledge to investigate on the web. The information found in The Daily Weather Report was useful to Alexandrians in the past, but now it is also useful for todays weather experts in order to compare it to the present to see changes in climate and also to see what kind of health conditions these Alexandrians may have been experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to decide what to write about for the analysis project humidity was something that came to mind for me because it seems very relevant when studying microhistory to study something that many others would consider such a minor detail to observe, but is very interesting and thought provoking to fellow microhistorical researchers. Weather is fascinating to me so I figured it would be best to pick one aspect of weather to focus on in order to keep in tune with microhistory and what it studies. Microhistory studies small and miniscule things in order to bring everything back together and form a big picture about the past that can help gain much more understanding about how the world used to function and how the world has changed since that time. When looking at recorded health records at the time researchers can see at what times sickness was more prominent in Alexandria, Egypt and compare that to the humidity levels at that time of year. With this correlation now known it can be assumed that during the times when people were sick or suffered bad symptoms it could have affected Alexandrians workload. In order to further revise and improve what I have proposed I would have to try and make sure that all of the data inputted was recorded correctly in order to make sure that this information is reliable enough to make assumptions about past times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When beginning my study into the humidity levels in Alexandria, Egypt I wanted to make sure that I would be able to find research on a topic in order to be able to apply what I found. I was able to find much information on medical websites to explain what high and low levels of humidity can do to the human body. Information about past humidity levels in Alexandria is important because it is important to see how the humidity levels have changed overtime in comparison to now because keeping track of climate is vital for future generations to come. The climate regulates how much work can be done and the health of the citizens in a specific area, while also regulating people’s moods and emotions. All of this information correlates together by deciding how productive a society can be at all times. Researchers all over the world try to further improve their knowledge on climate so that they can apply it to the society they are studying. Some of these studies reveal many results since their research may study outliers in the climate that they are studying, while many may not reveal much new information at all since what they are studying is too similar to recognize any drastic change showing results. Whatever the case all of this information can be looked at and stringently analyzed so that it can form a big picture when pulled back in with all other sorts of recorded and known information at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem that may arise when studying these past climates is the technology that was being used to record this data. In the past technology was not as reliable as it is today, and this could mean that what was recorded in the past could have been wrong skewing the results and assumptions of past data on humidity. In order to improve research on this past information studies must be done to see how reliable this past technology was and compare it to what is being used today. It is a requirement to know how accurate this past technology was to ensure what is being researched is good enough to rely on. I’ve also wondered if the everyday Alexandrian understood what humidity levels meant and what effect it could have on their day in the past. If they did not seem to care it would give reason to believe that they may have recorded the humidity data less accurately since they did not really understand its importance at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humidity can have negative effects on human health when its levels rise too high or too low. At high humidity dehydration, fatigue, muscle cramps, heat exhaustion, fainting, and heat stroke can occur, while at low humidity people are more at risk of getting the cold, the flu, and other infections. This is according to UPMC Health Beat and SensorPush. With this information in mind it gives a better understanding of what effects humidity could have on the society. At this time in the past people were not afforded the ability to have fancy medical equipment and more informed doctors. This meant that people were slower to recover from an illness that they may have gotten from humidity levels, and lead to an increased chance of death and a decrease in the amount of work output in the community. When observing a single part of the weather it proves that something that may seem small can create a large and prominent effect on a city as a whole. Through studying this data researchers are better able to come up with ways to combat the harms of humidity on the human body and prepare future generations to stay healthy in order to create a healthy and efficient community. There is still so much that needs to be learned on information that may seem irrelevant, but in reality can play a huge role on peoples’ quality of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various graphs I created using Tableau produced some interesting results that helped to give me a better understanding of the data that I had collected. I preferred the graph that showed the average humidity for each month over the years of 1905-1907. The month that seemed to be the outlier overall was April in the year 1906. The average here was very different from other recorded months of April. I also made a graph of the average of each day over the year and encountered the problem of people not updating their Daily Weather Report section. I discovered this because there were multiple days in a row that had the same repeated value of 76 allowing me to determine that others had not correctly updated there tables to provide accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue I encountered when performing the Xpath query and observing the results was that some people did not fill out the weather table correctly or did not input that information at all. My goal was to find data on humidity between the years 1905-1907, but when performing my query the vast majority of the data came from 1905 some from 1906 and a very miniscule amount from the year 1907. This means that my gathered information may not be as reliable as I would like it to be. From what I observed the majority of the data showed that the humidity levels were consistent between 70-90 percent. This did leave room for plenty of outliers with humidity in the high 90s on some days, while on others there was a definite drop in humidity. This shows how drastically the humidity could differ in the climate in Alexandria, Egypt. To put this information into perspective the ideal home humidity level is between 40 and 60 percent in order to maintain maximum comfort and healthy living conditions. This may differ outside but it still allows people to get a better understanding of what preferred conditions are like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very intriguing to see how using technology now such as Oxygen XML Editor, Tableau, and Atom can take information from the past and create a much greater understanding of previously recorded information. New technology has created a great new platform to present information that in the past would be much more tedious and time consuming. With all of this gathered information researchers alike can present this information to keep societies growing with knowledge and to help improve the health and welfare of future generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact from Climate in Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-squires/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-squires/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The climate in Alexandria, Egypt has always been unconditionally hot.  The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; from the early 1900s provided daily weather reports in  their weekly issues. This newspaper also referenced the many ways the population  escaped from the dreadful summer months. Although Alexandria is still a highly  populated city, the booming city from the early 1900s was filled with many  immigrants. Even though Alexandria is close to the Mediterranean Sea, the  western desert provides much of that dry heat to Alexandria. Many citizens  escaped the heat by going somewhere cool back in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat gave the residents no relief, even at night. Without modern day technology how did the residents survive? We may also ask ourselves now, was the temperature a factor in activities in Egypt? If an average spring day in Alexandria hit a temperature of 29 degrees Celsius (84* Fahrenheit) in the shade, how hot did it actually get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Daily Weather Report&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; highlighted the different observed temperatures and conditions throughout different locations around Egypt. The &lt;em&gt;Daily Weather Report&lt;/em&gt; also recorded the moon phases and other station&amp;rsquo;s conditions. All these values are published in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; once or twice a week. To extract all of Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s temperatures, I searched through working sets and got the query:  //table[@xml:id=&amp;ldquo;AlexandriaWeather&amp;rdquo;]/row[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;Max&amp;rsquo;)]/cell[3]/measure to get 1905 daily max. temperatures from Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s observations.![Max. temperatures from  1905].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did the query &lt;code&gt;//table[@xml:id=&amp;quot;deg-ta-dawr01&amp;quot;]/row[contains(.,&#39;Max&#39;)]/cell[3]/measure/text()&lt;/code&gt; to get the data from 1906 and 1907, since it used a different template.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query helped me draw a relationship between the weather temperatures were livable conditions to survive without the technology we have now. The graph I produced from the query shows recorded temperatures around Alexandria. Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s average temperature mean was 25.81* Celsius or 78.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The coldest temperature is even higher than the average temperature for Earth (57*). These temperatures demonstrate that the climate was much warmer than many other habitable places in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seasons in Egypt are quite minimal. Alexandria is close to the coast so they tend to have a higher humidity than the surrounding desert. Since it is hot all year around, and many people escaped the heat in the summer. Especially the British who were not used to the heat, since the UK has a maritime climate. Winter and summer align with the U.S., since Alexandria is in the northern hemisphere, but Egypt&amp;rsquo;s location is an important part of the heat they receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the abnormally warm temperatures, precipitation is also an important factor for the climate. Alexandria tends to have a higher amount of precipitation than the majority of Egypt, but rain has always been very minimal to around a maximum average of 200 mm a year. Although Alexandria is close to the Mediterranean sea, the water was not sufficient to drink, nor did they have the proper technology to extract the water for drinking. This means they had to transport most of their water from the Nile. Besides water, shelter is also very important for living. Homes and businesses were built from stone and clay which are materials that help keep the area cooler. Since refrigerators and air- conditioning were not yet accessible during this time, citizens probably had a harder time cooling off during the summer months. Hence, why the wealthier population tended to leave during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results I received from my data can be conclusive. The average temperature was 25.81*, while the high and low temperatures were 39* and 10.5*. This means that the temperatures were 102.2* and 50.9* in Fahrenheit, giving the average to be. A few data points were taken out of the graph due to being outliers. The first outlying point was a mistake in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The printed high temperature in the shade displayed on the issue from March 5th 1906, said it was 7.5*. This can only be a mistake considering below it says the low temperature was 11.3*. Therefore the point was taken out. seventy-six other values were also extracted due to the inaccuracy of duplicating the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These temperatures recorded would make it hard to live in especially within the summer months. Without proper electricity and water, Alexandria would be a hard environment to live in. Combining the results of the data with the knowledge of technology and resources, Alexandria was most likely a difficult place to live. The harsh climactic conditions could have contributed to a decline in population after the early 1900s. While many of the people who grew up in Alexandria were used to the climate, Europeans who immigrated there could have had a much harder time adjusting. Although the climate in Alexandria, Egypt was much harder to live in, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it was unlivable for the early 1900s. The high temperatures and lack of rainfall would make it harder for farmers and the rest of the working class but overall the climate could be deemed acceptable, especially for the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jobs in Cheap Prepaid Advertisements</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-brown/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I decided to analyze job advertisements in the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The specific contents of the job advertisements that I analyzed were the languages that employers wanted applicants to know, the expected gender of the applicants, and the adjectives used to describe desired applicants. In addition, I considered the amount of job advertisements that were present in different months during 1905 and 1906 to see if there were any noticeable trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used an excel sheet to organize my data into five categories. I placed job titles in column one, the date of the issue in column two, gender mentioned in the advert in column three, adjectives used in column four, and languages required in column five. Overall, I found 129 instances of job advertisements in the issues I searched. I used the Xpath query &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;prepaidAdvertisements&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to search my content folder. This brought up places where people used this element tag to describe an item or section. From there, I went through the results and put the data I needed from the job advertisements into my excel sheet. The Xpath query I used was very broad, but I had to use it because there was no way to search for specific job advertisements without yet knowing the names of different jobs. The one disadvantage of using this query is that some people might have put the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section in their file without using the element tag. That said, I decided that my results would provide a good representation of job advertisements in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the “Cheap Prepaid Advertisements” section in an issue of the newspaper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first way I chose to visualize my data was with word clouds. One word cloud represents the prevalence of different types of jobs in advertisements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               /post/18-analysis-brown/brown-wordcloud1_hueba1fdea7565464eb794f98b434a34e1_1095861_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-brown/brown-wordcloud1_hueba1fdea7565464eb794f98b434a34e1_1095861_847e464e2615a1f011589af307e83f87.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;545&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top three jobs advertised make up over 50% of the advertisements overall. Looking at the word cloud, the most commonly advertised job was for a clerk. In order to organize my data, I did not separate each different type of clerk into separate categories. Among the advertisements for this type of job, many were for general clerks, while others were for typing clerks and office clerks. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a clerk as someone “whose job is to keep track of records and documents for a business or office.&amp;quot; According to Robert L. Tignor in his book &lt;em&gt;Modernization and British Colonial Rule in Egypt&lt;/em&gt;, clerical positions were normally held by people in the Coptic religious community prior to British colonial rule due to their clerical skills. This was especially true for clerical jobs in the government (Tignor 308). Such jobs became held by a wider variety of people during the period of British colonial rule. This happened because Egypt became more modernized during this time, which called for more advanced skills from those working as clerks (Tignor 308). Most of the job advertisements for clerks expected a wide variety of skills from applicants. Applicants were often expected to speak multiple languages, with some advertisements even expecting them to be fluent in five languages. The languages that seemed to be most important to employers were English and Arabic, with many advertisements mentioning that reading and writing these languages was an indispensable quality for employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second most advertised job category was nurse. Many of the advertisements for nursing jobs mentioned that the position was specifically available to women. The word nurse was used to describe a caretaker for children in many circumstances, which is different from the common use of the word. Something interesting I found was that many families would put out advertisements to find a nurse to take care of their children for the course of a ship voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of jobs were only advertised once or twice. It was very interesting to see what kind of unique jobs there were during the time period. For example, one advertisement was for a position as a draughtsman who would make plans and drawings for the government. Another was for an organist to play at a church event. The frequency of advertisements for some jobs surprised me. I only found one advertisement for a blacksmith position, and I thought that it would be a more common job during the time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the frequency of each type of job advertised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Analysisproject/Sheet5?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked at each job advertisement, I wrote down if it mentioned a specific gender preference for applicants. I found that the majority of advertisements did not specify a gender. The only time women were mentioned in job advertisements was for nursing and child care positions. Men were mentioned for a variety of positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Analysisproject/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a second word cloud to demonstrate adjectives used to describe what type of employee each advert was seeking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;

               /post/18-analysis-brown/brown-wordcloud2_hu8b15630e535d54ddcb1d76875e4eb42e_601483_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-brown/brown-wordcloud2_hu8b15630e535d54ddcb1d76875e4eb42e_601483_692c828d4885a74d7635fe51eb199315.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;527&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many advertisements sought young applicants. The adjective with the most occurrences was experienced. None of the adjectives stood out as unique. The advertisements mostly used generic words such as good, competent, and smart to describe the types of desired applicants. Jobs that involved child care often used the word caring. Education requirements were hardly mentioned in the advertisements. Only a few mentioned seeking well-educated applicants, and none mentioned specific types of education required for employment. The words used in the job advertisements were similar to self-advertisements in the same section, where people seeking employment would state their experience and qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important feature that I analyzed was the languages potential employers wanted applicants to be fluent in. Some postings for seemingly simple jobs stated that they wanted applicants to know three or four languages, which was very surprising to me. Languages mentioned included Italian, German, English, French, and Arabic. Many advertisements mentioned that they wanted an Englishman.  There seemed to be no pattern to which types of jobs required fluency in the most languages. Most advertisements wanted applicants to know one, two, or three languages. Only a few required that they know four or five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Analysisproject/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty more advertisements were found in 1906 issues of the paper than in 1905. June was the month with the most advertisements. Looking at a graph of the amount of advertisements over time, there seems to be no pattern to the amount of advertisements during different times of the year. It is hard to tell whether or not there would be a clear pattern if I was able to use a broader Xpath query to get more results. However, such a query would produce too many results to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letters to the Editor 1906</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-majonica/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-majonica/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon first glance of the Monday issue of my week in “The Egyptian Gazette,” I was intrigued by the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. As a history major, I am constantly learning about different time periods and cultures, while desperately trying to grasp the true interests of the people living in these different time periods and cultures. So, when I saw the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section, I imagined the potential for greater understanding of what people were interested in Egypt during the early 20th century. With that being said, when it came time to analyze an aspect of &amp;ldquo;The Egyptian Gazette,&amp;rdquo; I knew immediately the &amp;lsquo;Letters to the Editor&amp;rsquo; section was what I wished to know more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When beginning my research, I first looked at the ‘Analysis Directory’ on our class website, where I noticed a student in a previous semester had already looked into the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. Since they focused primarily on 1905, I decided that I would look into 1906, and after gathering my data and making my analysis, I would compare our findings to see if public concern had shifted between the two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After constructing my analysis question, I began formulating an XPath query. I looked to my predecessor who relied on the query, &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;][contains(., &#39;LETTERS TO THE EDITOR&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;, and decided to use this as a preliminary search. I also searched //div [contains(., &amp;lsquo;LETTER TO THE EDITOR&amp;rsquo;)] to account for any differences in the way the heading may have varied between issues, as did she. However, I felt that this query was far too basic. Yes, it returned all instances of the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section within “The Egyptian Gazette” but, it did not give me much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to build on this query and tried to pinpoint the titles of each individual letter within the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. In order to do this, I started with the XPath query &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;section&amp;quot;][@feature=&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;]. When encoding the digital Egyptian Gazette, each student should have included the ‘@feature=&amp;ldquo;letters&amp;rdquo;’ for the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. Thus, when querying this, I was able to pinpoint the exact location of the section. Obviously this returned essentially the same results as my initial query, however, I ran it again and I added //head to the end, allowing it to pick up each individual headline within that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had quite a few results after this query, but I felt that I needed to take into consideration students different styles of coding, while keeping in mind that not everyone would make the title of the letter a headline. Therefore, I decided to then query, &lt;code&gt;//div[@type =&amp;quot;section&amp;quot;][@feature=&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;]/div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;]/p[1]&lt;/code&gt;. With this query, I was going into the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section, then into each item within each division and finally looking at the first paragraph in each division. This did not return nearly as many results as the previous query, but it served its purpose by looking for any differences in encoding which may have caused my previous query to miss a title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to procure as many titles as possible I ran my previous query again, but changed the ending to /head[1] to compare these results with my first search of the headlines in the section to again make sure that I did not miss any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I finished gathering my data through these queries, I needed to clean up my results which I did in Atom using regular expressions. Once I had a cleaned up version of my results, I was able to cross-check the dates of the occurrences of ‘Letters to the Editor’ throughout the year of 1906 from my predecessor’s query, with the titles of the letters I had acquired with my own query. These were the number of letters I ended up with in 1906:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DatatVisualizationsIFS/NumberofLetters?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon looking over my data it occurred to me that querying the digital Egyptian Gazette for the authors of the individual letters to the editor may be useful in determining not only who was writing, but why they were writing—i.e. what interests did they have in a particular topic. However, this immediately posed to be an almost insurmountable obstacle due to the varying ways people encoded their individual weeks of the newspaper. When querying the titles, I had a similar experience figuring out where in the code the title could be; but, the title only had a couple possible locations, while the authors had more than I could count. Every time I felt I had figured out the proper query, or queries, there was always another issue I had not accounted for. The name of the author could be located in any paragraph within the section, all depending on how many letters were in that issue and how many paragraphs the student encoding allotted those letters. The more letters there were, the more authors I needed to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I could have gone through every paragraph in the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section picking out each individual author but, I began to think about patterns and the way in which each author signed-off. It usually was some variation of this: yours-comma-space-word-word. Now in a perfect world where people always corrected their OCR down to the comma or the space this pattern, when expressed with regular expressions and an X-Path query like this, &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;section&amp;quot;][@feature=&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;]/div[@type=&amp;quot;item&amp;quot;]/p&lt;/code&gt;, could have potentially returned most of the authors names. Unfortunately, it did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I compiled the names of the authors that I could with various queries, but I only had a limited number or authors. Ultimately I moved forward and began categorizing the headlines into more broad topics, beginning to think about what people were interested in when writing to the editor of “The Egyptian Gazette.” Now once I got to this step, the budding historian within me abandoned looking solely at the titles and authors I had complied, and instead opened almost every issue containing letters in 1906 to see for myself what they consisted of. This took much longer than if I looked a title and arbitrarily decided what the letter meant. I was able to create much more accurate categories by taking the time to do this, while also compiling the names of the authors I couldn’t find through querying. It also allowed me to remove any errors in my data that otherwise I would have missed. I still utilized a query to make this process quicker, querying the issues to bring me directly to the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section with, &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature&amp;quot;letters&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly I realized that there was no simple way of categorizing the letters. As I read over the titles, and later the letters themselves, the complexities of the ‘Letters for the Editor’ section revealed themselves. I ended up with a variety of different categories to label, or describe, what exactly the letters focused on. I initially hoped to simply categorize them under single terms, however, many overlapped. Some for example, were a response to another letter or to something published in an issue of the newspaper, while also focusing heavily on public concerns. Thus, I felt compelled to try and be as specific as possible to avoid misrepresenting the letters contents. So, instead of labeling it only as a response or only as public concern, I decided to label it as &amp;lsquo;response/public concern,&amp;rsquo; to be as accurate as possible. Below I have included a visualization that explores the categories I utilized and their number of occurrences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DatatVisualizationsIFS/NumberofCategories?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my overall results, I have a greater understanding of what the purpose of the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section was. Beyond its use for free discourse, where people could write into the Editor to share an idea or opinion, the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section provided a place for public discussion without actually having to be in public. For instance, ‘XENOS’ wrote to the editor a total of eleven times, beginning and contributing to many debates under this alias. The ‘Financial Advisors Note,’ ‘Purification of Alexandria,’ and ‘Officials and Civilians’ were all topics dissected over multiple issues of the newspaper, with many contributors and opinions shared to a broad audience, many of whom used alias. The fear of judgment over thoughts and opinions was eliminated to some degree by sharing them through the ‘Letters to the Editor’ section. It reminded me of social media in the modern day, giving many the opportunity to speak freely without being criticized face-to-face over their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Letters to the Editor’ section was of interest, as people stood to benefit from being included in this section. There was clearly the possibility for financial gain as seen in the various financial pleas to the public through the section. More importantly however, the section stood as a medium for change. On various occasions, people wrote to the editor in hopes of being published to enact change. For example on May 8th, after a letter on the ‘Cairo Water Supply’ was published the needed increase in water was granted. Further, the writer of &amp;lsquo;Alexandria-Ramleh Railway&amp;rsquo; on August 21st, spoke of the “medium of your valuable paper,” implying that the paper, and particularly this section, allowed for average people to reach a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is important to note that ‘The Egyptian Gazette’ was written for and read by the British inhabitant of Egypt. The topics of the ‘Letters of the Editor’ section are those that were of interest to the British. This was clearly evident in talks about the future for the natives, or the Egyptians, without them being involved in the discussion. Yet, that does not deny that the section meant something for the people who interacted with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, after reviewing my data, I returned to my predecessors work and reviewed their results. Although we had categorized our results differently, it was still possible for me to compare the two. While I looked more at the individual topics more specifically, she focused on a broader representation if interests, dividing her results into national, international and financial. If I too divided my results into those very categories, developing percentages like hers, I feel confidently that we would have similar results. I agree with her conclusion that national affairs, meaning the happenings within Egypt, were of greater importance than both international and financial. It seems that between 1905-1906, little changed in terms of public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving now to scholarship, there has been ample work done on newspapers and how people have interacted with them. Yet, even before I began my search, it occurred to me that the letters supported the argument made by both Hanan Hammad, and Nefertiti Takla in their articles regarding sex work. As the purification of Alexandria debate spanning several issues began, there were multiple references to the concerning work women were partaking in. Their words were selected carefully, however, after reading these articles I was able to understand what the public was actually concerned about when writing to the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, according to “The Content of Political Participation: Letters to the Editor and the People Who Write Them,” the authors, Christopher Cooper, H. Gibbs Knotts, Moshe Haspel, looked at letters to the editor to understand political participation similarly to how I looked at the letters in “The Egyptian Gazette” to understand people’s interest in 1906 Egypt. I found their description of the letters to the editor to be interesting, as they wrote “letters to the editor represent a unique place in the public sphere where a diversity of opinions should be represented.” (131) In my research that is exactly what I found. The ‘Letters to the Editor’ section of the newspaper provided me with a look at diversity in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly however, the letters provide me with the opportunity to research multiple topics at a later date, as any of the categories I designated to the letters in 1906, could be used to build a separate analysis project. It would be interesting to see if the letters actually led to changes within the community favoring any particular opinion and if these changes were reported about later in the newspaper as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my analysis project gave me insight into what people were interested in Egypt in 1906 as I had hoped. I feel I understand the people who wrote these letters more completely, as they were actual people, with actual opinions, thoughts and ideas that they readily shared and spread through the most accessible medium at their disposal. Below are my results, showing the number of occurrences of each category, combined with the date, title and author of each letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/DatatVisualizationsIFS/TitlesofLetters?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There were many topics to chose from pertaining to the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; however, in my analysis project I decided to look at the &amp;ldquo;Local and General&amp;rdquo; section of the newspaper. I was interested in the topics that showed up most in the section and moreover what topics kept getting printed in the issues of the newspaper. I wanted to know throughout the newspaper what topics were, not so much being read more than the other but, reoccurring actions to be talked or read about in Egypt during the time.&lt;/p&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this I decided to create a word cloud to make a visual representation of the headlines of each section of the newspaper. In the word cloud, the headlines that were printed most are the largest in the figure and then following that are the headlines that are posted less which are represented by the smaller words in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this data set I created a query that would find only the headlines in the section of local and general and it would also include the date of the issue posted. I used two queries to do this because the &lt;code&gt;@feature&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@element&lt;/code&gt; tags were implemented and each contained data that I needed to combine to get accurate results. The first query used was as presented &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot;]/div/head&lt;/code&gt;, the second query is different by one word &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot;]/div/head&lt;/code&gt; . The first query search returned 2,497 items while the second query resulted in 308 items. After this I transferred all the results into atom and refined the visual content that the search gave me. At the end I had two columns of data that was the date of the issue and the headline that was posted on that date in the &amp;ldquo;Local and General&amp;rdquo; section of the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-and-outside-sources&#34;&gt;Comparison and Outside Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through other analysis projects from previous students, as well as the discussion of it in class, there was one that stood out to me about the Plague. As I was reading through their project they mention that their search for any &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; in any &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; would contain the word &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo; and it only returned 82 items. This search seems to have returned a small number of instances for the return of the word plague considering one of the more prominent words in my word cloud is the word &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo;. They continue to go on to explain the way the word was used and the context of the word in the multiple occurrence in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in relation to my analysis search I want to reference today&amp;rsquo;s newspapers and/or ways of information in today&amp;rsquo;s society. We hardly get our information from a daily newspaper anymore, we typically get our intel from either social media or from the form of digital news still found on the internet. There is the more common way of reeling in viewers with a headline that is either a hook or a brief excerpt of what the piece entails. This differs from the way the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; displayed its news. The headlines for the news paper in the section are 2 to 3 word headlines that explain the passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest printed headline was the word &amp;ldquo;Canal&amp;rdquo; and the second most printed headline was &amp;ldquo;Suez&amp;rdquo;. There were other headlines printed that were seen quite often throughout consisting of: Alexandria, Plague, Egyptian, Stray Dogs, etc. There were often topics that were repeated in this section of the newspaper and new information was displayed this way in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a clip of the newspaper that I would find the &amp;ldquo;Local and General&amp;rdquo; section in and it is typically found on the third page of the issue. Also, to conclude this analysis project I think that the way I represented this data works much better visually than any bar graph would have been able to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lord Cromer in the &#39;Egyptian Gazette&#39;</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pregasen/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pregasen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my research analysis project, I looked at the number of times Lord Cromer was mentioned throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. I first searched a simple XPath query by searching for the word &amp;ldquo;Cromer&amp;rdquo; with the restriction of &lt;code&gt;//div[not(@feature=“advert”)]&lt;/code&gt; to look throughout all the issues and every div except the divs with the feature of advert. I looked through the entire content repository. I found each issue that Lord Cromer had been mentioned at and put that data into the text editor, Atom. Using regular expression, I cleaned up the data to only list the dates with how many times Lord Cromer was mentioned in each issue. I then plotted the dates into a bar graph as depicted below. The bar graph accounts the dates from January 1905 to May 1907 when Lord Cromer retired and was not mentioned further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Image&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pregasen/pregasen-CromerBarDates_hu421387d09014edc4ce9e37712b355761_193856_8d10aed2a1ac909438f1ef8854fe4d47.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this data I could see that Lord Cromer is mentioned consistently with high points during the months of January 1905, August 1905, January 1906, August 1906, and April 1907. This means that he was mentioned many times during those months and few times in others. Between October 1906 and March 1907 Lord Cromer is not even mentioned at all. Throughout the latter months of his tenure as Consul General, Cromer was mentioned on average more than during the earlier years cataloged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Cromer, born Evelyn Baring, was the first Consul General of Egypt. He was given this position in September of 1883. He kept this position until May 1907 when he retired due to health reasons. He lived the rest of his life in England. During Lord Cromer’s reign over Egypt, he advocated for more British rule over the lands and dismissed the Egyptian demands for independence from Britain. Lord Cromer instituted mass reforms like the Veiled Protectorate “whereby he ruled the rulers of Egypt, with the assistance of a group of English administrators trained in India, who were placed in key positions as advisors to the Egyptian government” (Marsot). Along with governmental reforms, Lord Cromer helped institute public irrigation works and many agricultural feats that helped with the Egyptian economy and grow industrially. In 1907, a new British Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, was elected into office from the House of Commons. Campbell-Bannerman was more lenient to the Egyptians. Lord Cromer was in Britain during the time of October and March, which is why he was not mentioned at all in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, when he found out about Campbell-Bannerman’s plans. Seeing the news and hearing of plans that would be put into place, his retirement seemed to be the best course of action. Lord Cromer’s health had been deteriorating too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closely at the data, I noticed that many of the mentions about Lord Cromer discussed his travel across Europe. Many of the articles in January 1905 that spiked the mentions of Lord Cromer all discussed Lord Cromer’s trip across the Nile. Cromer discussed is thoughts on trade in his speeches during the trip. They discussed the prospect of Lord Cromer’s arrival back in Alexandria being delayed by a few days and social engagements Lord Cromer will come back to attend. In August 1905, an article featured titled “Lord Cromer His Life and Work.” The article discussed Lord Cromer’s personal life such as living in an old-fashioned mid-Victorian house and his professional job in Egypt. He was initially given ten years to deal with Egypt. The article specifically praises Lord Cromer’s work with irrigation that helped increase the population of Egypt. In January 1906, Lord Cromer gave a speech regarding opening a Nile-Red Sea Railway. The article praised for Lord Cromer for being a “master of English prose.” In August 1906, Lord Cromer was heavily mentioned. An article criticized Lord Cromer’s reforms and his past actions in relation to the Egyptians.  In April 1907, Lord Cromer announced his resignation. As a result, he was widely discussed. His career and personal life was analyzed throughout months leading to May when he formally resigned his position. Throughout the other months Lord Cromer was mentioned a couple of times. These mentions often discussed his travel plans, his social engagements, and his actions. The only time when Lord Cromer was not discussed at all was October 1906 to March 1907. Lord Cromer was in England for an extended period of time. His health had been deteriorating and these months lead up to his resignation for health reasons. It could be that Lord Cromer was dealing with his health seriously that caused him to formally resign his position as Consul General. It is interesting that January and August were very highly discussed months for Lord Cromer. There does not seem to be a seasonal correlation between Lord Cromer’s mentions and his actions. August and January seems to be the months when big decisions and roles Lord Cromer had to fulfill had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my research, I noticed that Lord Cromer was often discussed as being the “Honorable Cromer.” He was clearly thought of highly among officials. The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; has written some articles praising his work ethic and ability to lead such a simple life. The newspaper further had called him a great man on multiple occasions in 1905. This is interesting, because Lord Cromer’s favoritism for increased British rule in Egypt was subject to much criticism from Egyptians. Yet, this Egyptian newspaper consistently painted Lord Cromer in respectable and good lights in 1905. The newspaper might have been scared of writing negatively of such an important British official or perhaps paid off by Englishmen. The reason for writing as such is unknown. However, in 1906 Lord Cromer had been criticized at many points. In January 1906, the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; called Lord Cromer snobby and claimed that he has almost ultimate power of Egypt. A few months later the article was followed up upon by discussing Lord Cromer’s possible retirement. It discusses his failure in the Denshwai affair in which some British officials and Egyptians began to fight. Taking another 180-degree turn, Lord Cromer was discussed decently highly from March to May 1907. The newspaper seems to be trying to describe him in a positive light again as his retirement neared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this data was especially helpful in gaining an insight in Lord Cromer’s life and reputation in Egypt, the transcription of the articles might have lost some important data. There were many points where Lord Cromer’s name had not been edited correctly and had been written has “Cromor” or “Cnomer.” This would cause some of the data to be lost in certain days where Lord Cromer should have been recorded by my XPath Query. Sadly, this is harder to search for, because there are many different misspellings. Therefore, the different misspellings could cause skewed data that has not been recorded. This could only be corrected by looking through all the issues and correcting the text that had been transcribed incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marriage, Weddings and Divorce</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-frady/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-frady/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My inspiration for this Analysis project began with my blog post. When looking through my page images for the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I came across something that really peaked my interest, “A Prison Wedding”. This directed my attention towards unions during the times the newspapers were published. I was curious to discover trends in marriage during this time-period to divulge whether prison marriage was a societal norm. It’s not every day in today’s society that I hear of a convict being married in secret to a prison guard’s daughter, and accusingly by the prison guard nonetheless! My goal was first to find who the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was reporting on getting married. I wanted to find whether there were trends in the demographics of those being reported on. To truly give an accurate analyzation of the demographics and marriage during the time, I felt that I must also analyze weddings and divorce. I chose those two words because they closely correlate with marriage and there could be articles discussing marriage that don’t mention the word marriage, and that mention the words wedding or divorce. So, I began by searching for each of those three key words one at a time, marriage, wedding, and divorce. The query I used to search for each word was, &lt;code&gt;//div[contains(.,”keyword)]&lt;/code&gt;. This query gave me results on all dividers that contained the word I entered in the spot “keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the basic query, there were a very high number of mentions for the word marriage (543), less than half of that for the word wedding (184), and the lowest number of mentions for divorce (58). I found that while not many articles that mentioned the word marriage used the word wedding, a large amount of the articles including the word wedding did include the word marriage. Though these two words had correlation, articles mentioning divorce rarely spoke of the words marriage or wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-frady/frady-Chart1_hu67fbaac69e0ed19cafdc18c26b300917_2992409_7a3b8346f38f8aef8a9e125dd8c7dec9.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the large number of mentions, I had to find a way to narrow down my results. The first step I took to narrow down these results and begin to analyze the demographics behind marriage in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, was developing a typology for the articles mentioning my key words. I noticed from skimming through each of my my prior searches that my key words all seemed to appear in the same types of features. These reoccurring features included local, social, wire, notesPortSaid and the khedive. To put in to perspective what types of features my key words were being used in the most, I searched for each feature containing my keywords with the query, &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature= “typefeature”]/div/p[contains(.,’keyword’)]&lt;/code&gt;. This query specified where I wanted to search, in my recurring features, and what I want to search for, my key words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching for marriage in the feature local, the query returned 11 mentions. Topics of the mentions included marriage announcements, the word being used as a reference for time (ex: “On the occasion of the marriage of his daughter”), the kidnapping of a young native girl, an obituary, a man murdering his wife for a second wife, the disappearance of a bride on her wedding day, the proprietor of “Al Moyad’s” marriage, a quote in a book announcement, a cinematograph review that included a marriage, and last but not least  and my personal favorite, 11 moslem women divorcing over their husbands refusing to buy them the expensive cakes they wanted. The results showed that the most popular use of the word marriage in the local feature was for marriage announcements. In the feature social there were 5 mentions of marriage. One of these five mentions were on royalty. Other topics in this feature included marriage arrangements and marriage announcements; marriage arrangements being the most popular topic opposed to marriage announcements being the most popular in the local feature. In the feature wire there were 10 items. Nine of these ten items had to do with royal marriages and one with abolishing the church’s rights to interfere in civil marriages. When using my original query to just search for the key word I also found many results in the features khedive and notesPortSaid. After searching with the query limiting my results to specific features, I came up with no results for the keywords marriage or divorce. I also found many more mentions of my keywords in the features that I’ve discussed than what was returned. For these reasons I am leading to believe that there may be manual error in the labeling of the features. This error could alter the authenticity of my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching for wedding in the feature local the query returned 4 items. These topic items included an obituary for the death of the “Newab Begum of Murshi-dibad”, a band of rouges that assaulted a wedding party, a missing bride, and a woman dying after getting knocked over by a horse at a wedding. In the social feature there was 1 item, the mention of a description for an Arab wedding. The wire feature held 5 items, 4 of which were about a royal wedding, and one that was simply figurative language. There were no results with my feature-specific query that mentioned wedding in the feature khedive though mentions for the keyword did show in my basic containing query. The feature notesPortSaid had 2 mentions, both of a royal wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching for divorce in the feature local the query returned 1 item. The topic for this item was the 11 moslem women divorcing their husbands over the men refusing to buy their wives cakes. This item was also mentioned in the results for the searched key word wedding. There was one mention in the feature wire that simply announced a divorce. The social, khedive, and notesPortSaid features had no mentions of the word divorce when using my specified feature query. Though when using my original query to just search for the key word, I found many results for divorce in the features. Again, leading me to believe there must be an error in the labeling of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing marriage within the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I found that mentions of unions were most prevalent in the Local and General (feature local) than any other feature. Narrowing down my search to specific recurring features containing my keyword helped for me to sift through the content of the mentions. I found that the demographics were more difficult to analyze than what I’d originally thought. The gender of those involved were always a mix of male and female. There were no mentioned unions between genders of the same sex. The race of the individuals involved in marriage were not specified. However, the countries they were affiliated with often were. The mentioned countries were very diverse. The countries with the highest number of mentions include Spain, France, Germany, and Egypt. Other locations with reports on marriage include Arabia, Oneibis, Murshi-dabad, Moslem, Nahier el Lahoon, Sundanese, Ramleh, Sohag, Norway, Battenberg, Oldenburg, and England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the locations of the reports on marriage were so diverse due to a topic discussed with numbers in mentions substantially larger than others. This topic was the royals. Many announcement, arrangements, and weddings were all being reported on royalty. I’ve included a chart below to show how much higher the percentage of mentions for royal marriages there were opposed to other topics of the results I acquired after narrowing my search. Royalty would effect the reports on marriage because they all rule over different countries, diversifying the results. When considering why royalty is more popularly reported, I would argue that it could be due to the Royals’ control over the media. The media was likely pressured to report news of the royals by the royals. Royals also determined the failure and/or successes of their peoples’ countries. For this reason, readers were likely eager to here of the royal political alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Most Popular Sports</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-mason/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose to study the most popular sports in Egypt during the early 1900s for my analysis project. As a Sports Management major, this subject is very interesting to me as I can compare how sports culture has evolved and changed throughout the years. Newspaper sections titled &amp;ldquo;Sport and Play&amp;rdquo; frequently appear throughout the issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, and many popular sports and sports clubs appear throughout the years. To be clear, I can&amp;rsquo;t analyze the most popular sports in all of Egypt because the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is primarily geared towards relatively wealthy British colonists in Egypt during this period. For this reason, I will be studying the most popular sports in Egypt specifically among the wealthy British occupants of early 1900s Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began studying the most popular sports in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; by sampling several months of issues in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and finding the &amp;ldquo;Sport and Play&amp;rdquo; section in each newspaper issue. I was able to narrow down the most frequently mentioned sports in Egypt by doing this. Once I had the list, I created an XPath Query for the different types of sports I had found, and compared the totals. By doing this, I found that horse racing and tennis were by far the most frequently mentioned sports throughout the repository with over 1000 results for each. Billiards and yachting were around 400, while cricket, football (soccer), and golf were just under 300. Other sports with less results included polo, swimming, rifle shooting, and rugby. However, with this method I was only able to survey the number of times these sports were mentioned throughout the entire repository including numerous types of divs. For instance, sports such as tennis, golf, and football might have been featured in more ads than horse racing because people tend to buy sports equipment frequently but they don&amp;rsquo;t buy horses or rifles as frequently. In addition, the results from conducting an XPath on the entire repository were significantly different from those found while just sampling the Sport and Play category, which was originally intended to be the basis for my serial question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my random sample of the Sport and Play categories, the most popular sport by far seemed to be horse racing which was consistent with the larger XPath. Frequently mentioned horse racing clubs included the Helouan Sporting Club and the Khedivial Sporting Club. In the issues that I sampled, horse racing was mentioned in 26 articles. The articles described the results of various horse races, pony races, and donkey races between 1905 and 1907. These articles also described meetings scheduled by the Helouan Sporting Club and the Khedivial Sporting Club, demonstrating that readers of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; were fascinated by horse racing and looked for when the next race would occur so they could find the results. This is likely because most of the readers of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; were English colonists who probably gambled on the races as this was common at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second most frequently discussed sport in the Sport and Play sections between 1905 and 1907, far ahead of the other mentioned sports, was football (soccer). I was originally going to focus on football as the subject of my serial question, but I decided to widen the scope of my search and compare its popularity to the other sports played during this period of Egyptian history. From the issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; that I sampled, football was mentioned 14 times, 12 less than horse racing. It was difficult to determine when some of the articles were talking about rugby football and when they were discussing regular football as &amp;ldquo;football clubs&amp;rdquo; can refer to both. Football/soccer clubs such as the Royal Berks Regiment, the Port Said Football Club, the Suez E.T.C. Club, and several others were mentioned numerous times throughout the sampled issues. Though not as popular as horse racing, football was definitely a prominent sport in Egypt during the early 1900s and has remained and even become more popular across the world since this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at other background sources, I found that football seems to be the current most popular sport in Egypt, especially at the moment due to the fact that Egypt qualified for the 2018 World Cup. This is only the third time Egypt has ever qualified for the world cup and it&amp;rsquo;s also the first time they&amp;rsquo;ve done so in almost 20 years (Sky Sports). Evidently, football is a huge deal in Egypt and it was likely just as popular in the early 1900s. According to Muhammad Y. Gamal, an independent researcher of the &amp;ldquo;Arab world,&amp;rdquo; ancient Egyptians potentially played a sport similar to football. This idea is supported by ancient paintings in Egypt that show people kicking a &amp;ldquo;round object on the ground with their feet.&amp;rdquo; However, the game was never a prominent part of Egyptian society until the occupation of Egypt by the British introduced the game as we know it today. After watching British soldiers and citizens play the game and establish clubs all over the country, Egyptian citizens became interested and began establishing their own clubs as well. This is just one example of the ways English occupants impacted Egyptian society in a process that can be seen throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third most popular sport from my sample seems to be yachting. The Khedivial Yacht Club was the most prominent yachting club in the sampled issues, and there seems to have been a genuine interest in yacht races during this period of Egypt. Due to Egypt&amp;rsquo;s occupation by Great Britain during this period, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume the wealthy British citizens who occupied Egypt during this time were more interested in this sport than the native Egyptians. Articles about the Khedivial Yacht Club either described the results of recent races or the dates of upcoming races so that readers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss out. Yachting was mentioned in 7 different articles throughout my sample, more than any of the other minor sports in Egypt at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3 regularly mentioned sports were different from the larger XPath&amp;rsquo;s results in that tennis was much more frequent throughout the repository than all other sports than horse racing. However, when I searched through the results of the larger XPath, I found that tennis was mentioned in ads most of the time and was occasionally mentioned in the Sport and Play section when tennis tournaments were occurring. The company Davies Bryan &amp;amp; Co. was featured in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; often and consistently mentioned tennis in each of their ads because they supplied athletic goods. Because of this, I believe football was more popular at the time because the readers of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; tended to read the Sport and Play section for horse racing, football, and yachting rather than the ads that featured information about &amp;ldquo;tennis balls&amp;rdquo; being restocked &amp;ldquo;weekly&amp;rdquo;. While billiards was also mentioned more frequently than football, it seems it was most often mentioned in ads for the Eastern Exchange Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the background source &amp;ldquo;topend sports,&amp;rdquo; football, basketball, speed-ball, tennis, and squash are the most popular sports in Egypt today. While basketball, speed-ball, and squash were not mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, the interest in football and tennis seems to have remained prominent for over 100 years in Egypt amongst English occupants and Egyptian citizens. After doing further research, I found that the establishment of football clubs in Egypt by English occupants &amp;ldquo;brought football to the Nile Valley&amp;rdquo; and the same can likely be said for tennis and several other sports (ResearchGate). English culture left a mark on Egypt, and the sports they played that are still played in Egypt today are evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, less popular sports mentioned in the issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; included billiards, golf, tennis, swimming, cricket, rifle shooting, and even camel racing and buffalo racing. Most of these sports are still popular today, many of which are played in the Olympics; however, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe camel and buffalo racing have retained their popularity in the years since. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to state with 100% confidence which of these sports was definitively the most popular sport in Egypt at the time, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that horse racing, football, yachting, and tennis were the most prominent of the wide range of sports that were played in Egypt in the early 1900s. By potentially studying other local newspapers in Egypt and accounts of sports at the time it would be possible to narrow down the results, but by using the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as the only primary source it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find a definite answer. Studying Egyptian newspapers rather than English newspapers like the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; would be an interesting way to compare which sports were more popular with Egyptian citizens compared to those popular with English occupants, but these are all just ideas for further research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polo in Cairo</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-bolger/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-bolger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose to do my Analysis Project on the performances of different polo players and teams in Egypt and using different xpath queries and analysis to see who is the best polo player and the best polo team in Egypt. For this analysis, I will be searching through the editions of the 1905-1907 &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and determine which of the polo players and teams in Egypt have the better performances through those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading through my week of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, which is March 5-10, 1906, I was always interested when it came to putting the ‘Sport and Play’ section together into xml formatting and I ended up reading most of the articles in that section. One of the headlines that would always seem to pop up for my week and interest me was the Cairo Polo Tournament. During the Cairo Polo Tournament and other polo games throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, there are usually two games that are played on a given day and the days of the week that the Cairo Polo Tournament was being played were Monday, March 5th, Wednesday, March 7th, and Friday, March 9th, of 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.britannica.com/sports/polo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Polo&lt;/a&gt; is a game that is played on horseback between two teams, each who use mallets with long, flexible handles to drive a wooden ball down a grass field and between to goal posts. Before reading the articles about the Cairo Polo Tournament, I was uninformed about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/The-Origins-of-Polo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; of polo and how it is played. Now, I am most informed about the sport and can understand terms that are being used in the articles about the games. Polo has aptly been called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25485776.pdf?refreqid=search%3Af56393a29453dff0a4f76b5dc4efb7d2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt; on horseback. Each team usually consists of four polo players in each game and one umpire to regulate play of those games. The games are separated into four chukkers and whichever team scores the most goals at the end of the fourth chukker wins the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.horsetimesegypt.com/pdf/articles/Polo_In_Egypt_Sport_Of_Kings_And_The_Kings_Of_The_Sport.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;historians&lt;/a&gt; of the sport consider that the game was first actively played as a cavalry exercise in Persia as early as the 6th century BC, migrating with conquest both east to China during the Tang Dynasty (7th century AD) and west to Byzantium, arriving in Egypt during the Ayyubid period (12th century AD). When I was reading through these articles, I wanted to know the context of these games, and which of the players and teams were really good and supposed to win and which of the players and teams weren’t as good as the other teams in the tournament. When thinking about what my analysis project should be, I immediately thought about this concept and was intrigued to find out more about the world of polo in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the questions that I had about polo teams and players, I composed and ran an xpath query in our main repository of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; issues that were already put into xml formatting. The xpath query that I ran to execute this task is &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;][contains(., &amp;quot;chukker&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;. I used the word “chukker” as my search word because there are many times where the word “polo” shows up without their being an actual game. Whenever the word “chukker” showed up, there was always a game that was attached to the term. After I ran the xpath query and sorted in the repository to see where the polo games were in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I started to read the articles that consisted of those polo games in Egypt and find out which teams played in each game, how each of the teams performed that game, as well as their players, and who ended up playing the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the polo matches and tournaments were found in the ‘Sport and Play’ section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, which was located on page five most of the time. The search for my query on the word “chukker” came back with 54 results, which was not as much as I thought it would be, but it is still enough to do analysis for this project. Most of the returning results from my query were from the first few months of 1906 and all of those results came from tournaments that were being played. The results of this query can also be hampered because of the fact that there are some issues that have not been turned into the main repository yet, or some students just didn’t correctly format when they were doing their xml coding. I think that if I had every issue from 1905-1907, correctly formatted and turned in to the main repository, I would have a lot more results for my query and more games that I can use for evaluation to see who ends up being the best polo player and team in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through my results, I put together a bar graph showing the number of goals that were scored per game in all of the polo games combined by each of the teams that played, along with players that scored those goals each game. Out of the five teams that played polo in Egypt during this time, the Tourists is the team leading this category, scoring 4 goals per game. The player that had the most goals per game was Captain Stockwell, who averaged 1.5 goals per game. Stockwell plays for the Mosquitoes, who was second in this category with 3.25 goals per game. This gives a visual representation for not only which team scores the most goals per game in all of the polo games, but also which players score those goals each game for their teams and how many goals per game they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although statistics are a big part of the research for my analysis project, it is not the only source that I will be using to determine who is the best polo team and player in Egypt. When I read through the articles that consist of polo games, I will see what the writer specifically says about each of the teams and the players and how they performed from his point of view, since he was there to watch all the games go down in 1906. I took down notes of what the writer said about each player and put those together with the statistics to figure out the best teams and players that play polo in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of my visualizations that I used is that I put together some pie charts with the number of total goals from each of the polo teams, along with their players on that team, and see which of the teams and players scored the majority of the goals in all of the polo games that were played. The Tourists were the team that scored the most goals, with a total of 16 goals, along with Captain Stockwell scoring the most goals from all the players on the polo teams, with a total of six goals. This gives a better representation of who dominates in scoring for all the polo teams and players in Egypt for 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data visualization charts that I used above are different because one shows the goals per game by each player and team, while the other shows the total amount of goals of the same players and teams. I decided to use both of these data charts because for the first one, it shows the players and teams efficiency in each game with the average amount of goals they score, while in the second one, it shows the total goals and who is the best overall scorer on each team and the best scoring polo team in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next data visualization that it shown is a multi-bar chart for the total amount of wins and losses each of the polo teams have throughout the course of all the polo games that are played. This shows, blatantly, which of the teams that have played are really good or really bad. From this chart, you can also examine, from the teams that have good win-loss records, that most of the good players that play polo are from the teams that have winning overall records in the polo games that they play. The Tourists have one of the best records in Egypt from all the polo games, with four total wins and zero total losses. One of the worst teams in polo is E.A., who have a combined zero wins and four losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, through my xpath query results, along with my data visualizations and analysis research through the many polo game articles, I have found that the best polo team in Egypt is the Tourists and the best polo player in Egypt is Captain Stockwell. The Tourists have not lost a game of polo, with an undefeated record of 4-0, and Captain Stockwell, from the Mosquitoes, leads all polo players in goals scored and is thrived upon by the writers when he plays. Other great players that played polo in Egypt are Mr. Paravicini and Mr. Pickering, who both play for the undefeated Tourists and each scored five total goals from their polo games. Even though there wasn’t as much information for analysis as I thought there would be, the information that I gathered for research was still appealing and the game of polo in Egypt is something that the people who loved sports wanted to read in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rainfall</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-degroat/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-degroat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microhistory gives the ability to focus on smaller details in history to be able to fully understand why and what happened during that day in time. Microhistory for this class allowed the students to investigate the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; newspaper from 1905, 1906, and 1907 and see details from our certain weeks assigned to us. The week that was given to me was the week of June 17th, 1907. After analyzing six days of this newspaper, we start to see similarities and patterns in the paper overtime. Each day has around six to eight pages and while each page is different, each page of each day has a similar format with different topics. Page one consisted mainly of ads which were pretty much uniform throughout all of the days for my week. Page two has some adds mixed with some text. The page threes are mostly text. They all start with “Local and General,” then the “Financial Crisis,” and then articles about what is happening at the time. Page four mostly consists of charts full of data, ranging from cotons to stocks and shares. Page five is more information about what was happening in their society at the moment. It has two columns of telegrams, a daily weather report, and usually a story highlighting a specific person. Page six continued with more ads along with ads that would normally go on flyers and some data. The daily weather report on page five is my main focus for this assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After downloading a copy of the master content from GitHub, I used it to isolate the daily weather report from the deliverables. Using the daily weather report I wanted to find out all of the inputted values for the amount of rainfall every month for every year. After retrieving the values, I could not fully complete the graph that I wanted to have consisting of months, years. The reason behind it is because some of the data consisted of “Heavy Dew” for some records rather than a number of how much rain. Because it is a text and not an exact amount, the graph could not show the amount of rain each month for each year. However, I computed a graph that shows and added amount of rainfall for the month. There are some months with no rainfall because it did not rain, and it is recorded that it did not rain that day. The day that it rained the most is undetectable because there are two entries of “Heavy Dew” which could be a larger number, we do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In analyzing how much rainfall there was over time, after looking at the graph, we can conclude that there was only recorded rainfall for fourteen out of the thirty-six months. After going through a majority of the files to be sure that the data for the rainfall daily was correct, I also chose to read the information under the “Remarks” tab regarding the weather for that particular day. Doing this give me a look to be sure that the value entered is correct. I can determine this because if a value is recorded as no rain for that particular day, but the remarks for that day says that there was heavy pour or “dew”, then I know that the data is incorrect. While I did not read through all of them, because there are an awful lot, I read through one every other Monday. I chose to do it like this because it is easier to stick to one certain day to look at rather than switching days and getting mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph above shows the amount of rainfall from 1905 to 1907 each month. The months that have no data are crammed together and not shown because there is no recorded date for those days or months. For the graph, the average rainfall cannot be shown because all of the entered values are not all numbers so the graph can only show the amount of times that it rained every month. After working with Webber in office hours, we came to the conclusion that there was no other possible way to retrieve that data for average rainfall and that the only possible solution was to record the data for how many times it rained per month per year. Using the daily weather report data, not only rainfall for the day is shown. It also consists of direction of wind, maximum temperature, and humidity level for the day, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph displays the amount of rainfall per month in hundredths of a mm. The difference between the two graphs is that this one disregards the values that say &amp;ldquo;Heavy Dew&amp;rdquo; and only focuses on the numerical values that were inputted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that I chose doing a graph using the data of rainfall recorded in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; for all three years is because I favor the rain. There is no special reason that has to do with my major or what I am interested in, it is simply because I enjoy the rain and I was curious to see how often it rained in Egypt during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain a graph of the amount of times it rained per month per year in Egypt, I first had to search in the master content folder on my hard drive. The XPath query that I used to get these results is &lt;code&gt;//cell[contains(.,&amp;quot;Rainfall&amp;quot;)]//following-sibling::cell/measure&lt;/code&gt;. Doing this, I was given back the days and values inputted for rainfall each day in the newspaper. The XPath that I used tells Oxygen XML Editor to first look in the second level of cells that contain “Rainfall” and to then to look into the measure to see what the value is. After 73.3 seconds, the XPath came back successful, returning the inputted values and dates for which it rained daily. The data is formatted that each value is measured in millimeters and every “null” value was recorded as no rainfall for that day. The “Heavy Dew” description imputed for the value of rainfall cannot be considered a number because it is unknown how many millimeters “Heavy Dew” can account for. After getting the information from Oxygen XML, I used Atom to take out the information that I did not need to use and took everything out except the date and amount of rainfall for that day. Then, using Tableau, I uploaded my data into the software and computed a graph of how much is rained every month from 1905 to 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strengths and weaknesses of using the content folder of the information from the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; can cause problems or be extremely helpful. A weakness about using the master content folder to search through and pull information from is that it is information put into the document by persons, so it is not 100% accurate if even one person did it wrong or left out information. A strength of the content information is that all of the information and data is in one large file that can be searched through completely. Another weakness is that not only could the information be wrong, but there could be information left out of the documents. Whomever transferred the information from the newspaper to the content folder could have left out certain numbers, ads, or articles. When it comes to searching for something, if it is left out of the file, then the information is not there to be found. For example, while searching for rainfall for every day, if someone who was entering the information for May 8th forgot to change the value of rainfall from 0 to 2 mm, then my data is inaccurate based on how much it actually rained that day. Therefore, whatever documents are changed by a person need to be trusted that the information updated is correct information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at the project titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/analysis/2017/vaverek-analysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Making Sense of the Daily Weather Report&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; I looked through the picture that they used, and in this certain one, there was no section for rainfall. There are multiple cases where this occurs. Some of the newspaper issues do not have rainfall in the daily weather report. This could be because it did not rain that day. However, there are multiple times that it is labeled in the paper with a value showing that there was no rain for that day. So the question that arises is, why do some days not have the rainfall tab in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an external source, I also looked at the website &lt;a href=&#34;oldweather.org&#34;&gt;oldweather.org&lt;/a&gt; to see if there was any information about rainfall during 1907 and the earliest dates that I could find weather reports on were from 1913 to today. I searched the website for any information regarding 1905, 1906, and 1907 but no information surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reported Accidents, Incidents, Tragedies, and Disasters</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-cannon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-cannon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we think of the day to day lives of people we may think of a consistent schedule that only changes when major events happen.  However, from first hand experience I know the largest disruption to daily life are accidents.  So when looking at the lives of people living halfway across the world over a hundred years ago I wanted to see how they handled these accidents and in what ways they were affected by them.  In this analysis I will be finding the various accidents that made it into the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; between the years of 1905-1906 and will compile the data based on what they were called, what type of accidents were likely to be deemed newsworthy, and to see what sort of long term impact (if any) they might have had on the city of Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I need to do however is to define what I am searching for.  This is where the source came in handy, as even though it was more recent than the time period I will be analyzing it still laid out a format on analyzing accidents.  According to the study, in a group of 500 young Egyptian men around 4.6% of the group experienced an accident within sometime in their lives.  This is helpful in analyzing what types of accidents were most likely to make the headlines as well since the study was also able to gather the percentage of people who experienced various accidents such as motor or fights or even an electrical problem.  When I say the word accident, I will be referring to both accident and any other word that was used to describe such an event.  Another term I looked for when studying accidents was the word “incident,” which it turned out gave a lot of results but not the same kind of news.  While articles with the title accident they focused on an event that was caused by something random or unexpected whereas incidents seemed to be used more for intentional conflicts such as on the frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking all the times that the word accident was used in just the headline for an article I was able to gather 103 results.  Many of these headlines were duplicates in the Local and General section such as “Terrible Accident” or “Motor Accident.”  I thus divided these titles by certain features with accidents related to vehicles categorized under &amp;ldquo;vehicles&amp;rdquo; and more general headlines like &amp;ldquo;tragic accident&amp;rdquo; under the &amp;ldquo;general section (please see the graph for Accident Reappearance for a visualization). The most interesting ones were ones that had a specific title next to them, such as those that mention the specific individual by name such as an article from the June 12th, 1905 that had the headline “Mr. Clowes in a Railway Accident” or the “Kafr Zayat Railway Accident” on June 23, 1905.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the year 1905, the month of June saw a large spike in railway accidents with headlines such as the two I mentioned in the previous paragraph as well as those with the title “Cairo Express Derailed” and “Another Railway Accident.”  This indicates a massive problem with the Egyptian rail system if it was a frequent enough disaster to be a cause for discussion repeatedly in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.  Another accident that got multiple articles was when the King of England ending up tearing a tendon in his leg.  According to the articles (one was published on the 17th of November and another on the 18th in the year 1905) King Edward VII had ended up tearing a tendon above his ankle.  The articles focused on separate issues, with the preliminary one giving the details about where the King had his accident, what he was doing, and tried to downplay what exactly happened to him while the follow-up that was issued the following day gave the specific details such as where the injury was, who was surrounding and greeting the King during his rough time, and what he plans to do since he was issued to be in no danger anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two articles help illustrate who was reading the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, cause while the railway accidents and other disasters that frequently made the news were never issued a follow-up (including one of the specific headlines that had a government agent named) the only one to receive one was based on a foreign king.  This points the disparity between using the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; as a source for the common Alexandrian people as this paper was written for an international audience in mind and focused on English events whenever they had any impact on its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another term I was expecting to yield results was any headline pertaining to tragedy, however to my surprise I was only able to pull up 17 headlines containing the word.  The title seemed to indicate that when it was used it was during an act that was either indefensible or an incident that had personal information on the victims.  One such example was on January 4, 1905 when two men were killed by a third when they all wished to marry the sister to one of the victims.  This seems to indicate that the news did not try to stir emotions as tragedy is usually implied to an act that was meant to stir up emotions.  Even when I tried to broaden the search by then going to tragic it came up with even less results with a measly 4.  Most of these events could not even be labeled as accidents as the previous article I highlighted and another titled “M. Cronier’s Tragic Suicide” were intentional and thus do not fit into the scope of the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last term I decided to hunt for in my topic was the term “disaster.”  This also pulled a surprisingly low number of results with just 16 in the headline.  These events seem to correlate to stories that have no good things about them, such as one from the July 10th edition from 1905 that had a headline for “French Submarine Disaster: Crew Reported Dead” when a submarine was almost saved by a crane only to be dropped back after fresh air was brought in to prolong their suffering.  Most of these headlines also seem to happen to either international areas or to ship accidents with three headlines for Submarine disasters being the most used stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other term that pulled popular reports was the term incidents, that came up with 43 headlines.  Most of these incidents as I mentioned before were based more on international incidents such as frontier skirmishes that happened in areas such as Morocco and the North Sea or happened in international waters such as the “Andromeda Incident” that happened on the 10th of January in 1905.  This language indicates how the term accidents and incidents were used, as while they could be mean events that were caused by something tragic or unintentional they were events that involved only one party and an event that happened on an international level respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these results were gathered by using Xpath’s results features using the find and replace function.  This turned out to be a great way to find what I was looking for, as since my topic was dealing mostly with headlines and the diction that was used in it.  It also helped that the Xpath queries had specifications that I could use.  These involved searching in just the headlines as well as using the &lt;code&gt;\w+&lt;/code&gt; feature to find which words were most likely to follow accident.  These turned out to generate the most results than other methods of searching as this limited this to just articles meant to grab attention with the word accident rather than being used in the middle of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other ways this search could be improved upon would be by doing both more research as well as using more data.  This could be done by digging deeper into the articles themselves to compare the similarities between articles in terms of the words in the passage.  Perhaps these articles have a certain area in which to occupy and this could be analyzed by comparing the number of words or the similarities in language to see if they all have a connecting theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/AccidentOccurance/Sheet22:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using Tableau I was able to make the data visible.  The charts indicate the various patterns and occurrences of the term accident itself and when it appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.  The first graph &amp;ldquo;Accident Occurrence&amp;rdquo; was used to show the general trend of accidents from the years 1905 to 1906.  The Table for the reappearance for headlines containing the word accident was used, and the last graph is showing the different categories of accidents and when they appeared in the headlines during these two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These headlines help to paint what this world was like to live in, either through learning about the individual stories that people would have gossiped about in the streets or by even detailing some of the day to day events that impacted the people.  These events are themselves tricky to define as I am sure there were more accidents in the city that did not make it into the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and thus lost to us, but this is a good starting point to gather information on the most exciting and mundane act in an average citizen’s day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robberies in Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-donofrio/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-donofrio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theft should be considered one of the most selfish crimes, as it is literally the act of stealing from others in order to benefit from their belongings. Whether it is out of desperation, or simply for the rush of adrenaline, robbery should not be a crime that is as common as it is today. However, robbery has not only been an issue recently; as shown in multiple issues of &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; from 1905 to 1906. My main purpose in this analysis is to make evident the prominence of theft in Egypt during the time period previously stated. In doing this, I will try to uncover a pattern with the robberies by analyzing when and where the theft occurred, what type of robbery it was and if the crime ended in murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-accumulation&#34;&gt;Data Accumulation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What influenced me to look into the prevalence of theft in Egypt was my assigned Monday issue. On October 29, 1906 alone, there were three news articles reporting a sort of robbery that had occurred.  This made me think that there would be similar articles in other issues. However, the three news stories I had read in my issue used different wording to describe the robbery. This caused me to realize that if I wanted to get the most results possible, I would have to test multiple different keywords. Therefore, I ended up using five different keywords, which combined, gave me 51 occurrences of robbery to work with. The keywords I used each gave me a different number of results: my first search using the word “robbery” came back with 49 items, “burglary” with 152 items, “thief” with 39 items, “thieves” with 54 items, and finally, “theft” with 102 items. It was not uncommon for these keywords to overlap in an article, so I had to ensure that I was not reporting an instance in my data more than once. I decided the easiest way to collect my data was to make an Excel sheet with four columns titled date, place, type of robbery, and if the crime ended in murder or not. I created a typology for the different kinds of robbery; individual, house, business, ship, post office and train. Most of these are self-explanatory, being that a house, business, ship, post office or train robbery is one where items are being stolen from that particular setting. However, to clarify, an individual robbery is one where belongings being held on an individual are stolen. After collecting this data, I plugged it into Tableau, where I created different visuals to present my data in an aesthetically pleasing way, which is shown further in my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;date&#34;&gt;Date&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Mapoftypeofrobberiesthroughoutegypt1905-1906/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aspect of the robberies that I thought would be interesting to examine was the dates that they occurred. I wanted to see if there was a spike in robberies during a certain time period. However, in doing this, I had to acknowledge the fact that the digitization of &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; during 1906 is not fully completed. This could be the possible explanation as to why in the line graph below, robberies decrease in 1906. However, it could be possible that this information is true and there actually was a decrease in theft in 1906 due to possibly stricter security or punishment, which could decrease the desire for people to steal. Something else that I found to be unique was the drastic decrease and then increase between August and November of 1905. It is pretty much impossible to discover the exact cause for the extremity of going from seven robberies in August, to one in October, then back to seven in November. However, a hypothesis for the reasoning behind this could be that after such a large amount of robberies in August, security became tighter, causing theft to decrease. Then once robberies decreased, people might have loosened up security because they assumed robberies were less likely to happen, triggering an increase in theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;place&#34;&gt;Place&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/Mapoftypeofrobberiesthroughoutegypt1905-1906/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant detail I decided to analyze about the robberies was the city in which the crimes took place. As shown in the visual, the majority of the robberies occurred in the northeast region of Egypt. There are many possible reasonings for this trend, including the fact that the capital of Egypt, Cairo, is located in the northeast. In fact, 16 of the 51 robberies took place in Cairo. Since Cairo is the capital, it can be inferred that the city was considered modernized and urban, taking in an influx of wealthy European immigrants. This could be the reason that the capital was targeted for theft. The northeast also has access to oceans, making ship ports another easy target for burglary. Thieves may have been attracted to the immigrants coming in on ships with valuable belongings, as well as materials being imported and exported through ports, like Port Said which had 3 reported robberies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;type&#34;&gt;Type&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I found to be important when analyzing the trends in robberies was the type of theft that occurred. I categorized the robberies by whether it was a house, individual, business, post office, train or ship that was robbed. The two most popular types of theft out of my data are house and individual robberies, each occurring 13 different times. I’m guessing the reasoning behind this is the lack of security. The early 1900’s was a time before high-tech security systems, so homes were not equipped with alarms or cameras making them an easy target. Also, the robbery of an individual may seem easy for a thief as it can go unnoticed through pickpocketing. Another popular type of robbery was train robbery. Again, technology was not how it is today, so one of the most popular forms of transportation was by train. People would most likely travel with their belongings, which may include valuables, that can be targeted easily by thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;murder&#34;&gt;Murder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;murder-donofrio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Robberies that ended in murder&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all 51 reported cases of robbery that I analyzed from &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, only seven of them ended in murder. From this we can infer that theft was not meant to be a violent act, and most likely only sparked violence in special circumstances. Of the types of robbery mentioned before, the murders only took place in house and individual robberies. The reasoning for murders occurring only during these types of robberies could be because of human interference. Theft can be considered a desperate act when someone is in need of items, therefor one may do anything in order to gain those items, including killing anyone who gets in the way. While train, ship, business and post office robberies could occur when no one is working a shift, a home burglary is unpredictable, as it is hard to know if someone is in a house at a certain time. The robbing of an individual is also unpredictable, because if the individual realizes he is being robbed, he may fight back, causing the thief to act without thinking and kill the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obstacles&#34;&gt;Obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collecting my data, I had some instances of difficulty, since the topic I chose is not one that can be found with ease using a query search. Therefor it was very tedious work to have to search each keyword and read through every article to pull out the data that I needed. Another issue that I had to be aware of was ensuring that the article I was reading was an actual news article of a robbery. When I would search my keywords, items other than news articles, like advertisements and reviews, would come up containing that keyword, making the process of reading through the results more time consuming. For example, when searching for the word “burglary” an advertisement for “G. Marcus &amp;amp; Co.” insurance company made up over half of the 152 results, as the insurance company also covers “burglary risks.” Something else that I was considering collecting in my data before I started my research was gender of the criminal. However, once I began my search, I discovered that either most articles did not specify gender, or they had not caught the robber yet, making it difficult to use gender as a category in my analysis. Finally, I would like to ensure the clarity of the fact that although &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is a real publication from Egypt in the early 1900’s, the digitization of these issues was done by students, and can most likely contain flawed, misspelled and inaccurate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robbery was clearly a serious issue during the early 1900’s in Egypt, as 51 cases were reported in &lt;em&gt;The Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The publication also ran follow-up stories on some of the crimes, reporting on whether the thief was caught and updating the public on his sentencing. It was very stimulating for me to look into the data that I collected and hypothesize the correlation between certain aspects of the robberies, like if the place the crime occurred had anything to do with the type of robbery. The frequency of theft in Egypt is just one of the many reasons as to why we have security technology today to catch thieves and more importantly, prevent theft altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stocks and Shares</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-metallo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-metallo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding on my blog post “Is Egypt In a Bubble?,” I dug through the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and traced the “Stocks and Shares” table throughout 1905 and 1906 with as much data available from 1907 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table listed the stock with its stock price as well as its debenture price. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=define&amp;#43;a&amp;#43;share&amp;#43;of&amp;#43;stock&amp;amp;oq=define&amp;#43;a&amp;#43;share&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.5922j1j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; is a portion of company ownership that is sold to the public for which the owner of the stock receives a part of said company’s earnings. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?ei=Ky7eWu2DL4WSzwL2_7T4Ag&amp;amp;q=define&amp;#43;a&amp;#43;debenture&amp;amp;oq=define&amp;#43;a&amp;#43;debenture&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l9.6015.6015.0.6450.1.1.0.0.0.0.114.114.0j1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.112....0.t1UcNE-Mr5I&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;debenture&lt;/a&gt;, is similar to a stock, but instead of the value of the stock rising and falling with the company’s wealth, it has a fixed rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this project was to not only compare the stock price and debenture price of any given investment over time but also to compare both a “gilt edged” investment, meaning a strong investment, to one that may have been suffering in the oncoming financial crisis in Egypt at this time period (as explained in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/metallo-is-egypt-in-a-bubble/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What spurred this investigation were the parallels that I was seeing between the Great Recession of 2008 in the US and the articles written about the Egyptian economy in 1907.  It is true that markets are cyclical and have their ups and downs. For the most part, we can see these cyclical trends coming every 10 or so years. This would mean that exactly a decade before the US market 2008, Egypt would have been feeling the sting of an economic crisis similar to that of the one the US experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When searching for information on the Egyptian market failures of 1907, the Panic of 1907, also called the Knickerbocker Crisis, kept appearing as a result of my searches. The Knickerbocker Crisis was a US Stock market dip that occurred in October of 1907 and the effects of this crash were not limited to the US as explained &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2141305?Search=yes&amp;amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;amp;searchText=panic&amp;amp;searchText=of&amp;amp;searchText=1907&amp;amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dpanic%2Bof%2B1907&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing the financial articles throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, and as noted in my blog post, it is clear that Egypt felt their economy failing and very quickly what was a “localized” crisis began to spread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the crisis was felt abroad, as seen in the article below from the introduction to a quote of a French article. Not only is the crisis officially “raging” in Egypt but is felt all over Europe (which, honestly, has the most to lose seeing as Egypt was still under European rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the visualization of the results from tracing the “Stocks and Shares” table in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.  The strong stock that was analyzed was The Agricultural Bank of Egypt and the stock that was supposedly losing traction in the market was the Land Bank of Egypt. This is not unlike what most consider the cause of the US Great Recession of 2008 and many other economic recessions throughout history, speculation, in particular land speculation (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/43189952?Search=yes&amp;amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;amp;searchText=great&amp;amp;searchText=recession&amp;amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dgreat%2Brecession%26amp%3Bfilter%3D&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;or in 2008 the bundling of blatantly faulty mortgages&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this visualization, it is evident, in a loose pattern, that the share and debenture prices seem to mirror each other. It seems, by this visualization, that the Land Bank of Egypt outperformed the Agricultural Bank of Egypt which is the opposite of what is expected given the information found in the financial articles of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. As to why the debenture price of the Land Bank was so much higher in general than the other measure, I cannot say.  This could be due to improper coding of the Gazette or some other underlying force at the time. To speak to the stability of the investments, the only one that seemed to be unwavering was the debenture price of the Agricultural Bank which we would expect from a “gilt edged” security. The share price of the same investment does not stay as steady but is still much more constant than the Land Bank debenture price.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Big Four Theatres</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-hutson/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-hutson/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was a well-rounded newspaper containing topics varying from weather, plague, sports, and daily trade. There are so many topics covered, it was Egypt’s source of news in the early 20th century. While going through the newspaper, coding it, and reading the different stories, something stuck out to me. I was coding page four of my Monday issue when I read about a show within a small theatre in Egypt. This stimulated my interest in what shows were like in the 1900s compared to how they are now. With all the different events going on within the newspaper, there was a large emphasis on the arts, especially musical art and theatres. This was interesting to me because I was always around live shows growing up. I wanted to see how things were different over a hundred years ago in a different country than they are today as I know it. Also, I wanted to compare the theatres mentioned within the region the newspaper covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-acquainted&#34;&gt;Getting Acquainted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four prominent theatres that occur throughout the newspaper from the years 1905-1907, although there are more that show up. Most of the appearances from these theatres come during our winter months (December-March), I am assuming because that is when most of the shows happened. The four theatres that show up the most are the Zizinia Theatre, Verdi Theatre, Abbas Helmy Theatre, and the Alhambra Theatre. To look more in depth to these theatres I used the query, &lt;code&gt;//head[contains(., &amp;quot;THEATRE&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;. This searched all the headers containing the word theatre. The all caps were necessary because most of the headers coded for use all caps as the header and also used “Theatre” as a search to find the headers with lowercase letters. After gathering more and more information about what theatres were present and which ones appeared the most, I changed theatre to the different names of the specific theatre to narrow my search. The Zizinia and Alhambra theatre show up the majority of the time compared to the other two. Also, the Zizinia Theatre seems to be widely popular, and by far the most popular out of all of them based on the reporting on it. The Alhambra shows up the most number of times trhoughout the paper. The way these theatres worked was a company would rent out the theatre for a certain period of time and put on shows there. A lot of the time there were operas, but other shows range from dramas or comedies. The Verdi Theatre, for example, is a company and they rent out the Cairo Opera House to do their shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;location&#34;&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://110101-313254-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/egypt1215ad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Map of Egypt at 1215CE&#34; class=&#34;lazyloading&#34; data-was-processed=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought when reading into these different theatres was where they were located. I thought the location would give me more insight on how each one functioned, and I could draw my conclusions on the overall performance from there. To my surprise, the Zizinia Theatre, Abbas Helmy Theatre, and Alhambra Theatre are all located in Alexandria, while the Verdi Theatre location is in Cairo. Alexandria is on the coast, which means more people coming through the city such as tourists or just passing through. I think there is a greater demand for theatres in Alexandria because of this foot traffic. Cairo is also a large city in Egypt, but the demand for theatre is less there. The trend for this holds up in the actual stories of the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verdi-theatre&#34;&gt;Verdi Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Verdi Theatre in Cairo struggled a lot during this time period, which surprised me because of the magnificent layout the Cairo Opera House was. The Khedive at the time wanted something superior to anything else, so the building cost a fortune, but was well constructed (LePaitre 1963). However, upon deeper research in the newspaper, reading what the editors wrote on the Verdi theatre, my opinion was quickly changed. On one occasion in the newspaper, an editor was begging the people of Cairo to go watch shows there. They said the theatre was empty and the companies did not want to rent it out anymore. At one point the Verdi Theatre even went on strike because of their struggles. There is never anything of this sort about the other theatres in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggling of the Verdi theatre intrigued me. They struggled at the beginning of 1905, as I was going down the dates, another event was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fire&#34;&gt;Fire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abbas Helmy Theatre caught on fire in April of 1905. No one was injured, but the whole theatre was destroyed, and this caused a few things to happen. After the sudden decline of Abbas Helmy, the Alhambra Theatre received a lot more coverage from the newspaper, and I think this gave them a lot more popularity. Towards the end of the content (around April 1907) there is reporting of the Alhmabra Theatre getting an upgrade. Another cause and effect was the emergence of a new theatre, the Ezbekieh Theatre. However, this new theatre was located in Cairo. This theatre was built next to the Ezbekieh Gardens, along with another theatre next to it. The Khedive made a lot of money by renting these theatres out to various European companies (Barbour 1935).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consistency&#34;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular one, the Zizinia Theatre, had a wide variety of shows such as dramas, comedies, and even the occasional biblical one. For most of the two-year time period, they were occupied by French companies. The newspaper would always comment on how the audience reacted so fantastically to all of the plays at this place. Nothing ever negative was really written about them in the paper, the Zizinia seem like the perfect place to go watch a show. I read a journal review titled, “Alexandria: Its Town Planning Development” (Riad 1933) about the layout of Alexandria as a city and the different things going on within the city. The city seems very well put together. It has a wide variety of buildings and grew up on the Mediterranean Sea experiencing a lot of different cultures and travelers coming through. This gave them a diverse culture, as well as a diverse audience for their theatre shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic was very rewarding as I learned a lot, but it was very challenging at the same time. A lot of the items written about the theatres are repetitive, or not interesting. Since this is a day-to-day newspaper, not everything is exciting all the time. There are a lot of reports on these theatres giving an average show, they give how the audience reacts, and that is it. This repetition over the course of reading hundreds of items on four different theatres was tough. Another challenge I faced was the bias of the newspaper. News in the present day can be very biased and push the audience’s perspective in one way or the other. I am not sure if this is what was going on in the  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, or if they were factual and the Zizinia Theatre was really that amazing, or that the Verdi Theatre really struggled that much. The editors in the paper make it seem like nothing ever goes wrong at the Zizinia Theatre and it makes me wonder if this is just biased reporting because they favor the theatre, or if it was actually a fantastic place to go watch a show. Also, my sample size is only two years, between 1905-1907. During this time, certain theatres could have been thriving while others suffering, but before or after the dates the newspaper looks at, the roles could have been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;things-learned&#34;&gt;Things Learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I learned in general were a lot of European and Middle Eastern companies rented out the theatres. At first thought, I would have expected other African companies to rent out the buildings, but after more thought and research this makes sense. Europe had just decolonized Africa, but this means a lot of European culture was still prevalent in Egypt. Another thing I learned was that there was a certain expectation for these shows. The way editors wrote about them, I could just feel the standard that was set. This leads me to believe that not only the theatre was prominent in Egypt, but the arts as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the reporting is factual, which I assume it is, the Zizinia Theatre is definitely the most popular. The Alhambra theatre shows up the most amount of times, and is also very popular. There are more theatres in Alexandria, and this make sense because of the population, and what that city has to offer. My focus of interest was on events at theatres, that were not actual shows in the theatre. The paper liked talking about these different events such as the strike at Verdi Theatre, the fire at Abbas Theatre. There are also other things mentioned in the paper not a part of the four prominent ones such as an attempted murder that was stopped by the audience, wrestling shows, and another strike. Overall, I think the theatre system back then was the same. In present day, there are more genres and of course more theatres in general. I think the talent level has also increased, with the more variety because actors are expected to be able to portray many different characters, sing, and dance. Whereas in this time period it seems like the level of ability consists of a few genres and mainly singing. However, for the early 20th century, I was impressed with the quality of shows produced and reported on in the Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Egyptian education system in the early 1900s</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-clark/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-clark/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will explore the Egyptian education system in the early 1900s. This project will include the locations of schools that make headlines in the news, including the schools that are being advertised. This will also include what months of the year education seems to be of most importance in the newspaper. I will also look for trends in the school system, such as common problems (Sailer, 1912) or modernization (Saleh, 2012). Keep in mind throughout this paper the changes that Egypt is going through during the early colonization period of 1905. Britain was occupying Egypt during this time and many other countries were represented in Egypt making Egypt a melting pot like America. Education and schools in Egypt were overall successful between 1905 and 1907 because of the new schools built, resolved conflicts, and excellent displays of intelligence from the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first preliminary query I ran was for any div type item that contained the word school, but that resulted in too many vague answers that were repeated and not entirely relevant to my purpose. Ultimately my query boiled down to school* in any headline within the master content folder which returned 234 results. Upon first glance this information would indicate that education is something that the Egyptians took seriously in the early 1900s, but with further research, a lot of those instances of the word school in a headline were simply advertisements for those schools. These advertisements are still relevant to my project, however, because it proves that the school system itself was interested in persuading the parents that were reading this newspaper to send their children off to school through mere exposure advertising. The school that advertised the most was the Berlitz School of Languages, which offered lessons in languages such as French, German, Arabic, and others. I also noticed off the bat that there wasn’t much of a pattern in the months that schools showed up most in the newspaper. The only months that were slightly above average in displaying the word school were July and October, and I will discuss why later in the paper. This lack of dominance by any specific month proves that education was pushed evenly throughout the year, therefore represented well in Egypt throughout the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After skimming through all of the results I noticed that there were certainly a lot more schools that were successful than there were schools that were failing. This was due to the increase in the number of children interested in learning and the many advertisements for schools in Egypt during this time. Even though most schools in Egypt were doing great in this time, the parents and students wanted more funding to come from the Government. The Egyptian Government, however, was pouring all of their money into different public buildings and physically building new schools because the current schools are overcrowded. There were, in fact, four schools that were either built or planned to be built between 1905 and 1907 in Egypt including the fourth secondary school and an Italian school. This progress of the school system proves that the population in Egypt was growing during this time and these people that were coming to Egypt wanted to go to school and learn which is positive for this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the schools that showed up the most in the newspaper, the Berlitz Schools of Languages showed up in the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; 110 times between 1905-1907. This means that the Berlitz Schools took up almost half of my results from my query. For the most part, the Berlitz Schools were simply advertising for their individual language lessons, and the other times they showed up in the newspaper it was for an award they received for doing such a great job teaching. The reason that the Berlitz Schools advertised so often was because it occurred year-round, that is there was no start date and end date so the ads played through every month, because it was more similar to a tutoring service for those who wanted to learn a new language. This is important because it really proves that many different cultures were flooding into Egypt and it was best for people to understand and speak several languages so that they could communicate with each other. The progress of Egypt as a country was clear in population, economy, politics, and most importantly, education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there were a few schools that showed up many times in the paper for prestigious reasons (Berlitz, Zeitoun Blind School, several girls’ schools), there were a couple of higher education schools that gathered fame in the paper for their students’ disobedience. More specifically, in 1905 and 1906 the Polytechnic school and the Khedivial Law school students went on strike against the administration. It was the Polytechnic schools that went on strike first in 1905 because the students were simply unhappy with the way the school was run, but the strike was short lived after the administration threatened the disobedient students with expulsion. However, the absence of strike in the Egyptian schools was short lived because in 1906 the Khedivial Law school students went on strike because of the wrongful expulsion of four students. These law Students were firmer in their strike than the previous Polytechnic students. The Law students released a list of demands, some unreasonable, some manageable, that ultimately resulted in some change is the schools. The Law students went on strike on and off with coming and going support from other students from different schools, such as the Polytechnic School, the Agricultural School, and the Ras-el-Tin school. These strikes were the lowest points for everyone, students and administrators, in the education system because during these strikes there were no students learning what they needed to be learning and the administrators were losing money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the flaw that is the disobedient students, the lack of funding, which was one of the causes for the students to strike, was another huge problem in the Egyptian Education system. According to T.H.P Sailer who visited Egyptian schools in 1907, the schools were dirty, with not enough desks and no real learning materials in the elementary schools, or kuttabs. The Government was still trying their best, however, and it was displayed with how they constructed their higher education schools (with sufficient supplies), and how they pushed teaching as a great job, by not making education majors pay for their higher education (Sailer, 1912). So again the theme of underfunded schools is displayed throughout the younger schools, but in the newer schools, that were built based of the European models, the students and teachers reaped the benefits of the small amount of money that they did receive from the Government.
Furthermore, into today’s Egyptian education system, there are still money problems. The Egyptian government spends 3.5% of their GDP on education which is lower than the international average. Unlike in 1907, however, the Government has stopped persuading children to even attend school as it is still easy to get a job without a degree if the children just focused on honing their skills for civil service jobs (Fahmy, 2008). This lack of interest from the Government along with the continued lack of funding 100 years later is why parents and students are fed up with the Education system in Egypt. Today the school system certainly seems far less successful than it was 100 years ago, because at least in 1907 the schools were advertising for themselves in the newspaper and many new schools were being built. This article proves, however, that a lack of funding from the Egyptian Government has always been an issue for Egypt’s schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the Egyptian education system was doing its best to teach the all of the young, diverse children living in Egypt. Many schools did an excellent job of molding their students into intelligent and respectable young adults. For example, the St. Andrew’s Girls’ Schools (upper and lower), and the Church of Scotland Schools held exhibitions at the end of the 1905 school year where their students and teachers could show off their work from the semester. The end of the school year was typically sometime in late July. So, the students had a small ‘summer break’, if you will, between the months of August and September before school started again in October. All of these exhibitions proved to be important in deciding whether or not the staff of the schools were successful in educating the students, which they were successful for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Egypt’s school system between 1905 and 1907 were as successful as it could be in teaching the diverse group of children at the time. Language skills were pushed on to the children because of the influx of different cultures into Egypt at this time. Although a lack of funding and sometimes out of line students got in the way of a good education, at the end of the day and at the end of the school year, the children proved that they learned something valuable from the schools, which should be the goal of all school systems even today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The fascination with death</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans have a natural sense of curiosity about them, and this curiosity can be innocent such as the fascination with a person they’ll never meet and instead reading stories about them, but it can also be darker and the focus can be on murder and torture. The source of our curiosity stems from a trait of human species call neoteny, according to Tom Stafford of BBC. This trait means that we as a species are more childlike than other mammals and tend to want to explore, whether it be physically or mentally. This trait could explain why the stories about death and murder seem to be some of the most popular articles in the  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since death is such a popular topic among readers, the newspaper probably liked and even encouraged articles and advertisements to write about it because it would please the readers, which in turn would result in more people reading meaning more money for the company. There is a common advertisement found in almost every day’s issue which is titled “The  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;” and is the subscriptions and advertisements article which has information on prices. One of the topics suggested in the advertisement sections is “death” showing how popular and common it was to find articles about it throughout the newspaper. The idea of death is almost a form of entertainment for humans. We love to know how the person died, where it occurred, and if it was a murder, who did it and what motivated them to do so. Criminal forensic psychologist Paul G. Mattiuzzi talks about this concept in his article, saying, “In the real world, there is in fact a practical duty we share in understanding the means and the motivations for crime.  Understanding is necessary for prediction, prevention and protection. But the popular fascination with homicide goes far beyond the practical.  The story lines are a staple of art and literature and a subject for both drama and comedy.  The murder mystery is often most compelling when it abandons reality and is framed in fantasy.” When reading stories about death and murder it is our natural instinct to put ourselves in that position, either the person who was killed, or the person who did the killing. We want to know as much information as we can get our hands on and putting ourselves in those positions allows us to see the different sides. By doing this we begin to think about if faced with a murderer the possibility of escaping or fighting back. Or vice versa think about if you would be capable of committing such a horrendous crime based on the motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of death and how frequently it appeared in the newspaper peaked my interest and prompted me to focus my paper on death throughout Alexandria. Although there have been similar topics, I will be looking at death with a more broad perspective. For my query I chose a fairly simple one to run. At first I tried using the query &lt;code&gt;//div[@n=&#39;4&#39;]//div[contains(., &#39;death&#39;)]/head&lt;/code&gt; to try to get a fairly large pool of data from page four of the different issues containing the word death because page four usually contains the telegrams which sometimes contain news of an important person&amp;rsquo;s death or an interesting death such as murder. It also usually has a few articles on the page which also sometimes contain a story about a death or several deaths, but this resulted in only 48 results which was too few to work with and resulted in such a broad range of items that would be difficult to work with and get the best results possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this failed attempt I settled on a more simple query to ensure that I got a large sample of data to work with. The query I used was &lt;code&gt;//div/p[contains (., &#39;death&#39;)]&lt;/code&gt;. This looked in each paragraph within a div and found any item that had the word &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; inside. It resulted in 953 items from which I took the dates from each time it occurred and made a frequency graph to find which months the most deaths occurred. From this data I came up with this graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/datagraphfrequencyIFS/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these results we see that the months with the highest death rates are June through September for both the years 1905 and 1906. The highest deaths total was in September 1906 with 68 deaths. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge surprise because there is usually a high birth and death rate during the month of September, even to this day. These results show that this window in time is quite possibly a sick season and the reason for the high amount of deaths could be from an easily contracted and spread illness. There&amp;rsquo;s a possibility that since this time is around the holiday season that families could be together and there could be tension among relatives that could possibly result in murder, or it is also a high stress time which could cause heart attacks and other natural causes of death. These are just assumptions and the sickness theory is the only trend to be easily identified because death is hard to predict and can be caused by many factors. With this in mind I wanted to find what some of the main causes of death were. To do this I used the same query but instead of death, I put in different words such as &amp;ldquo;Murder&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Stabbed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Shot&amp;rdquo;. The following pie chart shows these results along with the percentage of deaths caused by each category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-fitzpatrick/fitzpatrick-methods-pie-chart_hu6f2a2680e83c5f9748949a05fb4e8e72_150283_dd5bed60661a48833932b560b71e4c34.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart shows that the most common form of death was from being shot followed by poison then murder and the plague tying for third. Stabbings and a general sickness each caused only 3% each of the deaths. The low percentage for sickness makes sense because the Bubonic Plague was also a fairly common disease at this time and many of the people who died from being sick were probably caused by the Plague which is a separate category. The remaining sickness I presume was from Typhus because I read several articles where it was mentioned as a cause of death. The high results for murder, the plague, and being shot seems reasonable but the very large 26% for poisoning seems strange and inaccurate. This could be caused by misinformation or that there was a popular advertisement or article that talked about poison and was found in many issues of The  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that the results could be skewed due to a lack of updating each issue. There could be duplicates of stories, or if there was a popular advertisement that appeared often it could tamper with the results and cause an unusually large pool of false information. The contents of the  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; are continually updating, so there is a portion of important information that is missing that could help clear up any uncertainties and offer a wider data set to compare trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; delves into detail about the plague and its various forms. The cattle and bubonic plague both created epidemics in Egypt especially from 1905 through 1907. The spread of the bubonic plague swept through Egypt during the early 1900s. Regions across the nation including districts of farms, small towns, hubs, and port cities were all infected by the mass illness. The epidemic did not only hurt the well-being of residents of Egypt, but it resulted in a change in agriculture, markets, the economy, and the habits of everyday life for the residents of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gathering-data&#34;&gt;Gathering Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequent articles under the “Local and General” section prompted me to discuss and analyze the different plagues in Egypt and how they correlate, if a correlation does exist. I began this analysis by first narrowing down the searches of the plague into a reasonable number of returns to search through. The query I used, &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot;]/div[contains(.,&amp;quot;plague&amp;quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;, searched through the Local and General section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; for the keyword “plague”. This search came up with 133 results. I then organized these searches into three categories based on the most frequent words that came before the plague using the regular expression search of “\w+ plague”. The most frequent words used before the plague were the words “the”, “bubonic”, and “cattle” along with other variations of words that can be found in this word cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching through the variations of word combinations with the plague, I noticed many of the results came from the same articles that used the word “plague” multiple times. Therefore, I changed my xpath query to &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;local&amp;quot;]/div[contains(.,&amp;quot;plague&amp;quot;)]/head&lt;/code&gt; to search only in the headings of the “Local and General” section. This search resulted in 47 queries with 31 results being “the plague”, 9 results being “cattle plague”, and 7 results being “bubonic plague”. From these headings, I was able to get a better understanding of the frequencies and dates of both plagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague epidemic began in the early 1900s with a sweeping illness that resulted in 843 cases of the plague in 1904 and 501 deaths as a result. Throughout Egypt, methods of preventing the plague and its spread began to arise to prevent further fatalities and sicknesses that occurred as a result of the plague. The most prominent reason why the plague was being so quickly and widely spread was because of the strong trading business that occurred in Egypt during the early 1900s. Top locations that showed the highest fatality and contractions of the bubonic plague typically incorporated port cities of Egypt and large hubs. Alexandria, Suez, and Port Said were some of the main cities that had the highest records of the bubonic plague in Egypt. As a result, beginning in 1905, cases of the bubonic plague struck Egypt and its citizens through contractions from other nations. The bubonic plague became a record-breaking epidemic in Egypt. The average rate of contracted illnesses that were a result of the plague was approximately 7 per week and approximately 4 deaths per week from the plague. Nations and regions including India and Upper Egypt have spread the disease through merchants and traded goods between the two locations. As distinguished by Sir H. Pinching and Dr. Cresswell the “infection conveyed …. had been infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt”. Through the use and distribution of these goods the plague impacted many civilians such as one case in January of 1905 that caused the illness of fifteen people and three deaths caused by the bubonic plague. This resulted in a search and cleaning of multiple ships and shipments that may have been affected by the plague. Many ships were seized if they were found to have traces of the plague and taken into quarantine. The search and seizure of many ships that had goods that were impacted the plague also resulted in different maritime procedures and a delay in times for the passages of ships – resulting in delayed voyages and arrival of traded goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the bubonic plague, another form of plague quickly spread across Egypt as well. The cattle plague came across Egypt from Sudan and infected the cattle of Egypt and the produce market as well. The outbreak first came across Sudan and then impacted Egypt through imports from Sudan. The epidemic only affects cattle and cows directly and causes the death of these animals in large quantities. However, the cattle plague does affect humans indirectly also. The lack of cows leads to a lack of products that result from cattle causing a shift in the Egypt economy, market, and dietary habits of the people of Egypt. The cattle plague also affects the residents of Egypt since the consumption of milk and other products that originate from cattle may result in illnesses to the individual who has digested it. Although the cattle plague was still a significant epidemic in Egypt, it did not affect as many humans as the bubonic plague did. In two articles of the “ &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;” that discussed the cattle plague, readers can analyze how long the cattle plague was a significant epidemic in Egypt and surrounding regions. Articles from January of 1905 indicate that the cattle plague began in late 1903 and continued severely through the middle of 1905. Although, the cattle plague lasted until 1906 with scarce and spaced out incidences of cattle plague diagnoses. In 1904, 5,065 deaths in January were recorded as a result of the cattle plague. In 1905, the total cases reported in January of the cattle plague were 146,791. However, in 1905 measures to end the cattle plague began which resulted in less cases being reported and less fatalities as a result of the cattle plague. One measure taken in order to end the plague was having the cattle being treated with vaccinations to immune them from the illness. In the same time period in 1905, 884 animals were treated with the vaccine. The treatment of animals to prevent the cattle plague overall worked in certain regions in Egypt. In 1906, the cases per week shifted from hundreds of reported diagnoses into an average of 3 per week in May. However, as certain regions became clear of the epidemic, other regions began to break out in the epidemic if the government did not choose to prevent the plague before it arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-analysis&#34;&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both the bubonic and cattle plague, the peak season for cases was during the summer months of 1905. The two peaks for each type of the plague were in July. However, the bubonic and cattle plague have no direct correlation to each other as represented by the data from the reports of the  &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. The graph depicted below shows the correlation between the bubonic and cattle plague in Egypt and how they have similarities in ranges but no direct correlation. If there were a direct correlation, the peaks of both lines in the graphs would have been more in sync that they currently appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the plague in Egypt through the articles of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; was useful since it offered a direct source of the plague and its effects of the people of Egypt. However, varying sources of information from a different lens would have also been useful in addition to the newspaper. Since the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; typically holds the lens of a journalist to inform readers, other point of views that could have been vital to an analysis of the plague of Egypt could have been those found in a medical examination or historical research paper. Additionally, because this is a form of micro-history dating back to a century ago, some data may have misprinted or lost while creating the microforms of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Such information may have improved my analysis since there are months without updates of the plague that may have skewed results found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Theatre</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-castro/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-castro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/templates/#calendar-of-coming-events&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Calendar of Coming Events&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandria had many events listed and lined up from Monday to Saturday. Typically, these events consist of many different activities including people going to the theatre, listening to the orchestra, or dressing up to attend glamorous galas. I noticed that in the Coming of Events Calendar there were many reoccurring theatre names. I decided to research the different types, and the most reoccurring theatres in Alexandria between 1905-1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to locate the different types of theatres within Alexandria, I ran an XPath query searching in element of the Coming of Events element. I received about a little more than hundred. I also used the regular expression to search anything with the word theatre within the template. In my original XPath I searched through the whole content file, but I realized that I did not have it updated. This caused my search to include the element tag instead. As a result, I had to update my content folder and then began my XPath search again. I received a little less than my original XPath search, but I copied my work and placed it into an atom document. I also used regular expression to be more specific with my search and took at all the mentions of theatre within the Calendar of Events. My XPath query result then was the following: &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;comingEvents&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; with regular expression &lt;code&gt;\w+ theatre&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in atom, I deleted everything that was not labeled or named theatre. I realized that there were a couple of misspellings and I corrected them. Overall, nine theatres were constantly contracted and used for different events. These theatres including the following: Esbekieh, Eden, Theatre des Nouveautes, Alhambra, Esbekieh Garden, San Stefano, Zizina, and Abbas. Based on the four most mentioned theatres in Alexandria, I decided to do another XPath search. I wanted to understand the different importances of these reoccurring theatres, and I began to research the number one theatre, the Esbekieh Garden theatre. Then, I continued my search by exercising multiple Xpath searches by using the Calendar of Coming Events tag and placing the specific name of each theatre from my original search. Although it was difficult because the Calendar of Coming Events has a specific template, I excluded the items that did not have a description following. However, I did keep the theatres which had the type performance such as Italian comedy or French comedy. Initially, I only had a couple of theatres under the year 1905, but after searching through each individual theatre more results were gathered for that year. As I gathered my results in a tableu worksheet, I discovered that most shows were seasonal. Most of the theatres occurred during the fall beginning in August and ending in January or February. My data ranged from the year 1905 to 1907, but the majority of my results were within the first two years possibly because most of the class encoded their issues from 1905 and 1906.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/CalendarofEventsNEW/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the novel &lt;em&gt;Egypt and How to See it&lt;/em&gt; written by Lamplough, the Ezbekieh Gardens was a small threatre, where during small intervals of time small French plays performed for the Egyptian people. The author also recognized another one of the reoccurring theatres in my XPath query search named the Abbas Theatre. It is clear that Egypt held a vast majority of culture such as French and Islam. These types of evidence can be seen throughout the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;; for example, the &lt;em&gt;Notes de Critique&lt;/em&gt;, which are often written in French. However, in the Abbas Theatre, they shared many different cultures, as well. According to Lamplough&amp;rsquo;s novel, the Abbas Theatre held many Italian opera, grand, and light, and French opera. It is stated that these French and Italian operas were very successful and held nearly twelve hundred people, and the author even mentioned that the seats were quite comfortable adding to the Abbas Theatre&amp;rsquo;s attraction. This is understandable because Egypt did not have particular demographic. In fact, during the 20th century, the population of Egypt included Jewish, Islamic, and other races and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing all the different types of theatres, it appeared that most of them held different types of appeals either comedy or drama. Additionally, according to the essay &amp;ldquo;Theatre in Egypt Before and After the Revolution,&amp;rdquo; Egypt transformed due to the rise of independent theatre at the beginning of 1990s. As a result, my XPath search indicated that within the first couple of years of the 20th century the threatres in Egypt were very prominent. Furthermore, the author of the article Joseph Fahim states that the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; theatre we know today had its roots in the folk traditions and streets of Egypt. In fact, the theatre began to boom in the 20th century when Egypt became the cultural hub of the Middle East. I can tell from the articles that Egypt and its cultural society held an important impact both culturally and socially. This is shocking because many people would not consider Egypt as a cultural prosperity because Egypt is often recognized during the Roman Era and Cleopatra&amp;rsquo;s reign. Egypt in any other light including as the central attraction of the Middle East and hub for culture and entertainment in the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my search towards other theatres and it appeared that the Zizinia Theater held more activities than any other theatre. I began another XPath search for only the word Zizina Theatre with the Calendar of Coming Events and many different types of activities occurred during the month of October such as benefits during 1905 and 1906; for example, including Money Benefit for the Jewish Hospital and El Owa el Woska Benefit Performance. According to my research and data, the theatres were scheduled between the months of October to February possibly due to benefits and other seasonal events. I decided to further investigate the Zizinia theatre and these types of benefit events. According to the article written by the Free Popular University in Egypt, on Sunday 26 May 1901 this particular university was declared officially opened at the Theatre Zizinia in Alexandria, thus, making it one of the most frequent and common theatres in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, according to the biography &lt;em&gt;Omar Toussoun: Prince of Alexandria&lt;/em&gt; by Sahar Hamouda, El Owa el Woska was an Islamic Benevolent Society. Therefore, the Zizinia theatre became an important part of the Prince of Alexandria&amp;rsquo;s social and charity work. The article demonstrated that the theatres in Egypt, especially the Zizinia Theatre, were a great source of revenue and social axis. It is evident the Prince of Alexandria supported the arts and theatres which, in turn, created a source of income for Egypt. The introduction of the famous and royal citizens using the theatre must have greatly contributed to constant appearance in the Calendar of Events and, overall, increased the popularity of the theatre to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/CalendarofEventsNEW/Sheet2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the article also stated that events at the Zizinia Theatre often occurred during the start of the year and during spring around April. This supported my data visualization because most of the theatres within Alexandria were in production from October to April including the Zizinia Theatre. It appeared that these were the times when most of the benefit performances and holiday performances occurred, thus causing most of the theatre events to be circled around winter through spring. For example, the Prince of Alexandria, Omar Toussoun, placed many of his benefit performances during the months of spring such as April. Additionally, the theatres had other specific genres such as comedy or drama. Throughout my search, I discovered that most of threatre, when not hosting charity events or galas, held either Italian or French comedies and dramas. According to the &amp;ldquo;Ideology and Culture of Power in Late Ottoman Egypt&amp;rdquo; by Adam Mestyan, the Egyptian culture included theatres of different language and events such as the French and Italian operas which were quite common during the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/CalendarofEventsNEW/Sheet3?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the theatres within Alexandria and Cairo became an important factor for Egypt. I was surprised to realize Egypt was the center hub for many cross cultural and artistic events. It is evident that the theatre was an important development for Egypt for economic reasons, but it was also important culturally because it created the foundation for the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; theatre seen today. The &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is a great source to analyze and discover the different types of cultures and social relations within the people of Egypt during the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wedding and Funeral Flowers</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-ell/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-ell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see similarities between funerals and the type of arrangements mentioned in the articles. I took notice of the date these weddings were happening, and if orange blossoms were used. I did research that showed during the 1900s orange blossoms and myrtle flowers were very popular in royal weddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;topic&#34;&gt;Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking through issues of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, I found many features about weddings and funerals. I was interested to see if trends were popular during certain seasons during 1905 and 1906. Having a wedding announcement in the newspapers may also require a position of authority. I became interested in the trends that may also carry over to weddings outside of the Alexandria and Cairo area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;importance&#34;&gt;Importance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding information about &lt;em&gt;Queen Victoria’s&lt;/em&gt; wedding in the mid-1800s, showed that she had a crown of orange blossoms, which started a trend into the 1900s. Royal weddings are always of interest to people reading in multiple different countries. I also found information about orange blossoms and their role into Chinese wedding celebrations. “There are few trees so prolific as the orange; it is one of the rare that blooms and bears fruit at the same time, thus becoming symbolic of fruitfulness. During the Crusades, the custom was brought from the East first to Spain, then to France, then to England in the early 1800s.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Victoriana.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interested&#34;&gt;Interested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedding have always been of interest to me because they are such a happy celebration. Flowers are also one of my favorite things, I love to look at them and help my mom with the garden at home. In present times flowers are a focal point for weddings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;x-path&#34;&gt;X-path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by looking through the entire repository with the keywords &lt;em&gt;“wedding”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“flowers”&lt;/em&gt;. However, these findings weren’t the most focused or helpful. I then tried using &lt;em&gt;“marriage”&lt;/em&gt; and was able to find more articles with descriptions of the wedding ceremonies. Upon talking to Professor Hanley, we decided to also look for funeral information. I then searched for &lt;em&gt;“funerals”&lt;/em&gt; and looked through the articles for flower arrangements. Once I found specific articles I was planning to use, I also searched for &lt;em&gt;“orange blossoms”&lt;/em&gt; to see what results came back and see if they corresponded to articles I had already found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing x-path queries it was fairly simple as far as finding articles, and then narrowing down my results. When first using the term &lt;em&gt;“marriage”&lt;/em&gt; there are over six hundred results, however upon looking through them it is easy to see they don’t fit the article type I need. Some of these articles simply talk about advertising for marriages, deaths or illnesses, and other simply say that a marriage occurred. Using &lt;em&gt;“wedding”&lt;/em&gt; narrowed the result to one hundred and forty-three articles, which offers a lot better descriptions on the ceremony and decorations. “Orange Blossoms” brought back ten results that were the most helpful in this analysis project. On the opposite side, &lt;em&gt;“funeral”&lt;/em&gt; brought up a fair amount of results, two hundred twenty-four, which had a mix of good and bad articles. Again, some simply talked about funeral advertisement space, and others gave information about services. The search that gave the most confusing results, was &lt;em&gt;“flowers”&lt;/em&gt; this is such a common word that it comes up in battles, market shops, and as names. I decided to specifically look at orange blossoms instead of the generic flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resultsdifficulty&#34;&gt;Results/Difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found over one hundred results for both weddings and funerals. Some of these instances had the flowers specifically named or how they were arranged, but the majority didn’t mention either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not any direct correlations between the date of the weddings and if they had orange blossoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quotes&#34;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One remarkably consistent usage was the symbolic meaning of “Chastity” attached to orange blossoms. Queen Victoria elected to wear orange blossom- her only floral adornment- at her marriage to Prince Albert on 10 February 1840.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; -&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/65305/headdress-from-the-orange-blossom-parure&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/65305/headdress-from-the-orange-blossom-parure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Orange Blossoms are also popular in other countries around the same time. Garlands and crowns were used in Greek weddings, that included olive branches and herbs, as well as white flowers and orange blossoms, which stood for sweetness and happiness.  Rome couples followed a similar custom to Greek wedding flowers, weaving greenery and blooms into garlands and crowns, scented with orange blossom, roses, thyme and basil which wards off evil and&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; -&lt;a href=&#34;https://weddings.lovetoknow.com/wiki/History_of_Wedding_Flowers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://weddings.lovetoknow.com/wiki/History_of_Wedding_Flowers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My research topic is communication and travel in Alexandria/ Cairo, through means of Telegraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;method&#34;&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;//div//head[contains(.,&amp;quot;EASTERN TELEGRAPH CO. LTD.&amp;quot;)]//following-sibling::table[contains(.,&amp;quot;FROM&amp;quot;)]//following-sibling::cell[1]//string()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code was used to acquire the information analyzed and assessed in the paper. It reads every cell after the first cell of a table containing “FROM,” within a headline that contains “EASTERN TELEGRAPH CO. LTD.” Inside of each division of all the pages of every file inside of the content folder of the repository from the course website. The data is given in a form containing the date and desired data of the pages assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research is to analyze records of messages - asked by the people whom inhabited the area - to be sent to Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and London. The information will be displayed in various forms throughout the paper and will be analyzed in relation to events occurring around the time, more so understanding the actions that would have occurred in Alexandria/ Cairo from 1905 to 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1905 time, the British Occupation Army began to become more so relaxed in Alexandria causing the citizens to feel slightly lied to as they continued to show their authority over the people of Egypt by making decisions regarding their land and relationships. The data collected showed two areas that sent the messages to the other areas of the world. The first location was referred to as “The Company’s Office H.M.” The slight variation regarding period of time for messages sent from this group likely means that it had been used by more private companies/ industries. The other location was “The Postal Telegraph Office H.M.” A company that seemed to send messages from the citizens of Alexandria as well as the British Occupation Army Soldiers and Officials. Each of the locations seemed to be used by different members of the area due to the different amounts of time that it would take for each to send messages to the cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records of Telecommunication during 1905 seemed to be healthy, likely being used by some citizens and soldiers – whom knew people in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and London. A similar period of time for messages had been sent during that year in relation to other years. Though, the times were different for each year’s month, the same areas received the fastest messages. The country of London has been observed to have the most messages being sent in every month of every year (other than February 1907). This large period of time for messages recorded information being sent to a city shows the population of the army, which would have likely lived in the differing locations with the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of the British Army in Egypt and the soldiers they were with during the time would do messages sent to London. Many messages were likely sent in the years during which the Egyptians would have noticed they were not going to leave peacefully without being confronted about the problem. As stated by Stephan Luscombe, “as the Suez Canal continued to grow in importance… the conviction grew that the British had no intention of leaving.” This seems to be rather true in relation to the plans made with France, causing the Northern area of Africa to be Great Britain’s Share and the lack of Egyptian members of the parts of the government, which made important decisions for Egypt and its people. The “temporary” guests from a foreign land were already sowing the seeds of anger in the land of Egypt. The action resembles someone asking to stay in your home, but then sleeping with your husband/ wife. Their actions were clear, to establish complete control over Egypt’s government then its people; the next event which occurred showed this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While assessing the data, the highest amount of time for messages were sent to each of the areas directly before and after June 1906. The month seemed to be the period of great unrest and interest for the people of Cairo. After assessing the information, I began to perform some research on the time. The day of June 12, 1906 (Figure 1) was the day of the Denshawai, soldier incident; there have been several iterations of the story told about the event since the time of its occurrence. A general summation would be some soldiers came back from the hunting pigeons and met a crowd of citizens who needed the birds for food, there was a fight and then a woman had been shot by a soldier causing the citizens to become more upset and on soldier was injured and left the group of soldiers. He later died due to exposure from the sun during his attempt to return to the camping ground, he was found next to a citizen whom had been attempting to help him. The man was thought to have killed him and was beaten by another group of soldiers, fifty other members from the group of citizens were then judged and had received punishments for their acts. Two people were sent to death and the others were given prison time and 50 whips. The actions, which occurred toward the people in the town were not just or fair, they were the way the colony controlled many of the areas they inhabit. As the views and thoughts on the Denshawai incident varied the manner of which it had been told to other people also varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the event messages sent from the two locations in Alexandria to the cities in Europe were done so at more similar speeds for both postal areas but still not the same. Though, the citizens would still be able to send messages, they would likely. The assumption is that the soldiers from London going on their month-long breaks then returning to the area two months before the event; continuing their communication with their friends and family after they returned. This would be shown in the large increase of the times of messages recorded and sent during April and May 1906(Figure 1). During June the amount of time for message’s speed increased to a time that was rather distinct from the other points, this had been likely due to the imposition of the soldiers on the people. After the Denshawai incident the citizens were highly upset with the British Army and the ways that the event was handled, along with the strange manner of the punishments to the people who were considered innocent. As expected for the two months following the events of the Denshawai Incident, the amount of time taken for messages sent out to other areas had increased and had been the largest amount of time taken for messages during the three-year period. This was most likely due to the British leaders sending messages to their officials about the event, soldiers speaking with their friends and families, and the Egyptians whom desired as many people to know of the British forces’ acts against their people. As well as the amount of pressure put onto the telegraphs that would not have really been done in the year before. The British may have also given the citizens slower telegraphs on purpose to be able to give the citizens in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London their views on events before everyone else, first impressions are everything…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though after the incident, there was likely less use of the areas to send messages due to the punishments the government had been giving some of the citizens who spoke of it in journals. The amount of time taken for messages sent to Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, and London during the rest of the year and during 1907 had been the least during the years. The reason may have been the lack of events that occurred in the area causing soldiers to send messages to their friends and families. Many of the citizens would no longer have a need to send information to the areas within Europe after the time. Though, the cause of the decrease may relate to the Nationalist groups that had been created, and the soldiers whom were likely told to arrest any members they might have been found committing any acts against the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of data had been sufficient in determining the changes in the times needed for messages to be sent to the assessed locations from Alexandria/ Cairo. Though, if the research were to be continued on the topic the manner of collection would need to be improved. To attain the data a program had been made which analyzed data in an excel document and converted it into a format that could be converted into a chart. The current data being added onto could be done so with more efficiency by utilizing a general text editor to organize the information that would forma it in the correct manner to be converted into a chart. Attaining more information on the actions of the British Occupation Army such as the times they returned and the thoughts of the soldiers in relating t the incident and the way that it had been treated. Though, the messages had been sent it was rather difficult to attain one that would have kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was attempted by the current researcher but was not able to be performed due to technological miscommunication of information of different systems (Mac and Windows). To improve the presentation of the information in a visual context different forms of the time presented could be used, as the other styles would cause the information of the graph to be too large to quickly observe.  Along with this the use of the map feature would aid in providing a vivid example of the data in relation to the areas in the United Kingdom. Also assessing the units would aid in conserving time and increasing understanding of the information analyzed. Along with assessing data as true by association of similar information, though the actuality of the events may be properly represented in the data. Although as time, years, increases the performances and speed of the devices would likely increase causing the amount of time to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shipping in Colonial Egypt</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-wallace/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-brainstorm&#34;&gt;The Brainstorm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world in the twenty first century is one that is connected, by the internet, but also by the seas. As Michael B. Miller said in his book, Europe and the Maritime World: A Twentieth Century History, that “commercial maritime world helped to shape the modern world’s organization of consumption and production”. The topic of how shipping works and how it affected the world then is in reality, a study of how our world has came to be. The world economy is driven in part by the movement of goods across large bodies of water. The twentieth century was no different as this is when shipping people and goods became something that a middle class person could do. As someone with a minor in geography, how people interact with others on a global scale is of great interest to me. When I learned we would be doing a project such as this in the class I knew I wanted to do something with the globalization of trade. This is the era of the steamship, as shown by the plethora of ads showing off the prices of travel. The steamship revolutionized global trade as it opened up new trade routes that were previously unavailable due to wind patterns. As it is quite obvious how important these steamers are, that raises new questions. Where are these ships going and when? What is on these ships, people or cargo, or both? Did the proportion of ships with humans versus cargo change throughout the years? What about the overall volume of ships going back and forth, did that change? These questions are the ones that this analysis seeks to answer. This is a history class, in part at least, and this microhistory blends well into the overall fabric of industrialization of the twentieth century. Each ship makes up a tiny story in the sea of history (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-information&#34;&gt;Background Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get this raw data in the first place, my fellow classmates had to use Microfilm which possessed the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; on it. We all collectively have scanned this newspaper using microfilm machines, specifically the ScanPro 2000. A very tedious process begun after scanning this pages, because it was necessary to split the page into fourths in order to get better image quality. You then had to stitch up these fourths into one image again so that you could finally OCR (program that allows you to scan an image and convert it into text). This is the graft that a microhistorian has to do in order to get the historical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serial-question&#34;&gt;Serial Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the questions listed above are relatively specific, considering the scope of the source material. This topic though can be pulled back a bit to find something that can be applied more generally. My goal is to learn how shipping from and to Egypt changed over the three year period in which the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; is available for research. Unfortunately the findings of this study can&amp;rsquo;t be too intensely generalized to the shipping world in general because of the scope of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. In light of all of this, I arrived at the question of “What is the usage and frequency change in shipping in 1905-1097 Egypt as represented by the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xpath-query&#34;&gt;XPATH Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to search the full contents of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, a Xpath query had to be formulated. This allowed the total contents of the newspaper to be searched in its entirety from 1905 to 1907. This XML search needs two things to be successful, a where and what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; was relatively easy, find anything to do with ships right? No, because that gets every ad and listing in the paper, which there are many. The search needed to be refined, so the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; changed to &amp;ldquo;shipping&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;ship&amp;rdquo;. This still wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to be used in any substantial way. Finally the solution was found, the xml id for a section of the paper called &amp;ldquo;shipping movements&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where&#34;&gt;Where&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The xml id of shipping movements made the where easy, I just then needed to get the content out of the division. This was done by searching for every paragraph inside of the feature &amp;ldquo;shipping movements&amp;rdquo; by using the query of &lt;code&gt;//div[@feature=&amp;quot;steamerMovements&amp;quot;]//p&lt;/code&gt;. I collected the data after updating the working sets to the most current pages. This was done on Wednesday, March 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the sections that were pulled for research were OCR&amp;rsquo;d correctly so they had to be either corrected by hand if they could be figured out what they were supposed to say, or they had to be deleted if they were too poor to even guess. Often times place names, one of the essential parts of the question, were incomplete or misspelled. There would be awkward spacing or formatting issues, as well as sometimes where the section would be the same for a couple days, showing that a person most likely copy and pasted the same template from either their own issue or from someone else for several days and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to change the values and content to reflect what the their specific issue said. There is a big possibility for missing out on many instances of the section if people don&amp;rsquo;t use the xml id, as this is the hinge that holds this search together. The actual extracting of the data from the sentences were no easy feat either. Regular expressions were able to help but copious amounts of effort was put into getting the data by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Xpath query, there were 698 instances where the xml id for &amp;ldquo;shipping movements&amp;rdquo; were used. Each paragraph contains a listing of the name of the ship, usually the company, where its going/when its getting to Egypt, the date of arrival, and what they had on board the ship either people, cargo, or both. Sometimes the ship will list some specifics of what cargo they were carrying, listing the amount with its unit measurement ex. (1000 bales cotton).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visualization&#34;&gt;Visualization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better visualize the data, a word cloud was created in order to display the frequency of destination to and from Egypt. The bigger the word, the more often it occurred in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, looking at the hard data, the top ten is as follows, with number of occurrences provided,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;292	Malta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;273	Alexandria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;207	Liverpool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85	Manchester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;74	Marseilles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;49	Antwerp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very interesting results on their own, but they will eventually contribute to a overall patch work of the wider question. One peculiar thing to come out of this search is the fact that Malta seems to be the top destination for ships to and from Egypt. Looking at bit deeper creates some doubt to the validity of this finding. Malta was very small with a tiny permanent population of people, how could they be the biggest trading partner for one of the biggest colonies of the British Empire? Looking even deeper into the actual text of the newspaper, often times the listings include that the ship will be going somewhere via Malta, probably due to its location in the Mediterranean. Malta is a good stopping point to restock and get ready for the second leg of their journey. Alexandria comes next in the list, most likely because that was the principle port for the Egyptian colony, even shipping to other parts of Egypt. The first real destination listed is Liverpool, this isn’t too surprising as it was one of the busiest shipping ports in the United Kingdom. Manchester is next on the list, as one of the first industrialized cities in the world, it possessed the need for raw cargo. This shipping route from Egypt helped supply this demand, and via the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the two cities were incredibly connected economically as well as physically. In order to get a picture of the entire scale of this shipping operation, a map was created using the coordinates of each city to plot them geographically.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Note: In the newspaper, all ports in the USA were listed as “American Ports”. The coordinates of Boston were used to represent all of these American Ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is three general regions to categorize the places in which these steamers were headed. The Mediterranean region,  the British Isles region, and the Far Reaches region. The first two are self explanatory, while the Far Reaches are used to categorize the ports in Australia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steamers carried lots of things to and fro, but three main categories emerged in the newspaper, passengers, mails, and cargo. The cargo is further broken down into the types that were shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;wallace-ShippingCargoBarYear.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shipping Cargo Bar Year&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Note: The onions, cotton, timber, and coal are all part of the overall category of cargo, so they are included in the total number on the bar graph above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo was the clear winner as one would expect, while passengers are second, followed by mails. Cotton was the most common type of cargo with coal coming after. This graph however does not allow for comparison over time because of the lack of data in 1906 to a degree and especially 1907. Smaller intervals of time have to be used to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Shipping Cargo Bar Quarters&#34; srcset=&#34;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph shows that there is a pretty constant level across all three categories until you reach the third quarter where there is a jump in mails while passengers and cargo rise but not to the same degree. This makes sense as the third quarter is the ending of the summer months and the fall, a time of year where many crops were harvested. Cotton is a good example of this, as it rises significantly in the fourth quarter. After all the harvesting and processing were done, they were able to be shipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to look at the change in place over time, a bar graph was made, plotting by month. The findings of this graph make sense with the other evidence that’s been presented so far. The summer months have a lull as people left Egypt to escape the summer as well as a lack of significant crops to be harvested during the summer months. The fall and early winter months have a flurry of activity of cargo shipping and people coming back after the hot summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In asking the question about shipping, valuable trinkets of information can be gleaned from the data. The main port cities that Egyptian steamers shipped to and from like Liverpool, Manchester, London, Marseilles, Mersina, etc. This reinforces the current ideas about British shipping, using it mostly for self production but then also selling goods on the world stage. As for the change in cargo specifically, we are able to track not only when the Nile floods but also when summer is by deriving patterns. The Nile flooded during the summer and cotton was planted, and then harvested in the fall/winter months. Passengers rose and fell with the coming and going of the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this data turns out to be basically what you would expect. This window into the past was very enlightening and I’m glad I had the opportunity to conduct microhistorical research. I would hope however that a student down the line can polish up my data and go further once 1906 is complete and 1907 has some meaningful data. My methodology was strong but the lack of substantial data over a longer period hindered my results. The biggest hurdle was trying to extract the data that was needed out from the sentences, and the next scholar to try and tackle this question, I implore you to find a better pattern than I did.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/@30.0302842,31.1812774,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1DunCjoyI8KrRBpKhOk1C7EDsJijzv3J3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link to live map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-and-cultural&#34;&gt;Social and Cultural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my results, I was able to find that in the summer months the amount of visitors visiting the hotels increased. In Egypt tourism became a vital part of the Egyptian economy after the construction of the Suez Canal had been completed. The hotels included in my results are all along the Nile River and the opening of the Suez canal made it much easier for people to get in and out of Egypt from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;During the second half of the nineteenth century, a new system had emerged, one that would subsequently be applied to Egypt and Sudan. The new centerpiece of this new structure was the &amp;lsquo;Resort&amp;rsquo;. Resorts were dedicated to tourists&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;querying-results-and-haptics&#34;&gt;Querying Results and Haptics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query that I used to find the hotels listed in Cairo is Query: &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &amp;quot;Cairo”)]/head&lt;/code&gt; and in text to find I put &amp;ldquo;Hotel&amp;rdquo;. Finding the query that would give me the answers that I wanted took me a long time. I initially asked myself where I would be able to find hotels in Cairo within the Digital Gazette. The answer that I came up was in the advertisements section, Local and General, and the Social sections of the issues. I began by trying to run the query &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; that would give me the titles of all of the hotels within the advertisements section. This was unsuccessful because the query was not answering my question of what the most common hotels in Cairo were. The query that I was running was not specific enough toward the location and gave far too many results to decipher. The next query I began to run was specific, however it was far too specific when trying to answer my questions because it did not give me any results. Many of the queries I tried to run failed because some of the results were in element or feature, which made it hard to find a full set of data. The biggest issue that I ran into was being specific enough to generate a query, but not too specific where I would get a small number of results. After trial and error, I was able to finally retrieve the query Query: &lt;code&gt;//div[@type=&amp;quot;advert&amp;quot;][contains(., &amp;quot;Cairo”)]/head&lt;/code&gt; with the text finding the word hotel. This query finds an advertisement that contains the word Cairo in the head and hotel somewhere in the text. This query is not perfect, however it did assist me in answering the question that I posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query that I was able to retrieve for the hotels answered my question of what hotels in Cairo existed in Colonial Egypt, however this query still did not give me an accurate representation of the people who attended these hotels. I further had to construe a query that would answer the question of who visited the hotels and when the people visited these hotels. When coming up with a query to answer this question, I discovered the element: &amp;ldquo;visitList&amp;rdquo;. When making a query for visitList, this was difficult because I wanted to make the results specific, yet attainable. I began with the query of Query: &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;visitList&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;, this query gave me results that stated yes, meaning that that there was a visitList element in the issue. I needed to make the element much more specific. I generated the query &lt;code&gt;//div[@element=&amp;quot;visitList&amp;quot;//persName]&lt;/code&gt;. This did not give me results as it still was not specific enough. I generated results to find persName within the visitList attribute with using regular expression &lt;code&gt;\W\w+ \W\w+&lt;/code&gt;. This regular expression would give me the results for people within the visitList that were tagged with persName. The results for this test came up for me, however many people that coded for the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt; in XPath did not use this tag. I generated results for only a couple of dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/visitList/Story1?:showVizHome=no&amp;amp;:embed=true&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Visitors in Cairo Egypt in 1905&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/visitList/Story1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strengths that I found with using Xpath and generating results using regular expression were that it was able to find a specific answer for me if I asked it the right question, however if I asked the right question some of the results would not populate if others did not put on their end the same exact XML markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking about a topic such as hotels in Egypt, it is important to find scholarly reviewed text for a more accurate understanding of the topic at hand. I was able to find three articles to assist me in answering the question about tourism and hotels within Cairo.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/23062746?Search=yes&amp;amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;amp;searchText=hotel&amp;amp;searchText=colonial&amp;amp;searchText=Egypt&amp;amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Ff1%3Dall%26amp%3Bf3%3Dall%26amp%3Bq1%3Dcolonial%2BEgypt%2B%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bed%3D%26amp%3Bsd%3D%26amp%3Bc3%3DAND%26amp%3Bq0%3Dhotel%2B%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bc6%3DAND%26amp%3Bq2%3D%26amp%3Bf4%3Dall%26amp%3Bc1%3DAND%26amp%3Bf2%3Dall%26amp%3Bf5%3Dall%26amp%3Bf6%3Dall%26amp%3Bf0%3Dall%26amp%3Bq3%3D%26amp%3Bisbn%3D%26amp%3Bq5%3D%26amp%3Bpt%3D%26amp%3Bq6%3D%26amp%3Bc4%3DAND%26amp%3Bc2%3DAND%26amp%3Bq4%3D%26amp%3Bc5%3DAND%26amp%3Bla%3D&amp;amp;refreqid=search%3Adb8b6213b82816d7b3da77e796434632&amp;amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE THOMAS COOK ARCHIVE FOR THE STUDY OF TOURISM IN NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
explains how tourism in the Middle East and North Africa took a dramatic incline during the 1880s. The essay details how “Mass tourism is synonymous with the name of Thomas Cook and Son Ltd.” Thomas Cook and Son Ltd. helped pave the way for tourist coming in and out of Egypt after they developed “the Nile transit service while simultaneously opening up Syria/Palestine to travelers.” This information is important because it explains why the hotels included in this visualization were popular during their prime. The visualization depicts five hotels in Cairo, and all but one of these hotels are all situated near the Nile River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scholarly article that I have used as reference is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4289940?Search=yes&amp;amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;amp;searchText=hotel&amp;amp;searchText=colonial&amp;amp;searchText=Egypt&amp;amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Ff3%3Dall%26amp%3Bf6%3Dall%26amp%3Bc1%3DAND%26amp%3Bed%3D%26amp%3Bq0%3Dhotel%2B%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bf4%3Dall%26amp%3BcurrentPath%3D%252Faction%252FdoAdvancedSearch%26amp%3Bf2%3Dall%26amp%3Bpage%3D2%26amp%3Bsd%3D%26amp%3BsearchType%3DfacetSearch%26amp%3Bf0%3Dall%26amp%3Bf1%3Dall%26amp%3Bc5%3DAND%26amp%3Bc2%3DAND%26amp%3Bc3%3DAND%26amp%3Bc6%3DAND%26amp%3Bc4%3DAND%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bf5%3Dall%26amp%3Bq1%3Dcolonial%2BEgypt%2B&amp;amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tourism and Empire: The Thomas Cook &amp;amp; Son Enterprise on the Nile, 1868-1914&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This article details how tourism is a widely Western phenomena. &amp;ldquo;A product of the industrial revolution, modern tourism was founded, developed, and perfected in Britain, western Europe, and North America during the second half of the nineteenth century&amp;rdquo;. Tourism in Egypt was a new concept during the early twentieth century. This concept is important to think about and analyze within the Digital Gazette because the citizens of Cairo and neighboring cities like Alexandria were trying to understand tourism as a means to stimulate their economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my analysis project, I focused on the minimum temperatures of Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria and how they differed from May 1906 to April 1907. The goal was to see if there were any significant differences between the minimum temperatures and if so, what caused these variations. I chose these three cities for a number of reasons. I am using Alexandria as the base measure because the “Egyptian Gazette”, the newspaper from which I collected the data, is based in Alexandria. I then tried to chose stations that had minimum temperatures recorded as often as possible. Some of the minimum temperatures in the “Other Stations” table of the “Daily Weather Report” were not recorded as often as Port Said and Suez. By picking these two locations, I am able to have a continuous line graph with enough data points to create a decent line graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;procedure&#34;&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the three cities that I chose to collect data from are located all across the border of Egypt. Alexandria, the main focus of the “Egyptian Gazette”, is located on the northern border and is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, which allows for sea travel. Alexandria is one of the most northern cities out of the three and thus further from the equator. This allows for less intense summers and cooler winters. The second city, Port Said, is also up north, but is closer to Israel and Jorden. It is also right up on the Mediterranean Sea and is a great location for shipping docks. Because it is the other more northern city of the three, it is located further from the equator and may experience different minimum temperatures than the third city. Suez is the third and final city that I chose to collect data. It is alongside the Suez Canal, hence the name, and is more south than the previous two cities. I choose three cities that varied in location because I wanted to see if there were any trends when it came to the minimum temperatures of each area.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Daily Weather Report” appeared in almost every issue of the “Egyptian Gazette” and was an important section of the newspaper. It provided readers with a handful of valuable information regarding the weather for the specific day. It was important especially during this period because it was one of the only ways to quickly find out the temperature for the day. The “Daily Weather Report” also listed out other bits of information about the weather like the sun rise and set times, the humidity level, the force of the anemometer, and the heat of the sun. These were all valuable information for readers to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that I gathered came from the “Daily Weather Report”. The data for the Alexandria temperatures came from the “min. temp in the shade” row, while the minimum temperatures for Port Said and Suez came from the “Other Stations” table and the “min temp in the shade” column. When it came to getting data points for the minimum temperatures in Alexandria, I used the XPath query: “//table//cell[contains(.,&amp;lsquo;Min. Temp in the shade&amp;rsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number()”.  I used the “Daily Weather Report” to the best of my ability; I accumulated the minimum temperatures of the three specific locations, put them into an excel spreadsheet, imported them to Tableau, and created three continuous line graphs that show the varying temperatures from May 1906 to April 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of my analysis project was to determine if there were any major differences between Alexandria and two of the lesser known locations, Port Said and Suez in their minimum temperatures due to the various locations of these three cities. In order to do this, I gathered the minimum temperatures from Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria from the dates of May 1906 to April 1907. This span of a year allowed for a good amount of data points that would show the fluctuations in minimum temperatures in Port Said, Suez, and Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that some of the minimum temperatures may be incorrect. Human error is to blame; some people would forget to update the “Daily Weather Report” with the correct minimum temperatures. On the other side of the spectrum, sometimes the “Daily Weather Report” could not be located in the “Egyptian Gazette”, or the “Other Stations” table was absent. To compensate for these issues, I removed any null data points from each visualization to try and create a better flowing line graph. Another issue that is important to note is the reliability of the data. As time progresses, the technology advances and gets better and more accurate. The minimum temperatures that I collected may not be 100% the actual minimum temperature of the area, but it is still important to look at the data and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing by data, I came across some similarities and differences between the three cities in Egypt. For instance, all three of the locations experienced a spike in temperatures on June 15th, 1906. While this date may not be of any importance besides the fact that all three stations shared higher temperatures than normal, it is an interesting trend to note, especially since the minimum temperatures for the rest of the period do not come close to June 15th’s temperatures. A key difference is the fact that during April 1907, the minimum temperatures in Suez were significantly higher than those of Alexandria and Port Said. This may be due to the location of Suez on the Suez Canal. The canal may lead to sea breezes and higher temperatures to be recorded. Besides these small details, the minimum temperatures for Port Said, Alexandria, and Suez all follow a similar path; it gets warmer during May and June and stays constant until December when the minimum temperatures start to fall into the single digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the “Egyptian Gazette” is a newspaper based in Alexandria, it begs the questions of why did the editors and writers choose to include the maximum and minimum temperatures of other stations in their paper. One reason could be that since Alexandria is located adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, there may be a good number of people who make trips from Alexandria to other areas like Port Said. By giving these sailors the maximum and minimum temperatures to various stations, the are better prepared for the weather and know what to expect. Another reason could be that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the minimum temperatures at Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez allow for better comparisons to the current minimum temperatures in these locations. The dates that I studied, May 1906- April 1907, were over one hundred years ago. Since there is such a large gap of time between then and now, I am able to look at the minimum temperatures for those locations now and see if there are any notable differences. Climate change is a topic that has been hotly debated for a while now. By comparing the minimum temperatures for these areas, there might be a definite sign that the Earth is heating up and thus increasing the temperatures in many areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/joc.1321&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that I found did something similar to my analysis project, but with more stations and only observed the average summer temperatures. Nonetheless, their study was eye-opening and gave me better insight to the varying temperatures of my three chosen stations. The article was published in 2006, a hundred years after the years that I studied. The researchers, Hasanean and Basset, looked at the average summer temperatures for 19 separate locations all over Egypt, including Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez. They were only able to find a limited number of reliable temperatures for their 19 stations, so they did not start looking at the average temperatures for Alexandria until 1942, Port Said until 1941, and Suez until 1968. They stopped collecting data for each of these stations in 2000. Hasanean and Basset found that the average temperatures in the summer increased in areas like Alexandria and Suez, but slightly decreased in Port Said and other Upper Egypt areas. When comparing their data to my data, one can observe that the 1906 summer average in all three stations was lower than Hasanean and Basset’s data, thus leading to the idea that there is some form of global warming occurring that makes the average summer temperature raise by a couple of degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first began my analysis project, I did not know that I would gain better insight into the recording and reporting of the weather in Alexandria. Yet, as I continued to conduct research and collect data, I learned that the “Egyptian Gazette” played a vital role in reporting weather data. As for the minimum temperatures in Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez, it is clear that there are similarities between their minimum temperatures. All three roughly experienced the same minimum temperatures with the exception of a couple of instances previously discussed. By studying the minimum temperatures in Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez, I gained a better understanding as to why the “Egyptian Gazette” chose to include the minimum temperatures for both Alexandria and a number of other stations across Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
