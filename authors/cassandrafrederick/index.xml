&lt;p>The point of my serial topic is to learn more about a culture, that until recently I had never heard of, and how that culture is treated and viewed by different peoples. The culture I am referring to is the African Pygmies and the goal of this paper is to learn more about them and their treatment in Cairo. I became interested in this topic when I read an article in my section of the paper entitled “Pigmies in Cairo.” The title struck me as interesting and caught my attention as I was spending hours on OCR correction. I read the article and quickly discovered that this was a topic that was very interesting to me and would, hopefully, make a good serial question for my individual project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One problem that I have encountered in my research for this analysis is that the querying process refused to work on my computer. I followed the procedure found in the tutorials on the course website word for word but it refused to work for me. I then began an arduous process of looking through multiple page images in order to find an article about the Pygmies in someone else’s issue. The articles that I have found were very similar to the ones in my paper with very few differences mostly relating to where the pygmies would go next and any troubles in the process of getting there. One such problem was gaining permission to travel to London, England. This was largely the subject of the first article about the pygmies in my issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the similarity in these articles, I had some difficulty in finding out who the pygmies were as a people. I decided to do a bit of research into the people to get a general idea of the culture discussed in the articles. What I found is that the pygmies are largely similar to any other indigenous African people with their own language, dances, village life and customs. The large difference between this culture and others is their height. These people are much smaller than the people of other cultures with the height of the average full grown man being 4’11”. This fact made the pygmies very interesting to the Europeans and those trying to make a buck off of their interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Colonel James Harrison of Yorkshire comes in. He came across the indigenous pygmy people in the Ituri Forest during his travels and brought some of the pygmies back to Cairo. This was only a waypoint as he eventually paraded them all around London so that people could see the short people from Africa. In this sense, they were seen almost as circus freaks as many people in England had never seen a fully-grown adult that was as short as the Pygmies. Colonel Harrison promised to return these people to their homes when the tour was done and whether or not that promise was kept is not known to me as it was not discussed in the articles that I found.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deadly Dates</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-29-frederick-deadly-dates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-29-frederick-deadly-dates/</guid><description>&lt;p>You love your family but there’s always those cousins that just annoy you so much that sometimes you just want to feed them some poisoned dates so you don’t have to deal with them anymore. Well that’s precisely what one man of Makhadoora village did to his cousins in May of 1905. This nameless man injected compressed dates with enough of a deadly poison to kill those who ate it. He then gave these deadly fruits to five of his cousins, two men and three women.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three women ate the dates and “expired in great agony.” Now if you are not a psychopath, you might be confused as to why this man decided to off his cousins and especially in such a cruel and painful way. Did they inherit a large sum of money from grandma while the killer only received the nice china? Did they eat all of the stuffing at Thanksgiving when they knew it was his favorite?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, due to the lack of information provided about a motive or even a name for the killer, the world may never know. One thing that is known however, is that this event did cause “considerable excitement” throughout the neighborhood due to the simple fact that it was a murder as opposed to an accidental date poisoning. In my opinion, this fact implies that the neighborhood in Keneh where the murders took place was not used to this violence which might mean that it was a fairly well-off neighborhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does this mean that the motive could involve money? It could certainly be a possibility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technology Troubles</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-29-frederick-technology-troubles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-29-frederick-technology-troubles/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the first few weeks of this semester I was completely dedicated to toiling for hours in order to receive an “A” in this class. I would stay up until midnight finishing editing text that was OCRd making sure that no detail was overlooked. I would spend hours working on this editing only to go back to it and find that all of my hard work had either disappeared or been undone and not for lack of saving. When I started working with Oxygen, I would find that a file I had just started coding the previous night could not be found when I went to open and edit it the next day. This setback has been a source of major frustration for obvious reasons. I don’t know whether this unfortunate series of events is occurring because of some delayed karma or because I have the dreaded apple computer but it has caused me to become lazy with the workload. That being said, I have prayed to the computer gods to fix my issues so I can save my grade and it seems to have worked so far. In the wake of my realization about how quickly the semester is coming to an end I have kicked back into gear and have decided to push through any and all technical difficulties.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
