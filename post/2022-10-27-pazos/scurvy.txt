title: "Prison Scurvy"
subtitle: ""
summary: "In Egypt, 30 cases of scurvy occurred in prisons. This interested me because nowadays, scurvy does not happen in prison even though some prisons don't serve the most nutritious of foods. This made me wonder how bad the food must have been in the prisons in terms of nutrition, where the prisoners were being fed but got so little nutrition that they developed scurvy. From the sources I looked into, Egypt had a very developed prison system, however it was mainly focused on punishment rather than rehabilitation. This makes me think that the prisoners that developed scurvy most likely lost some sort of food privileges, such as fresh vegetables or other sources of Vitamin C. By the 1900's, the causes and prevention of scurvy were well known, so no one actually died from getting it, and the worst of the cases were mild. Overall, from my research, prisons in Egypt were far from the worst that the world had, and the prisoners had medical care and some rights and were not left to die."
