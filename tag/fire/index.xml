The first fire occurred on Saturday at 2 p.m. at a tobacconist on Attarin-street. The second fire occurred at a second tobacconist. This time it was at 2 a.m. Monday morning on Munet el-Bassal. The third fire occurred only an hour later at a grocer&amp;rsquo;s shop in Attarin-street. Fortunately, the fires only caused slight damages and no one died.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The frequency of these fires is quite strange, mainly because it is winter when these fires occurred. This wouldn’t stand out as much in the summer because in the summer it would be easy to &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-meyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“cause a fire by heat from the sun”&lt;/a>. Another strange part about this article is that it doesn’t mention the cause of the fires. The paper also dedicated a relatively small part of the paper for what is a significant story. Even if those fires in particular didn’t cause much damage, it is likely that if the causes are not identified then more fires will continue to occur. If the causes are identified, however, then precautions can be made in order to prevent the fires from occuring. It is also clear that these fires are not an isolated incident because the advertisements about fire insurance are rampant in the Egyptian Gazette.&lt;/p>

On January 4th, 1907 for example, the Gazette reports a large fire on a gunwharf that caused thousands of pounds of goods to be destroyed, officially estimated at a current value of 250,000 British pounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another instance of the debilitating effects of fire mentioned in the Gazette was on January 10, 1905. This fire broke out on Tousson Street in Alexandria, at a store filled with chandeliers, lamps, and large amounts of petroleum. Although a fire engine was on scene 5 minutes after the alarm was activated, eight hoses continuously dumping water could not stop the fire for two hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These announcements had vital potential impact on the citizens of Alexandria to raise awareness of the absolute devastation fire could cause and the necessity for precautions against such a danger. The Gazette&amp;rsquo;s report of fire damage from around the world served the purpose of bringing a more thorough knowledge of the universal issue of uncontrolled fires to the people of Alexandria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the fire fighting techniques of the day were not entirely effective, as realized in the above example, the explicit, long term, and life threatening effects of fire were a necessary understanding among the people of Alexandria in those years, and the Gazette provided consistent documentation to serve that purpose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Train on Fire</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-clark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-clark/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the issue of Monday, October 22, 1906 in the Egyptian Gazette there was a short article on page three written about an express train, heading from Luxor to Cairo, that caught on fire due to an exploding lamp in one of the first-class cars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article gathered my attention for several reasons, the first of which being the words fire and exploding lamp. The only other blog post with an explosion was larger scale, but it was done on purpose. &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/Chatham-Explosion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about this military-style explosion&lt;/a>. Lamps actually exploded fairly often in 1906 because electricity was fairly new and the light bulbs must not have been built properly. &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/light-bulb-failure-and-heres-why-1152457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about the quality of light bulbs in the early 1900s&lt;/a>. Apparently to deal with this burning train car, the best plan of attack was to detach it from the rest of the train and send villagers to put out the fire, which makes sense so as to not allow the fire to spread all around the train, but what about the people inside the car that was on fire?? This brings me to my last point of curiosity, which is certain members of the crew that helped put out the fire. According to the paper “Three Italians distinguished themselves by the coolness and the effectiveness with which they worked.” This just proves that Italians must’ve been cool all throughout history and still are to this day because I’m just imagining three big guys with slicked back hair in suits named Tony communicating wonderfully with each other and the other villagers to put out this train fire. This brings to mind a different blog post about close knit communities in Egypt, because the community of Kift must&amp;rsquo;ve been close with one another to put out this random train fire. &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/barrett-curiosities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about the togetherness of the Egyptian community&lt;/a>. The article concludes with the fact that there were no injuries in this fire, which is pretty miraculous considering the assumed lack of experience among the villagers who worked to put out the fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, flaming trains are not a thing of the past in Egypt. In the early 2000s a train caught fire due to an illegal use of a gas stove. The passengers of this train weren&amp;rsquo;t so lucky as there were at least 373 confirmed deaths. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/21/brianwhitaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about recent train disasters in Egypt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
