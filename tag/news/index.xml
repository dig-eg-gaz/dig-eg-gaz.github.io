Intrigued by the interest the public had in the movements of their leaders, I began looking into how many times specific leaders were mentioned when I noticed a pattern: the importance of their wives. Despite having no significant job themselves, the wives of powerful men were mentioned continuously in the Gazette.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As in the case of the Crookshanks, Mrs. Crookshank was mentioned almost half as many times as her husband, despite not being the one influencing public policy. However, while she may not have held office, Mrs. Crookshank and many other wives like her held their own unique influence over the public in an emerging role: the celebrity. &lt;a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t74t6hh6b&amp;amp;view=1up&amp;amp;seq=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the diary of diplomat Thomas Skelton Harrison,&lt;/a> Mrs. Crookshank is repeatedly mentioned and described in personal detail, whereas her husband is only listed for his duties. This suggests that It is well known that &lt;a href="https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/gender-roles-in-the-19th-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women had great influence in the home&lt;/a> during this period, but they also were able to influence society as a whole in the social sphere. As suggested by women becoming aware of their autonomy and worth, which can be seen in Sonali Pustam’s &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-pustam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post,&lt;/a> gender roles began to change in the 1900s. This pattern is reflected in the mentioning of wives of politicians as public figures in their own right. &lt;a href="https://raw.githack.com/dig-eg-gaz/content/master/1905-11-18.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Crookshank’s outfit&lt;/a> at a wedding is even reported in the Gazette with no mention of her husband, a true sign of her individual status. As seen in another &lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-analysis-pustam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post by Sonali Pustam,&lt;/a> women’s fashion was being reported more in the 1900s, a sign of the continuing influence that upper class wives had on the general public.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rest in Peace Miss F. Collins</title><link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-15-austink/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2019-10-15-austink/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was looking through my papers and noticed an interesting article that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to align with the theme of the local newsletter. In the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em>, mostly everything is generalized and for the benefit of the reader but there was a section titled &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-02-17-0202160131-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obituary&lt;/a> and it was interesting because it was on one specific person. As I read I realized that even though she did just seem like another local, the point of the article was to show how &lt;a href="http://www.globalthinkersforum.org/our-impact/each-and-everyone-of-us-is-unique-and-important-and-no-one-is-insignificant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every citizen is important&lt;/a> and it made sure to explain how she was a quality person and her death was to be mourned as many of the locals in Luxor and Cairo cared for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Each and Everyone of Us Is Unique and Important, and No-one Is Insignificant”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I find this fascinating because there are two other instances I found while browsing through the blog posts in which the &lt;em>Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em> has done this.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2017-04-23-baenen-deathofthepasha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the death of Haicalis Pasha&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-fitzpatrick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of Mr. Hanna&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In both instances the newsletter is reporting local deaths and it shows that the community do care about its people and that no passing is meaningless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the important things that was pointed out in the Obituary is how Miss Collins spent a majority of her time at church and actually passed while at a Sunday Service. It is safe to assume that she is now in &lt;a href="https://www.everystudent.com/journeys/then.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heaven&lt;/a> because not only did she realize God but also lived an honest life.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
