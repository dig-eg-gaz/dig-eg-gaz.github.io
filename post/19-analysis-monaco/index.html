range of maximum temperatures from data taken from different stations
in Alexandria, Egypt. I chose to investigate the timeline of May 1906
to April 1907 with the hopes of finding whether or not there are
correlations between the temperature of each location themselves. In
combination to this, I also will make inferences between why some
stations are higher than others and how that can relate to how busy
they are. With this in mind, I can further make inferences about foot
traffic and how that affects pollution levels in more popular or less
popular places, inherently affecting temperature data.</p><p>There were a couple of general questions that motivated me to focus
on this topic. The general topic of my group analysis project had to
do with looking at temperature change over the decades over the
country of Egypt, so I knew I had to do something within those
parameters. One guiding question I came up with is as follows:
“Do the measures in the heat of the sun section from the ‘Daily
Weather Report’ part of each issue of the newspaper flow accordingly
throughout the months recorded and will this data bring about any
sort of significance on other topics prevalent during this time in
Alexandria?”</p><p>I take a genuine interest in climate change as a global topic in the
present, so seeing how it influenced and was reported in the past was
something I was excited to learn more about. After I drafted this
first question, I began to make inferences about what I thought would
answer the question. Recalling the historical time period of the
European and American Industrial Revolution, I drafted this next
sub-question:</p><p>“How do higher temperatures recorded in various stations around
Alexandria change with the increase in industrialization measures?
With the past two general questions in mind, I decided to combine
them and some other smaller thoughts into the one big question that
serves as a general guideline of the project. It is stated below:
“With the investigation of the maximum temperature data taken from
various issues of the Egyptian Gazette from May 1907-April 1908, what
changes are clearly visible from location to location and how can
these implications be discussed in a social climate?”
Furthermore, let us continue the investigation by taking an interest
in the XPath Query I used to find the basic data.</p><h3 id=xpath-query>XPath Query</h3><p>As far as the XPath Query goes, I wanted to make sure I chose a
search that would funnel out all of the data I did not need, leaving
me with relevant and applicable numbers. Using the entirety of the
content folder from Github as the identification of sources I was
searching from, I used the following query to find the maximum
temperatures as recorded in different stations in Alexandria covered
in issues of the Egyptian Gazette : //table//cell[contains(.,&lsquo;Max.
Temp &lsquo;)]/following-sibling::cell[1]/text(). This search will give me
the results I need and exclude any irrelevant data, like minimum
temperatures for example. Each issue of the Egyptian Gazette has a
“Daily Weather Report” including a multitude of sources of
information. Some of these sources include the “Maximum Temperatures”
table, the “Minimum Temperatures” table, and more. Once I&rsquo;ve
restricted it to the daily weather report, I needed to restrict it
further to just the heat of the sun which I did here. The last part
of the query including the “text()” is something I included to leave
the option open for me to further consolidate my research. Just for
interest, I filled in vocabulary such as “population” and “climate”
to learn more about the subject in context. But, the main usage for
this part of the query is where I ended up figuring out how to search
for the time period I was looking for. I got a little over 50 results
from this query, which I thought was a pretty good number to work off
of. Although my group and I originally decided to leave the data
unrestricted because we thought a lot of tables would have holes in
them, we decided to collectively and individually constrict the data
to about a year’s time so we could make quick predictions about
future weather reports across Egypt.</p><h3 id=data-visualization>Data Visualization</h3><p>After gathering the data results from Oxygen, I then exported them
into an Atom file and used regular expressions to eliminate
unnecessary components. After this, I continued to export the edited
Atom data to a spreadsheet which was then opened in Tableau. After
playing around with the design of the graph and choosing the axes, I
decided to make a side bar graph to display the results I felt would
be most welcoming to the individual interpreting it. The visual is
below:</p><p><figure id=figure-initial-bar-graph-of-heatof-the-sun-averages-for-each-month><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=w-100><img alt="data visualization" srcset="/post/19-analysis-monaco/datavisualization_hu86425b9c3f32bc9a24e4b1f257e909c0_40039_01974c38759c9d661644b743431496f1.webp 400w,

of the Sun Averages for each month.</figcaption></figure></p><p>My original plan was to create a couple of graphs displaying the
average temperatures in each location as recorded in the Egyptian
Gazette , but while deciphering the data from Oxygen, I changed my
mind. I found there were a lot of gaps in the data over the time
period I chose, which was concerning. I figured it would not be a
very accurate form of data if one station has way more numbers to
factor in than another, which is the main reason I decided to just
keep it simple and use a wholly average graph. A lot of the
components of the graph had dashes instead of actual data points,
which led me to believe maybe the data was inefficiently taken or
there was an issue during publication of the section. If we look at
the visual presented above, maximum temperatures spark during both
April and July. There is a severe decrease in overall maximum
temperatures in January and more obviously February. This was one of
my initial predictions for the data visualization as I figured the
temperature rates would be consistent with the season they were filed
into.</p><p>In an overall sense, the data flows pretty well in the graph above. I
do think it would have been helpful to include the graphs displaying
averages per station from May 1907-April 1908, but I also think it is
important to keep the data as accurate as possible. The whole idea of
this project is generally looking at the effects of high temperatures
in different places and how that impacted parts of society back then.
A general graph supports a general idea, so I believe that “Figure 1”
graph gives a good idea and supports the overarching idea of the
study.</p><h3 id=significance-of-the-data>Significance of the Data</h3><p>I find this subtopic particularly interesting because I take an
interest in climate change presently, so I think it’s cool to look at
the range between low and high temperatures in Alexandria during the
time period specified. Focusing more on maximum temperatures taken at
different stations in Alexandria lead to explanations dealing with
problems affected by high temperatures. These can range from health
problems, like maybe an increase in sickness with warmer weather or
in response to pollution. A link to a published book that I found on
Google Scholar, Observed Changes in Minimum and Maximum Temperature in
Nile Delta, Egypt in the 20th Century, by Ebtisam Mohamed and Maged
Hussein discuss the increase in temperature in the popular river
throughout the 1900s. Both authors take a range of temperature
samples from the Port Said location and the Cairo weather station
while simultaneously running multiple statistical tests to find
correlations. This article includes data on an annual scale, which is
cool to look at because it corresponds with the data found in the
Egyptian Gazette .</p><p><a href=https://platform.almanhal.com/Reader/Article/85154 target=_blank rel=noopener>Link to book</a></p><h3 id=historical-context>Historical Context</h3><p>Similarly to other nations adopting the industrial standard in the
late nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century,
Alexandria was no exception. An article published by Professor Bent,
an instructor at the University of Oxford, discusses agrarian change
throughout Egypt from 1800-1950. Although this is a super broad time
period, it does include the annual range included in my data and
observations. Bent concluded that the industrial revolution in Egypt
earned its start towards the 1860s-1890s, and proceeded with more
efficiently produced technology up until about the 1930s (Bent 4).
From then on, scientists and business analysts alike researched
efficient and inefficient trends in consumer behavior and the
environmental impacts. I thought this study was pretty interesting to
read because it advocates the interconnectedness of people and
businesses, and how everything impacts the environment as a whole. In
the topic of maximum temperatures, more severe changes to the
environment seem to take measures according to Brent. A higher
population means more pollution concentrated in an area, which will
raise the overall temperature as plotted by the temperature charts.
This can lead to further investigation into how the climate will
change in certain areas dependent upon how many people inhabit that
area.</p><h3 id=research-remarks>Research Remarks</h3><p>After completing the process that served as the basis for this
investigation, I have learned a lot about the accuracy of data
collected from the Egyptain Gazette , basic ways to interpret
microfilm, and its overall importance and further implications. I
feel all of these subjects are vital to understand. As far as
accuracy goes, the initial holes that I found in my data when
researching specific stations and dates for their data showed me that
there were times errors occurred and the result was a lack in
numbers. Every time this happened in an issue which I found in Atom,
it decreased the general value of that specific issue and its weather
section specifically. Studying past weather trends, especially in
ever changing climates like Egypt, is important in giving us
information to base predictions for climate change in the future.
Further applicable case studies can be used in similar experimental
designs to show correlations in more detailed settings, but in order
to study the most trustworthy data, you need trustworthy numbers.
This is not always available in the case of the Egyptian Gazette.
Moving on to the actual scanning of the microfilm itself, I learned a
lot about what individuals were interested back then as I performed
markups on the XML documents. The advertisements paid for by the
supplier taught me a lot about graphic design back in the day and
market/advertising design. Using primary sources like issues from the
Egyptian Gazette is extremely helpful in deciphering data from older
sources. This newspaper was produced more than a century ago and is
preserved, thanks to technology, until more than the next century. If
computers, software, and scanning machines were not around today,
then it would take a lot more work in researching and displaying the
data collected for this topic. Although there are some issues with
how trustworthy the data collected is, the technology used to
interpret the data is very helpful in displaying it and sharing it
for others to learn from or be motivated by.</p></div><div class=share-box><ul class=share><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/&text=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-twitter aria-label=twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/&t=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-facebook aria-label=facebook><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="mailto:?subject=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]&body=https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-email aria-label=envelope><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/&title=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-linkedin aria-label=linkedin-in><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a></li><li><a href="whatsapp://send?text=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]%20https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-whatsapp aria-label=whatsapp><i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/19-analysis-monaco/&title=Maximum%20Heat%20of%20the%20Sun%20in%20Different%20Stations%20Across%20Alexandria%20[May%201906-April%201907]" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-weibo aria-label=weibo><i class="fab fa-weibo"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="media author-card content-widget-hr"><a href=/authors/mikaylamonaco/><img class="avatar mr-3 avatar-circle" src=/authors/mikaylamonaco/avatar_hu5da1a3994fe0a0b775b79de918c189e0_74056_270x270_fill_lanczos_center_3.png alt="Mikayla Monaco"></a><div class=media-body><h5 class=card-title><a href=/authors/mikaylamonaco/>Mikayla Monaco</a></h5><h6 class=card-subtitle>Student</h6><p class=card-text>The author, a student at Florida State University, was enrolled in the digital microhistory lab in fall 2019.</p><ul class=network-icon aria-hidden=true><li><a href=https://twitter.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mcm18 target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></div></article></div><div class=page-footer><div class=container><footer class=site-footer><p class="powered-by copyright-license-text">© 2022 Me.
