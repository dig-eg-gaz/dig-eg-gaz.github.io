      <title>Fluctuation in Egyptian Cotton Exports Throughout the Year</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-grieco/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For millennia, cotton has been cultivated extensively in Egypt along the banks of
the Nile Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My serial question involves looking at a snapshot in the historical trends of the
cotton trade in colonial Egypt. During Egypt’s years under British colonial rule,
cotton became an incredibly significant and profitable cash crop. Following the
decline in American cotton production because of the American Civil War, England
turned to Egyptian cotton as a source of profitable trade within its empire. To
gain a sense how the cotton trade behaved during this period, my analysis uses
data sourced from cotton export reports from various issues of the English/French
language financial newspaper The Egyptian Gazette over the course of the year 1905.
Specifically, the data looks at the amount of cotton exported to certain countries
on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing the history of modern Egypt, the development of cotton manufacturing
is an invaluable topic. Mohamed Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, first
encouraged commercial cotton production in Egypt in 1822. With the arrival of cotton
came the arrival of finance in Egypt, as European banks encouraged Ali and his successors
to borrow at exorbitant interest rates to modernize Egypt, with huge sums of capital
coming from the new cotton trade. The most dramatic effects of this irresponsible
borrowing came into play when Egypt came under rule of Mohamed Ali’s grandson,
Ismail. Ismail wished to turn Cairo into the “Paris on the Nile” through extensive
investment in Egyptian infrastructure, borrowing even greater sums of money from European
banks, and the opening of Suez Canal. Though the combination of these revolutionary
factors did modernize Cairo and the rest of Egypt to great lengths, they also sealed
Egypt’s fate of colonization by the French and British. Ismail became so indebted to
foreign banks and financial entities that England and France forced him to abdicate in
1879 and once again claimed Egypt for their empires, this time as a single-crop colony
capable of producing trade and profit in the modern world through its extensive cotton
production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian Gazette is a very interesting resource in regards to this topic as it
provides extensive data on various cotton-related exports and trade during the year
1905. The data sources I have chosen provide monthly reports, mainly because the summative
nature of these reports is an attribute which I find useful for examining macroeconomic
trends. These monthly cotton tables also provide the destinations of the bale exports,
something which provides digital historians such as ourselves many unique and fun ways
to present and play with the data to build a cumulative picture on international trade.
Building this larger picture from the ground up is an exercise which I believe resonates
with the main goal of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the Tableau software to create the graphic visualizations of my data. The first
graphic shown here shows the countries that received cotton exports from Egypt. The depth
of the blue shading indicates the relative ranks of these countries in terms of how many
bales were exported to them. The box graphic below shows the total number of bales and
their relative size to one another in more detail. Not surprisingly, the United Kingdom
by far received the most exports, almost 160,000 bales in total. This is roughly six
times greater than the second most popular export destination, France, with almost 26,000
bales in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first conclusion I derived from this data is that England was clearly the dominant
colonial power not just when it came to ruling Egypt, but when it came to extracting its
resources. No other country even came close to receiving as many cotton bales as England
over the course of the year, in fact, England’s cotton exports outnumbered the total
cotton exports received by all the other countries put together by quite a considerable
margin. This analysis, of course, is limited just to Egyptian sources of cotton and does
not speak to the relative economic power or consumption of these countries. However, it
does at least show that in the case of Egyptian cotton, one of the world’s largest cotton
markets at the time, England reigned supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting to note the global powers that received the most exports besides
England, specifically, France, Germany, Russia, Austria, and Italy. These powers were at
the time still the dominant global forces in European and world affairs. England’s
preferred exportation relationship with these powers speaks to the nature of the
international relations at the turn of the 20th century. Primarily, it suggests that
England and its British Empire were the most powerful and important international entity
at the time. This claim is supported by the fact that so many different powers around the
world chose to export resources from an English colony, including Russia and Japan which
were at war with one another at the time. This economic codependence amongst states that
were in present conflict is at the very least interesting for historians when economic
sanctions and exclusionary international trade deals are very prevalent in today’s world.
This is due, perhaps, to Britain’s central role in maintaining world peace and stability
during Pax Britannica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above chart shows the total cotton exportation by month in terms of bales. The most
obvious trend seen here is a decline from April to August, followed by a massive increase
in exports. This makes a certain amount of sense, since the cotton harvest ends in
November and thus would most likely result in an observable increase in exportation.
The magnitude at which it does remains puzzling, however. Contributing factors to this
phenomenon could be a worldwide spike in demand, a depreciation in cotton share value,
or a domestic policy by Britain to dramatically increase its exports from Egypt. To
satisfy this particular query, I analyzed individual monthly trends from five of the
biggest importers and created the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/16-analysis-grieco/grieco-Cottonmonth_huee329fa3128fd301a7e8ff9fdeadd0c8_25934_2d6386a9c12672d195fd5eaf43cbb7be.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this graph clearly shows, the most significant spike in exports during the month
of November came from England. This fact adds credence to the hypothesis that a domestic
policy in Britain was most likely the deciding factor in the November export spike, as
England’s roughly 80,000 cotton bales accounts for the clear majority of the total
123,014 cotton bales exported in the month of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;date-2016-12-07&#34;&gt;When I began the process of developing and exploring a relevant serial question for
this course, I decided to look through a financial lens. My decision to do so almost
inevitably brought me to the topic of the cotton trade in Egypt. After all, commercial
cotton production was the factor that brought modern finance to Egypt, for better or
for worse. The conclusions I drew from analyzing this data ended up telling a story that
went far beyond what I imagined was the likely scope of this project. For this reason,
I believe the ultimate point illustrated here is that small, individual bits of data or
seemingly insignificant recordings of events have the power to paint a very large and
interesting historical picture. Since the main goal of this microhistory course was to
prove that very point, I am glad that my research arrived at similar conclusions.

      <title>OCR Woes</title>
      <link>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-26-grieco-technical/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-11-26-grieco-technical/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my technical reflection, I have decided to discuss my experiences with the
OCR software, simply because it was easily the most time-consuming and tedious
portion of the technical aspects of this class. Since I have a Mac laptop, I
used the Cisdem OCR software rather than ABBY Finereader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I would like to say is the accuracy with which it translates
the text is quite disappointing. I would estimate that at MOST 60% of the
original text was transcribed to my text editor properly, and even more
frustrating was that specific letters were nearly almost incorrectly written,
for instance the letter “e” for the entirety of the respective pages was often
incorrectly recorded as the letter “a”, and vice versa. Furthermore,
spell-checking entire pages written in French was both lengthy and difficult,
particularly when I could not read some of the words and could not use context
clues to figure out what they were supposed to say (because I do not speak
French). At a certain point I had to simply accept that my XML pages were simply
going to be filled with egregious errors and a certain level of accuracy was
impossible to achieve (much to the chagrin of my mild OCD, but hey it was a
learning experience in patience and Zen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I was not a fan of the OCR software. It was most likely faster than
manually transcribing entire pages of the newspaper, but it was nonetheless
aggravating and stressful. Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=hkl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;British imperialism&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely crucial topic in understanding the development of world history, particularly during the period spanning the 19th and early 20th centuries. This era is often characterized by historians as &lt;em&gt;Pax Britannica&lt;/em&gt;, Latin for “British Peace.” It is so called due to the fact that Britain’s worldwide domination in the areas of economics, shipping, and military might kept most of Europe and the world in a state of relative peace. However, as the twentieth century came into view, global forces such as liberal ideals and nationalism threatened Britain’s role as the premier world superpower. Questions of how to proceed with its imperial rule began to multiply both in Britain and in its many colonies and territories abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third page of the May 3rd, 1905 edition of the Egyptian Gazette contains an editorial article &lt;a href=&#34;http://biography.yourdictionary.com/1st-earl-of-cromer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“Lord Cromer’s Sane Imperialism”&lt;/a&gt; that discusses a moderate “third way” of imperialism that rejects harsh materialistic concepts and embraces more liberal ideas of self-determination and government, when appropriate of course. This article maintains that Lord Cromer’s Annual Report on Egypt and the Sudan contain the necessary elements of pursuing a moderate approach for continuing the might of the Empire moving forward. This editorial provides a fascinating look at the prevailing dialogue of the day in one of Britain’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/egypt.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;most crucial imperial territories&lt;/a&gt; about the morality and governance of British imperialism at the dawn of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
